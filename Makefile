# The user-driven targets are:
#
# buildworld          - Rebuild *everything*, including glue to help do
#                       upgrades.
# quickworld	      - Skip bootstrap, build and cross-build tool steps
# realquickworld      - Skip above steps, plus depend
# crossworld	      - Just do the bootstrap, build, and cross-build steps
# installworld        - Install everything built by "buildworld".
# installworld-force  - Install everything built by "buildworld", special case for old systems
# world               - buildworld + installworld.
# buildkernel         - Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules from scratch
#			using build/bootstrap/cross tools from the last
#			buildworld.
# nativekernel	      - Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules from scratch
#		        using native tools.
# quickkernel	      - rebuild the kernel quickly (build or native), skip
#			the make depend step and do not clean out the obj
#			modules.
# installkernel       - Install the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# reinstallkernel     - Reinstall the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# kernel              - buildkernel + installkernel.
# preupgrade	      - Certain upgrades may have to be done before installworld.
#			installworld will complain if they have not been done.  This
#			target will do those upgrades... typically the addition of
#			new special groups and users used by installed utilities.
# upgrade             - Upgrade the files in /etc and also setup the rest
#			of the system for DragonFly. ex. two compilers
# most                - Build user commands, no libraries or include files.
# installmost         - Install user commands, no libraries or include files.
# rescue	      - Create rescue image in /boot
# backupworld         - Copies /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/lib
#                       /usr/libexec to manual backup dir.
# restoreworld        - Installs binaries from manual backup dir to world.
# restoreworld-auto   - Installs binaries from auto-backup dir to world;
#                       installworld target makes backup to auto-backup dir.
# backup-auto-clean   - Delete backup from auto-backup dir.
# backup-clean        - Delete backup from manual backup dir.
#
# This makefile is simple by design. The DragonFly make automatically reads
# /usr/share/mk/sys.mk unless the -m argument is specified on the 
# command line. By keeping this makefile simple, it doesn't matter too
# much how different the installed mk files are from those in the source
# tree. This makefile executes a child make process, forcing it to use
# the mk files from the source tree which are supposed to DTRT.
#
# The user-driven targets (as listed above) are implemented in Makefile.inc1.
#
# If you want to build your system from source be sure that /usr/obj has
# at least 800MB of diskspace available.
#
# For individuals wanting to build from the sources currently on their
# system, the simple instructions are:
#
# 1.  `cd /usr/src'  (or to the directory containing your source tree).
# 2.  `make world'
#
# For individuals wanting to upgrade their sources (even if only a
# delta of a few days):
#
# 1.  `cd /usr/src'       (or to the directory containing your source tree).
# 2.  `make buildworld'
# 3.  `make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE'   (default is X86_64_GENERIC).
# 4.  `make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE' (default is X86_64_GENERIC).
# 5.  `make installworld'
# 6.  `make upgrade'
# 7.  `reboot'
#
# See src/UPDATING `COMMON ITEMS' for more complete information.
#
# If TARGET_ARCH=arch (e.g. x86_64) is specified you can
# cross build world for other architectures using the buildworld target,
# and once the world is built you can cross build a kernel using the
# buildkernel target.
#
# Define the user-driven targets. These are listed here in alphabetical
# order, but that's not important.
