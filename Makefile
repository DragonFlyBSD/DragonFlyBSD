# The user-driven targets are:
#
# buildworld          - Rebuild *everything* but the kernel, including glue to
#                       help do upgrades.
# quickworld          - Skip bootstrap, build and cross-build tool steps.
# realquickworld      - Skip above steps, plus depend.
# crossworld          - Just do the bootstrap, build, and cross-build steps.
#
# buildportschroot    - Build the chroot environment for buildports
# buildports	      - Build dragonfly/base dports
#
# installworld        - Install everything built by "buildworld", and the
#                       rescue tools and initrd image if they do not exist.
# installworld-force  - Install everything built by "buildworld";
#                       special case for old systems.
# installports	      - Install ports built via buildports.
# cleanupports	      - umount all the special chroot mounts for buildports
#			and cleanup any dsynth mounts that might be left over.
#
# world               - buildworld + installworld.
# buildkernel         - Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules from scratch
#                       using build/bootstrap/cross tools from the last
#                       buildworld.
# nativekernel        - Rebuild the kernel and the kernel-modules from scratch
#                       using native tools.
# quickkernel         - Rebuild the kernel quickly (build or native), and do
#                       not clean out the obj modules.
# realquickkernel     - Like quickkernel, but skips depend too.
# installkernel       - Install the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# reinstallkernel     - Reinstall the kernel and the kernel-modules.
# kernel              - buildkernel + installkernel.
# preinstall          - Do certain operations (typically the addition of new
#                       users and groups used by utilities to be installed)
#                       before doing installworld.
# upgrade             - Upgrade the files in /etc and also setup the rest
#                       of the system for DragonFly. ex. two compilers.
# build-all           - Runs buildworld and buildkernel both with -j hw.ncpu
#			Also runs buildportschroot and buildports
# install-all         - Runs installkernel, installworld and upgrade all with
#                       -j 1
#
# initrd              - Install the statically linked rescue tools and the
#                       initrd image built by "buildworld".
# backupworld         - Copy /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/lib
#                       /usr/libexec to manual backup dir.
# restoreworld        - Install binaries from manual backup dir to world.
# restoreworld-auto   - Install binaries from auto-backup dir to world;
#                       installworld target makes backup to auto-backup dir.
# backup-auto-clean   - Delete backup from auto-backup dir.
# backup-clean        - Delete backup from manual backup dir.
#
# This makefile is simple by design. The DragonFly make automatically reads
# /usr/share/mk/sys.mk unless the -m argument is specified on the
# command line. By keeping this makefile simple, it doesn't matter too
# much how different the installed mk files are from those in the source
# tree. This makefile executes a child make process, forcing it to use
# the mk files from the source tree which are supposed to DTRT.
#
# Most of the user-driven targets (as listed above) are implemented in
# Makefile.inc1.
#
# For individuals wanting to build from the sources currently on their
# system, the simple instructions are:
#
# 1.  `cd /usr/src'  (or to the directory containing your source tree).
# 2.  `make world'
#
# For individuals wanting to upgrade their sources (even if only a
# delta of a few days):
#
# 1.  `cd /usr/src'       (or to the directory containing your source tree).
# 2.  `make buildworld'
# 3.  `make buildkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE'   (default X86_64_GENERIC).
# 4.  `make installkernel KERNCONF=YOUR_KERNEL_HERE' (default X86_64_GENERIC).
# 5.  `make installworld'
# 6.  `make upgrade'
# 7.  `reboot'
# 8.  `make initrd'  (after making sure that the new world works well).
#
# If TARGET_ARCH=arch (e.g. x86_64) is specified you can
# cross build world for other architectures using the buildworld target,
# and once the world is built you can cross build a kernel using the
# buildkernel target.
#
# For more information, see the build(7) manual page.
