+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 4.0 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

BINUTILS 2.25 REPLACES 2.22, PRIMARY
------------------------------------

The oldest of the two versions of Binutils, version 2.22, was removed
and replaced with Binutils 2.25.  It becomes the primary version version
of binutils and version 2.24 becomes the alternate.  There are 8 current
CVE written against 2.24, so for security reasons version 2.25 should
always be used.

The accepted values of BINUTILSVER are now "binutils225" (default) and
"binutils224".  The building of Binutils 2.24 can be prevented by setting
NO_ALTBINUTILS=yes in make.conf.

LOADER OPTIONS CHANGED
----------------------

Right after the development branch started, the Fred art accompanying the
loader menu was improved.  The line between Fred and the menu was removed
by default (but can optionally be returned) and the placement shifted as
a result.  The drawing was improved, and the colored version was improved,
changing the eyes and wing color from white to red.  A new color version
of Fred was added, one with a blue scheme.

The loader menu defaults have changed since release 4.0:  The vertical
line was removed, the loader is displayed in color by default*, and the
blue scheme is used.

The loader.conf changes are:
loader_color:   option has been removed
loader_plain:   option has been added, it changed menu to monochrome
fred_is_red:    changes color scheme from blue to red
fred_is_blue:   option existed only on 4.1, it has been removed
fred_separated: Adds line between Fred and menu (as seen previously)

* If loader.conf defines "console" as "comconsole" or "console" is defined
  in the environment as "comconsole" then color will not be displayed,
  even if loader_plain value is "NO".

SENDMAIL REMOVED FROM BASE
--------------------------

The only Mail Transfer Agent provided now is DragonFly Mail Agent (dma).
If the system being upgraded is still configured to use the sendmail
binaries from base, the "make upgrade" command will fail.

The administrator must change /etc/mail/mailer.conf to switch the
mailwrapper to dma or a DPorts-based MTA prior to running the upgrade
command that permanently removes sendmail executables and could
potentially break a running mail server.

Refer: http://www.dragonflybsd.com/docs/docs/newhandbook/mta/ for
detailed instructions on how to configure the MTA selection.

_KPOSIX_VERSION and P1003_1B OPTIONS REMOVED
--------------------------------------------

The _KPOSIX_VERSION and P1003_1B kernel options have been changed to
no-ops. They can be removed from custom kernel configurations.

SOUND SYSTEM UPDATED FROM FreeBSD 11-CURRENT
--------------------------------------------

Many more sound devices may be detected.

If the default device choosen isn't to your liking, setting the sysctl
hw.snd.default_unit to a different number will change it.

SCTP SUPPORT DROPPED
--------------------

Support for the SCTP protocol has been removed.

OLD USB DRIVERS REMOVED
-----------------------

The old USB stack, along with the kernel config option "device oldusb"
and the make.conf variable "WANT_OLDUSB" have been removed. This means
that for custom kernel configuration files which were derived from a
GENERIC or X86_64_GENERIC file prior to making the usb4bsd stack default,
various (old USB stack specific) devices will now complain about being
unknown:

  * oldusb	(obviously)
  * natausb	(not yet ported to usb4bsd)
  * rue		(not yet ported to usb4bsd)
  * ugen	(no longer needed in usb4bsd)
  * urio	(not yet ported to usb4bsd)
  * uscanner	(no longer needed in usb4bsd)

They should be removed or commented out in such custom kernel configs.

GCC 5
-----

The GCC 4.4 compiler has been retired.  It has been replaced by a GCC 5.1.
The following make.conf variables no longer work: NO_GCC44, NO_OBJC, and
NO_CXX.  The latter was never documented and the latest versions of GCC are
partially written in C++ so a C++ compiler is no longer optional.  In
practical terms it has not been optional for many years as other base
components are also written in C++.  The resource savings by avoiding
building Objective-C compiler is so small, the complexity added by NO_OBJC
internally was deemed a bad tradeoff so that is the reason for its removal.
Also note that no "info" pages are installed with GCC 5.  After this entry
was originally written, all info pages were removed from DragonFly.

GCC 5.1 has been designated as the primary compiler.  As such, there is a
new make.conf variable, NO_ALTCOMPILER.  It will block the rebuilding of
the designated secondary compiler, GCC 4.7.  However, while DPorts
primarily uses GCC 5 to build ports now, it still uses GCC 4.7 as well, so
if building ports from source is desired, don't block building of the
secondary compiler.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 3.8 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

SMP AND DEVICE_POLLING OPTIONS MADE UNKNOWN
-------------------------------------------

DEVICE_POLLING was replaced by IFPOLL_ENABLE and the former SMP code is
the default now (even on single-core systems), both for, like, 21 months.
We kept the options around as no-ops as a convenience, to allow people
using the same config for the then current release and the then current
master. That period is now over, so any configs still having those
options have to be adjusted.

SYSVIPC SYSCALLS MADE NON-OPTIONAL
----------------------------------

The code related to the SYSVMSG, SYSVSEM and SYSVSHM kernel options is
now compiled in by default. The options are no-ops for now.

DEFAULT DRIVER CHANGED FOR LSI "THUNDERBOLT" SERIES RAID CONTROLLERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The default driver for those controllers is now mrsas(4) due to reports
of file system corruption using the mfi(4) driver. The whole issue (and
how to deal with potential problems when switching) was explained here:

http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2014-July/128703.html

A tunable is provided for letting those controllers still attach via
the mfi(4) driver, hw.mrsas.mfi_enable (see mrsas(4) manual page).

OLDER NETWORK DRIVERS MOVED TO I386 ONLY
----------------------------------------

The following drivers have been made i386 only: ed(4), sr(4), ng_sync_ar
and ng_sync_sr. ed(4) used to be in X86_64_GENERIC, so it has to be
removed in kernel configs derived from X86_64_GENERIC.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 3.6 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

UPDATE FROM MOST RECENT 3.6
---------------------------

Versions of 3.6 built before June 25th have a bug where installworld might 
crash during installation of the new initrd.  Upgrade to the latest version
of 3.6 before updating to 3.8 or later.

ATM, IPX, NCP AND NWFS SUPPORT DROPPED
--------------------------------------

Support for the IPX and NCP network protocols and for mouting NetWare
file systems has been dropped. Dito for ATM protocol support.

INITRD IMAGES NOW INSTALLED BY DEFAULT
--------------------------------------

An initial ramdisk image is now installed in /boot/kernel/initrd.img.gz

Older images installed under the file name of initrd.img will be removed
automatically by the make upgrade process.

USB4BSD IS NOW THE DEFAULT USB STACK
------------------------------------

To get back to the old stack, put "WANT_OLDUSB=yes" in /etc/make.conf and
replace "device usb" with "device oldusb" in the kernel configuration.

MORE ISA SUPPORT DROPPED
------------------------

ISA support has been dropped from the following drivers: adv(4), an(4),
ar(4), cs(4), digi(4), ed(4), ep(4), ex(4), fe(4), lnc(4), sbni(4),
si(4), sn(4), and stg(4).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 3.4 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

ABI CHANGE
----------

Installed third-party software (dports) will have to be rebuilt after upgrade,
or reinstalled from binary packages.

UPDATING FROM 3.4 TO 3.6
------------------------

This only applies for this specific upgrade due to locale changes; it is 
not needed for upgrades after 3.6.  Please update in this order:

make buildworld
make buildkernel
make installworld
make installkernel
*reboot*
make upgrade

See this mailing list post for details:
http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2013-September/090163.html

CYRIX OPTIONS REMOVED
---------------------

The following Cyrix related options have been removed: CPU_BTB_EN,
CPU_CYRIX_NO_LOCK, CPU_DIRECT_MAPPED_CACHE, CPU_DISABLE_5X86_LSSER,
CPU_FASTER_5X86_FPU, CPU_IORT, CPU_LOOP_EN, CPU_RSTK_EN, CPU_SUSP_HLT,
CYRIX_CACHE_WORKS, and CYRIX_CACHE_REALLY_WORKS

ISA SUPPORT REMOVED FROM RP(4)
------------------------------

ISA support has been removed from the rp(4) driver. It is now PCI only.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 3.2 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

COMPAT_SUNOS OPTION REMOVED
---------------------------

The COMPAT_SUNOS option has been removed. It was meant to provide binary
compatibility with SunOS 4.x for the sparc32 port of 4.4BSD.

ISA SOUND CARD SUPPORT REMOVED
------------------------------

The following modules have been removed (all for ISA sound cards):
snd_ad1816.ko, snd_ess.ko, snd_mss.ko, snd_sb8.ko, snd_sb16.ko, snd_sbc.ko

GCC 4.7
-------

DragonFly has switched base compilers.  GCC 4.7 is now the default
compiler and GCC 4.4 is the alternative compiler.  The "NO_GCC47" make
variable ceases to work now.

Users who wish to build only GCC 4.7 have to use NO_GCC44 in the
/etc/make.conf to prohibit GCC 4.4 from building.  However, using it is
highly discouraged.  There are a few packages in pkgsrc that do not build
with GCC 4.7 and the new "DPorts" system uses GCC 4.4 by default.  At
this time, it is recommended to keep both compilers on the base system.

SMP OPTION REMOVED
------------------

The SMP kernel option has been made a no-op. All kernels now feature SMP
support. If you have 'options SMP' in your kernel config, you can as well
remove it.

DEVICE_POLLING OPTION REPLACED BY IFPOLL_ENABLE OPTION, KTR_POLLING REMOVED
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DEVICE_POLLING kernel option has been made a no-op and it has been
replaced by IFPOLL_ENABLE.  If you have 'options DEVICE_POLLING' in your
kernel config, you need to change it to IFPOLL_ENABLE.

Also, the KTR_POLLING kernel option has been removed, so it must be
removed from kernel configs that have it.

BUSLOGIC, CYCLADES AND STALLION ISA SUPPORT REMOVED
---------------------------------------------------

The bt(4) driver for Buslogic SCSI adapters has been made PCI only. ISA
cards will no longer be detected.

The same has been done for Stallion multiport serial controllers. stli(4)
has been completely removed (along with the stlload(8) and stlstty(8)
utilities) and stl(4) was changed to support only PCI cards. Similarly,
ISA support was removed from cy(4) too. All these drivers are i386 only.

COMPAT_OLDISA OPTION GONE
-------------------------

The i386 specific COMPAT_OLDISA kernel option has been removed, since
nothing needs it anymore.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 3.0 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

APIC_IO OPTION REMOVED
----------------------

The APIC_IO kernel option is no longer accepted after having been without
effect for a while. The hw.ioapic_enable tunable now serves its purpose.
If you have 'options APIC_IO' in your kernel config, you'll have to
remove it.

WATCHDOG_ENABLE & HW_WDOG OPTIONS REMOVED
-----------------------------------------

The wdog framework is now compiled into our kernels by default, so the
options are no longer needed.

DOSCMD(1) REMOVED
-----------------

doscmd(1) has been removed. It was i386 only. The doscmd(1) specific
NO_X make.conf option was removed too.

GCC 4.7
-------

GCC 4.7 has been brought in and replaces GCC 4.1 as DragonFly's non-
default compiler in base (default is still GCC 4.4).

Users who wish to build only GCC 4.4 have to replace NO_GCC41 with
NO_GCC47 in /etc/make.conf.

USB4BSD
-------

A new USB stack (from FreeBSD) has been brought in. The following
modules have been ported so far: usb, uhci, ohci, ehci, xhci, umass,
usfs, uether, if_axe, if_udav, ukbd, ums, uep, uhid, usb_quirk,
and uaudio.

It is not yet the default. To activate it, WANT_USB4BSD=yes has to
be put in make.conf and device "usb4bsd" (quotes needed) has to
replace device usb in the kernel config. After that, a full
build/install/upgrade cycle is needed.

Note that this is experimental and incomplete, but we are interested
in hearing about issues with it, of course.

ISA SUPPORT REMOVED FROM AIC-6260/6360 DRIVER
---------------------------------------------

ISA adapter support was dropped from the aic(4) driver.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 2.10 TO LATER VERSIONS               +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

SEVERAL ISA DRIVERS REMOVED
---------------------------

The following ISA only drivers have been removed along with a couple of
associated userland tools:

aha(4)
asc(4) & sasc(1)
ctx
dgb(4)
el(4)
gpib
gsc(4) & sgsc(1)
ie(4)
labpc(4)
le(4)
mse(4)
rc(4)
rdp(4)
spigot
tw(4) & xten(1) & xtend(8)
wl(4) & wlconfig(8)
wt(4)

Note that two of these drivers (aha(4) and ie(4)) are in our GENERIC
config and one (aha(4)) is in our X86_64_GENERIC kernel configuration
file.

If buildkernel complains about any of these drivers, just remove them
from your kernel configuration.

BINUTILS 2.20
-------------
Binutils 2.20 has been removed in favor of Binutils 2.22.  The accepted
values of BINUTILSVERS are now binutils221 and binutils222 (default).

BUILDWORLD/-KERNEL PARALLELIZATION WORK
---------------------------------------
Due to changes in the way we build with more than one make job, you
will have to update install(1) and mkdir(1) prior to buildworld if you
want to build with 'make -j':

cd /usr/src/usr.bin/xinstall; make; make install; make clean
cd /usr/src/bin/mkdir; make; make install; make clean

DMA(8) UPGRADE
--------------
dma(8) has been upgraded to v0.7 which no longer supports the
/etc/dma/virtusertable. Some of its functionality has been replaced
with the MASQUERADE keyword and the EMAIL environment variable (see
the dma(8) manual page).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 2.8 TO LATER VERSIONS                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

GCC 4.4 & BINUTILS 2.21
-----------------------

GCC 4.4 has been made DragonFly's default compiler and Binutils 2.21 has
been made DragonFly's default Binutils.

That means that any settings that set CCVER to 'gcc44' are not needed
anymore. Instead, CCVER can be set to 'gcc41' to go back to using
GCC 4.1.

It also means that 'binutils221' as a value for BINUTILSVER has no
effect anymore. 2.17 has been removed and 'binutils220' is available
as an option.

The NO_GCC44 option has been removed and will not affect the build
anymore. There is now a NO_GCC41 option that will prevent GCC 4.1 from
building in a similar fashion.

Note that you must do a full buildworld/buildkernel for upgrading.

pkg_radd settings
-----------------

The config file for pkg_radd has moved from /etc/settings.conf to 
/etc/pkg_radd.conf.  Save the contents of settings.conf before upgrading
if this is needed.  This warning only applies if /etc/settings.conf 
exists.  pkg_radd will continue to work with defaults.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         20100927							+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 2.6 to 2.8 or HEAD			+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

OpenSSL
--------

OpenSSL has been upgraded, and SHLIB_MAJOR was bumped for libssh and libcrypto.
This shouldn't break any 3rd-party software, but you'll need to recompile your
3rd-party software if you want it to link against the new version of OpenSSL.

Loader
-------

A new loader (dloader) has been added which better handles booting from
multiple kernel/module versions.

To upgrade (Only for this upgrade, for post 2.8 upgrades see GENERAL below)

	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make installworld
	make upgrade
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>

Note that you must installworld and run the 'upgrade' target before
installing the new kernel.

BIND
-----

BIND has been removed from the base system.  The ldns and drill tools have 
been added for basic functionality.  Use 'drill' where you would normally 
use nslookup or dig, or install BIND from pkgsrc.  It's available as 
net/bind95, net/bind96, or net/bind97 as of this writing.

This only affects older systems upgrading to 2.8.  New 2.8+ installs 
include BIND as a pkgsrc package.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY ON AN EXISTING DRAGONFLY SYSTEM		+
+				GENERAL					+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Instructions on how to obtain and maintain DragonFly source code using git
are in the development(7) manual page.

To upgrade a DragonFly system from sources you run the following sequence:

	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installworld

You will also want to run the 'upgrade' target to upgrade your /etc and the
rest of your system.  The upgrade target is aware of stale files created by
older DragonFly installations and should delete them automatically.

	make upgrade

See the build(7) manual page for further information.

Once you've done a full build of the world and kernel you can do incremental
upgrades of either by using the 'quickworld' and 'quickkernel' targets
instead of 'buildworld' and 'buildkernel'.  If you have any problems with
the quick targets, try updating your repo first, and then a full buildworld
and buildkernel as shown above, before asking for help.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING FROM DRAGONFLY <= 2.0 TO DRAGONFLY >= 2.1		+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In 2.1 kernel and modules has moved to boot directory.  For most cases
this is handled automatically by 'make upgrade'.  A few cases needs manual
intervention:

 * When installing a kernel without first doing a make buildworld,
   installworld and upgrade to the same DESTDIR as kernel:
   make DESTDIR/boot directory and move kernel and modules into this boot
   directory; also move kernel.old and modules.old.
   Typical example is vkernel(7), use (no modules used):

	cd /var/vkernel
	mkdir boot
	chflags noschg kernel
	mv kernel kernel.old boot
	chflags schg boot/kernel
	
 * When using a boot-only partition, /boot/loader.rc needs to be edited:
   delete occurrences of '/boot/'.
   These occurences can normally be deleted in any case, see loader(8).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING FROM DRAGONFLY <= 1.8 TO DRAGONFLY >= 1.9		+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In 1.9 major changes to the disk management infrastructure have taken
place.  make upgrade may not catch all of your disk devices in /dev,
so after upgrading be sure to cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV <blah> where <blah>
are all of your disk devices.  HOWEVER, from late 2.3 on we run devfs
and MAKEDEV no longer exists.

The biggest changes in 1.9 are:

(1) That whole-slice devices such as da0s1 no longer share the same device
    id as partition c devices such as da0s1c.

(2) The whole-disk device (e.g. da0) is full raw access to the disk,
    with no snooping or reserved sectors.  Consequently you cannot run
    disklabel on this device.  Instead you must run disklabel on a
    whole-slice device.

(3) The 'compatibility' partitions now use slice 0 in the device name,
    so instead of da0a you must specify da0s0a.  Also, as per (1) above,
    accessing the disklabel for the compatibility partitions must be
    done via slice 0 (da0s0).

(4) Many device drivers that used to fake up labels, such as CD, ACD, VN,
    and CCD now run through the disk management layer and are assigned
    real disk management devices.   VN and CCD in particular do not usually
    use a MBR and disklabels must be accessed through the compatibility
    slice 0.  Your /etc/ccd.conf file still specifies 'ccd0', though, you
    don't name it 'ccd0s0' in the config file.

Generally speaking, you have to get used to running fdisk and disklabel on
the correctly specified device names.  A lot of the wiggle, such as running
disklabel on a partition, has been removed.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Kerberos IV
-------------

Kerberos IV (eBones) was removed from the tree, please consider moving to
Kerberos 5 (Heimdal).

> Package Management System
---------------------------

Starting with the 1.4 release, DragonFly uses NetBSD's pkgsrc package
management system.  The necessary tools to build and maintain packages
are provided in /usr/pkg/bin and /usr/pkg/sbin.  Make sure that these
directories are in your PATH variable.

In order to obtain a reasonably current snapshot of the pkgsrc tree, use
the tarball from NetBSD:

	fetch -o /tmp/pkgsrc.tar.gz ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc.tar.gz
	cd /usr; tar -xzf /tmp/pkgsrc.tar.gz; chown -R root:wheel pkgsrc

This tree can then be kept up to date with cvs update:

	cd /usr/pkgsrc; cvs up

NOTE! If you upgraded from a pre-1.4 system to 1.4 or later, you need to
build and install the pkgsrc bootstrap manually:

	cd /usr/pkgsrc/bootstrap
	./bootstrap --pkgdbdir /var/db/pkg --prefix /usr/pkg

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY ON AN EXISTING DRAGONFLY SYSTEM		+
+         UPDATING FROM PRE-1.2 SYSTEMS OR FreeBSD 4.x TO               +
+         DRAGONFLY 1.3+ (EITHER PREVIEW or HEAD)                       +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The compatibility shims for the build environment have been removed, you
have to update to DragonFly 1.2 release branch first.

The default PAM configuration has moved from /etc/pam.conf to /etc/pam.d/.
The existing configuration can be converted using /etc/pam.d/convert.sh.
Entries in /etc/pam.d/ override entries in /etc/pam.conf. In addition
the pam_skey.so module was retired, you have to remove it manually from
your configuration, when you convert it.

> Required user and group IDs when upgrading from either FreeBSD or DragonFly
---------------------

The following users may be missing from your password file.  Use vipw and
add any that are missing:

smmsp:*:25:25::0:0:Sendmail Submission User:/var/spool/clientmqueue:/sbin/nologin
_pflogd:*:64:64::0:0:pflogd privsep user:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin

The following groups may be missing from your group file.  Use vi /etc/group
and add any that are missing:

smmsp:*:25:
authpf:*:63:
_pflogd:*:64:


> Upgrading to DragonFly from FreeBSD
---------------------

You can build the DragonFly world and DragonFly kernels on a FreeBSD-4.x or
FreeBSD-5.x machine and then install DragonFly over FreeBSD, replacing
FreeBSD.  Note that the DragonFly buildworld target does not try to reuse
make depend information, it starts from scratch, so no pre-cleaning of the
object hierarchy is necessary.

	# get the CVS repository (it is placed in /home/dcvs, 500MB).
	# Please use the -h option and a mirror site to pull the 
	# initial repository, but feel free to use the main repository
	# machine to pull updates.
	cvsup /usr/share/examples/cvsup/DragonFly-cvs-supfile
	# install the source from the CVS hierarchy (remove preexisting
	# FreeBSD src first) (500MB)
	cd /usr
	rm -rf src
	cvs -R -d /home/dcvs checkout -P src

	# build it (500MB used in /usr/obj)
	#
	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>

Once you have built DragonFly you have to install it over FreeBSD.  Since
DragonFly does not track changes made by FreeBSD to its include file 
hierarchy and include file pollution can cause all sorts of unexpected
compilation issues to come up, it is best to wipe your include hierarchy
prior to installing DragonFly.  Note that you should not wipe any installed
FreeBSD header files or binaries until after you have successfully completed
the build steps above.

	rm -rf /usr/include
	mkdir /usr/include
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installworld

Then you need to upgrade your system.  DragonFly's 'make upgrade' target 
will unconditionally upgrade the /etc files that sysops do not usually
mess around with, such as the files in /etc/rc.d.  It will also remove any
obsolete files such as utilities and manpages that have been removed from
the system since the version you're coming from.  If you are unsure we 
recommend that you make a backup of at least your /etc before applying
this step.  Note that DragonFly's RC system is basically RCNG from
FreeBSD-5, but there are some differences in the contents of the RC files.

	make upgrade

NOTE! Never do a 'make upgrade' before 'make installworld' has been run.
Doing so might leave your system in an unusable state.

Finally we recommend that you do an 'ls -lta BLAH' for /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin,
/usr/bin, and /usr/lib, and remove any stale files that you find.  Please
report these files to the DragonFly developers so that they can be added to
the 'upgrade' target.
