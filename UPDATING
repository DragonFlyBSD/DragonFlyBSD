+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 2.8 to later versions                +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

GCC 4.4
-------

GCC 4.4 has been made DragonFly's default compiler.

That means that any settings that set CCVER to 'gcc44' are not needed
anymore. Instead, CCVER can be set to 'gcc41' to go back to using
GCC 4.1.

The NO_GCC44 option has been removed and will not affect the build
anymore. There is now a NO_GCC41 option that will prevent GCC 4.1 from
building in a similar fashion.

Note that you must do a full buildworld/buildkernel for upgrading.

pkg_radd settings
-----------------

The config file for pkg_radd has moved from /etc/settings.conf to 
/etc/pkg_radd.conf.  Save the contents of settings.conf before upgrading
if this is needed.  This warning only applies if /etc/settings.conf 
exists.  pkg_radd will continue to work with defaults.

+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY FROM 2.6 to 2.8 or HEAD			+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

OpenSSL
--------

OpenSSL has been upgraded, and SHLIB_MAJOR was bumped for libssh and libcrypto.
This shouldn't break any 3rd-party software, but you'll need to recompile your
3rd-party software if you want it to link against the new version of OpenSSL.

Loader
-------

A new loader (dloader) has been added which better handles booting from
multiple kernel/module versions.

To upgrade (Only for this upgrade, for post 2.8 upgrades see GENERAL below)

	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make installworld
	make upgrade
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>

Note that you must installworld and run the 'upgrade' target before
installing the new kernel.

BIND
-----

BIND has been removed from the base system.  The ldns and drill tools have 
been added for basic functionality.  Use 'drill' where you would normally 
use nslookup or dig, or install BIND from pkgsrc.  It's available as 
net/bind95, net/bind96, or net/bind97 as of this writing.

This only affects older systems upgrading to 2.8.  New 2.8+ installs 
include BIND as a pkgsrc package.

+         UPGRADING DRAGONFLY ON AN EXISTING DRAGONFLY SYSTEM		+
+				GENERAL					+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Instructions on how to obtain and maintain DragonFly source code using git
are in the development(7) manual page.

To upgrade a DragonFly system from sources you run the following sequence:

	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installworld

You will also want to run the 'upgrade' target to upgrade your /etc and the
rest of your system.  The upgrade target is aware of stale files created by
older DragonFly installations and should delete them automatically.

	make upgrade

See the build(7) manual page for further information.

Once you've done a full build of the world and kernel you can do incremental
upgrades of either by using the 'quickworld' and 'quickkernel' targets
instead of 'buildworld' and 'buildkernel'.  If you have any problems with
the quick targets, try updating your repo first, and then a full buildworld
and buildkernel as shown above, before asking for help.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING FROM DRAGONFLY <= 2.0 TO DRAGONFLY >= 2.1		+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In 2.1 kernel and modules has moved to boot directory.  For most cases
this is handled automatically by 'make upgrade'.  A few cases needs manual
intervention:

 * When installing a kernel without first doing a make buildworld,
   installworld and upgrade to the same DESTDIR as kernel:
   make DESTDIR/boot directory and move kernel and modules into this boot
   directory; also move kernel.old and modules.old.
   Typical example is vkernel(7), use (no modules used):

	cd /var/vkernel
	mkdir boot
	chflags noschg kernel
	mv kernel kernel.old boot
	chflags schg boot/kernel
	
 * When using a boot-only partition, /boot/loader.rc needs to be edited:
   delete occurrences of '/boot/'.
   These occurences can normally be deleted in any case, see loader(8).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
+         UPGRADING FROM DRAGONFLY <= 1.8 TO DRAGONFLY >= 1.9		+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In 1.9 major changes to the disk management infrastructure have taken
place.  make upgrade may not catch all of your disk devices in /dev,
so after upgrading be sure to cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV <blah> where <blah>
are all of your disk devices.  HOWEVER, from late 2.3 on we run devfs
and MAKEDEV no longer exists.

The biggest changes in 1.9 are:

(1) That whole-slice devices such as da0s1 no longer share the same device
    id as partition c devices such as da0s1c.

(2) The whole-disk device (e.g. da0) is full raw access to the disk,
    with no snooping or reserved sectors.  Consequently you cannot run
    disklabel on this device.  Instead you must run disklabel on a
    whole-slice device.

(3) The 'compatibility' partitions now use slice 0 in the device name,
    so instead of da0a you must specify da0s0a.  Also, as per (1) above,
    accessing the disklabel for the compatibility partitions must be
    done via slice 0 (da0s0).

(4) Many device drivers that used to fake up labels, such as CD, ACD, VN,
    and CCD now run through the disk management layer and are assigned
    real disk management devices.   VN and CCD in particular do not usually
    use a MBR and disklabels must be accessed through the compatibility
    slice 0.  Your /etc/ccd.conf file still specifies 'ccd0', though, you
    don't name it 'ccd0s0' in the config file.

Generally speaking, you have to get used to running fdisk and disklabel on
the correctly specified device names.  A lot of the wiggle, such as running
disklabel on a partition, has been removed.

> Kerberos IV
-------------

Kerberos IV (eBones) was removed from the tree, please consider moving to
Kerberos 5 (Heimdal).

> Package Management System
---------------------------

Starting with the 1.4 release, DragonFly uses NetBSD's pkgsrc package
management system.  The necessary tools to build and maintain packages
are provided in /usr/pkg/bin and /usr/pkg/sbin.  Make sure that these
directories are in your PATH variable.

In order to obtain a reasonably current snapshot of the pkgsrc tree, use
the tarball from NetBSD:

	fetch -o /tmp/pkgsrc.tar.gz ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc.tar.gz
	cd /usr; tar -xzf /tmp/pkgsrc.tar.gz; chown -R root:wheel pkgsrc

This tree can then be kept up to date with cvs update:

	cd /usr/pkgsrc; cvs up

NOTE! If you upgraded from a pre-1.4 system to 1.4 or later, you need to
build and install the pkgsrc bootstrap manually:

	cd /usr/pkgsrc/bootstrap
	./bootstrap --pkgdbdir /var/db/pkg --prefix /usr/pkg

+         DRAGONFLY 1.3+ (EITHER PREVIEW or HEAD)                       +
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The compatibility shims for the build environment have been removed, you
have to update to DragonFly 1.2 release branch first.

The default PAM configuration has moved from /etc/pam.conf to /etc/pam.d/.
The existing configuration can be converted using /etc/pam.d/convert.sh.
Entries in /etc/pam.d/ override entries in /etc/pam.conf. In addition
the pam_skey.so module was retired, you have to remove it manually from
your configuration, when you convert it.

> Required user and group IDs when upgrading from either FreeBSD or DragonFly
---------------------

The following users may be missing from your password file.  Use vipw and
add any that are missing:

smmsp:*:25:25::0:0:Sendmail Submission User:/var/spool/clientmqueue:/sbin/nologin
_pflogd:*:64:64::0:0:pflogd privsep user:/var/empty:/sbin/nologin

The following groups may be missing from your group file.  Use vi /etc/group
and add any that are missing:

smmsp:*:25:
authpf:*:63:
_pflogd:*:64:


> Upgrading to DragonFly from FreeBSD
---------------------

You can build the DragonFly world and DragonFly kernels on a FreeBSD-4.x or
FreeBSD-5.x machine and then install DragonFly over FreeBSD, replacing
FreeBSD.  Note that the DragonFly buildworld target does not try to reuse
make depend information, it starts from scratch, so no pre-cleaning of the
object hierarchy is necessary.

	# get the CVS repository (it is placed in /home/dcvs, 500MB).
	# Please use the -h option and a mirror site to pull the 
	# initial repository, but feel free to use the main repository
	# machine to pull updates.
	cvsup /usr/share/examples/cvsup/DragonFly-cvs-supfile
	# install the source from the CVS hierarchy (remove preexisting
	# FreeBSD src first) (500MB)
	cd /usr
	rm -rf src
	cvs -R -d /home/dcvs checkout -P src

	# build it (500MB used in /usr/obj)
	#
	cd /usr/src
	make buildworld
	make buildkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>

Once you have built DragonFly you have to install it over FreeBSD.  Since
DragonFly does not track changes made by FreeBSD to its include file 
hierarchy and include file pollution can cause all sorts of unexpected
compilation issues to come up, it is best to wipe your include hierarchy
prior to installing DragonFly.  Note that you should not wipe any installed
FreeBSD header files or binaries until after you have successfully completed
the build steps above.

	rm -rf /usr/include
	mkdir /usr/include
	make installkernel KERNCONF=<KERNELNAME>
	make installworld

Then you need to upgrade your system.  DragonFly's 'make upgrade' target 
will unconditionally upgrade the /etc files that sysops do not usually
mess around with, such as the files in /etc/rc.d.  It will also remove any
obsolete files such as utilities and manpages that have been removed from
the system since the version you're coming from.  If you are unsure we 
recommend that you make a backup of at least your /etc before applying
this step.  Note that DragonFly's RC system is basically RCNG from
FreeBSD-5, but there are some differences in the contents of the RC files.

	make upgrade

NOTE! Never do a 'make upgrade' before 'make installworld' has been run.
Doing so might leave your system in an unusable state.

Finally we recommend that you do an 'ls -lta BLAH' for /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin,
/usr/bin, and /usr/lib, and remove any stale files that you find.  Please
report these files to the DragonFly developers so that they can be added to
the 'upgrade' target.
