.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libhammer.h
.Ft libhammer_volinfo_t
.Fn libhammer_get_volinfo "const char *path"
.Ft libhammer_pfsinfo_t
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs "libhammer_volinfo_t volinfo"

.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs "libhammer_pfsinfo_t pfsinfo"

.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs "libhammer_pfsinfo_t pfsinfo"
.Ft void
.Fn libhammer_free_volinfo "libhammer_volinfo_t volinfo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn libhammer_get_volinfo
iterates all the PFSs from a given path belonging to a
.Nm HAMMER
filesystem and returns
.Vt libhammer_volinfo_t
.Fa volinfo
which holds a
.Nm TAILQ
of
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo
structs, one per PFS found.
.Pp
The list of found PFSs can be iterated with
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs ,
.Fn libhammer_get_last_pfs ,
.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs .
.Pp
Note that to use the next and previous functions described above you need
to store the returning
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo_t
value from the first and last functions.
.Pp
.Fn libhammer_free_volinfo
frees up all the memory allocated previously by
.Fn libhammer_get_volinfo .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn libhammer_get_volinfo
returns a
.Vt libhammer_volinfo_t
in any case where path is in a
.Nm HAMMER
filesystem scope or
.Dv NULL
if there was any other problem.
You can check
.Nm errno
in the error cases.
.Pp
.Fn libhammer_get_first_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_last_pfs
must return a
.Vt libhammer_pfs_t
if the
.Fa volinfo
passed in is valid.
.Fn libhammer_get_next_pfs
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_pfs
return a
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo_t
or
.Dv NULL
in case there are no more elements.
