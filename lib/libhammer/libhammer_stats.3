.Sh DESCRIPTION
The set of functions described above will help to gather
statistics of the mounted

.Pp
All the functions will take argument
.Ar value
to store the value for the sysctl requested, except for
.Fn libhammer_btree_stats
and
.Fn libhammer_io_stats
which will take structures to store groups of values.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
