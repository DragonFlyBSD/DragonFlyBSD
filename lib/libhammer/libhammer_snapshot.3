.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn libhammer_pfs_get_snapshots
gathers all the snapshot information for the PFS specified in
.Fa pip .
.Pp
The list of snapshots can be iterated with
.Fn libhammer_get_first_snap ,
.Fn libhammer_get_last_snap ,
.Fn libhammer_get_next_snap
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_snap .
.Pp
Note that to use the next and previous functions described above you need
to store the returning
.Vt libhammer_snapinfo_t
value from the first and last functions.
.Pp
The
.Fn libhammer_pfs_free_snapshots
function releases all the resources used to hold the information of the
snapshots for a particular PFS.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn libhammer_pfs_get_snapshots
returns 0 when successful and -1 in the case of failure.
The
.Vt errno
value indicating the error is stored within the passed
.Vt libhammer_pfsinfo_t
in the
.Vt libhammer_head
struct.
.Pp
.Fn libhammer_get_first_snap
and
.Fn libhammer_get_last_snap
must return a
.Vt libhammer_snapinfo_t
if the
.Fa pip
passed in is valid.
.Fn libhammer_get_next_snap
and
.Fn libhammer_get_prev_snap
return a
.Vt libhammer_snapinfo_t
or
.Dv NULL
in case there are no more elements.
