.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn calloc "size_t number" "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn realloc "void *ptr" "size_t size"
.Ft void *
.Fn reallocf "void *ptr" "size_t size"
.Ft void
.Fn free "void *ptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes of uninitialized memory.
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion)
for storage of any type of object.
If the space is at least
.Em pagesize
bytes in length (see
.Xr getpagesize 3 ) ,
the returned memory will be page boundary aligned as well.
.Pp
The
.Fn calloc
function allocates space for
.Fa number
objects,
each
.Fa size
bytes in length.
The result is identical to calling
.Fn malloc
with an argument of
.Dq "number * size" ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly initialized
to zero bytes.
.Pp
The
.Fn realloc
function changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
to
.Fa size
bytes.
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and
old sizes.
If the new size is larger,
the value of the newly allocated portion of the memory is undefined.
Upon success, the memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated memory is returned.
Note that
.Fn realloc
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value than
.Fa ptr .
If
.Fa ptr
is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fn realloc
function behaves identically to
.Fn malloc
for the specified size.
.Pp
The
.Fn reallocf
function call is identical to the realloc function call, except that it
will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be allocated.
This is a
.Fx
/
.Dx
specific API designed to ease the problems with traditional coding styles
for realloc causing memory leaks in libraries.
.Pp
The
.Fn free
function causes the allocated memory referenced by
.Fa ptr
to be made available for future allocations.
If
.Fa ptr
is
.Dv NULL ,
no action occurs.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Dx Ap s
.Nm
implementation is based on a port of the
.Dx
kernel slab allocator, appropriately modified for a user process
environment.
.Pp
The slab allocator breaks memory allocations up to 8KB into 80 zones.
Each zone represents a fixed allocation size in multiples of some
core chunking.
The chunking is a power-of-2 but the fixed allocation size is not.
For example, a 1025-byte request is allocated out of the zone with a
chunking of 128, thus in multiples of 1152 bytes.
The minimum chunking, used for allocations in the 0-127 byte range,
is 8 bytes (16 of the 80 zones).
Beyond that the power-of-2 chunking is between 1/8 and 1/16 of the
minimum allocation size for any given zone.
.Pp
As a special case any power-of-2-sized allocation within the zone
limit (8K) will be aligned to the same power-of-2 rather than that
zone's (smaller) chunking.
This is not something you can depend upon for
.Fn malloc ,
but it is used internally to optimize
.Xr posix_memalign 3 .
.Pp
Each zone reserves memory in 64KB blocks.
Actual memory use tends to be significantly less as only the pages
actually needed are faulted in.
Allocations larger than 8K are managed using
.Xr mmap 2
and tracked with a hash table.
.Pp
The zone mechanism results in well-fitted allocations with little
waste in a long-running environment which makes a lot of allocations.
Short-running environments which do not make many allocations will see
a bit of extra bloat due to the large number of zones but it will
be almost unnoticeable in the grand scheme of things.
To reduce bloat further the normal randomized start offset implemented
in the kernel version of the allocator to improve L1 cache fill is
disabled in the libc version.
.Pp
The zone mechanism also has the nice side effect of greatly reducing
fragmentation over the original
.Nm .
.Pp
.Fn calloc
is directly supported by keeping track of newly-allocated zones which
will be demand-zero'd by the system.
If the allocation is known to be zero'd we do not bother
.Fn bzero Ns ing
it.
If it is a reused allocation we
.Fn bzero .
.Pp
.Tn POSIX
threading is supported by duplicating the primary structure.
A thread entering
.Fn malloc
which is unable to immediately acquire a mutex on the last primary
structure it used will switch to a different primary structure.
At the moment this is more of a quick hack than a solution, but it works.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn calloc
functions return a pointer to the allocated memory if successful; otherwise
a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM .
.Pp
The
.Fn realloc
and
.Fn reallocf
functions return a pointer, possibly identical to
.Fa ptr ,
to the allocated memory
if successful; otherwise a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM
if the error was the result of an allocation failure.
The
.Fn realloc
function always leaves the original buffer intact
when an error occurs, whereas
.Fn reallocf
deallocates it in this case.
.Pp
The
.Fn free
function returns no value.
.Sh EXAMPLES
When using
.Fn malloc ,
be careful to avoid the following idiom:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if ((p = malloc(number * size)) == NULL)
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, "malloc");
.Ed
.Pp
The multiplication may lead to an integer overflow.
To avoid this,
.Fn calloc
is recommended.
.Pp
If
.Fn malloc
must be used, be sure to test for overflow:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if (size && number > SIZE_MAX / size) {
	errno = EOVERFLOW;
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, "allocation");
}
.Ed
.Pp
When using
.Fn realloc ,
one must be careful to avoid the following idiom:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nsize += 50;

if ((p = realloc(p, nsize)) == NULL)
	return NULL;
.Ed
.Pp
Do not adjust the variable describing how much memory has been allocated
until it is known that the allocation has been successful.
This can cause aberrant program behavior if the incorrect size value is used.
In most cases, the above example will also leak memory.
As stated earlier, a return value of
.Dv NULL
indicates that the old object still remains allocated.
Better code looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newsize = size + 50;

if ((p2 = realloc(p, newsize)) == NULL) {

	if (p != NULL)
		free(p);

	p = NULL;
	return NULL;
}

p = p2;
size = newsize;
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If
.Fn malloc ,
.Fn calloc ,
.Fn realloc
or
.Fn free
detect an error, a message will be printed to file descriptor
.Dv STDERR_FILENO
and the process will dump core.
