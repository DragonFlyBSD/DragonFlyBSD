.Sh NAME
.Nm dlerror
.Nd retrieve dynamic linker error messages
.Sh LIBRARY
This function is not in a library.
It is included in every dynamically linked program automatically.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dlfcn.h
.Ft char *
.Fn dlerror "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dlerror
function
returns a null-terminated character string describing the last error that
occurred during a call to
.Fn dlopen ,
.Fn dladdr ,
.Fn dlinfo ,
.Fn dlsym ,
.Fn dlvsym ,
or
.Fn dlclose .
If no such error has occurred,
.Fn dlerror
returns a null pointer.
At each call to
.Fn dlerror ,
the error indication is reset.
Thus in the case of two calls
to
.Fn dlerror ,
where the second call follows the first immediately, the second call
will always return a null pointer.
