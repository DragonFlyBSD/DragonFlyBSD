.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getdevpath
.Nd retrieve device path given name or label
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In fstab.h
.Ft char *
.Fn getdevpath "const char *devname" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getdevpath
takes a device name such as
.Dq Pa da0 ,
a device identifier such as
.Dq Li V21JYQ0G ,
a device path beginning with
.Dq Pa /
or
.Dq Pa \&. ,
or a device label from one of the
.Pa devtab
files, and returns an allocated path which may be used to open the device.
.Pp
Device names prefixed with
.Dq Pa /
or
.Dq Pa \&.
are assumed to be device paths and an exact allocated copy is simply returned.
However, flags may modify the operation.
.Pp
Device names specified with a type prefix, such as
.Dq Li serno:V21JYQ0G
are assumed to be typed device identifiers and are directly translated to
the appropriate path in
.Pa /dev ,
for example
.Dq Pa /dev/serno/V21JYQ0G .
.Pp
Device labels are directly checked against
.Pa /dev
first, using
.Fn lstat ,
and if not found will be searched for in one of the
.Pa devtab
files.
.Pp
The following flags may be passed to
.Fn getdevpath :
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv GETDEVPATH_RAWDEV" -offset indent
.It Dv GETDEVPATH_RAWDEV
Normally,
.Fn getdevpath
returns a high level devfs path which often winds up being a softlink in
devfs.
If this flag is specified and the device path represents a softlink,
.Fn getdevpath
will do a
.Xr readlink 2
and return the actual raw device path instead.
If the device path cannot be
.Fn lstat Ap d
this option will return
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn getdevpath
returns a pointer to a
.Fn malloc Ap d
path on success and
.Dv NULL
on failure.
If a failure occurs
.Va errno
will be set appropriately.
.Pp
Note that a
.Fn malloc Ap d
path may be returned even if it does not exist in the filesystem.
Callers should not assume that the device is accessible
unless they can also open the device.
