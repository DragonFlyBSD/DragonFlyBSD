.Dt TZSET 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tzset ,
.Nm tzsetwall
.Nd initialize time conversion information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft void
.Fn tzset void
.Ft void
.Fn tzsetwall void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tzset
function
initializes time conversion information used by the library routine
.Xr localtime 3 .
The environment variable
.Ev TZ
specifies how this is done.
.Pp
If
.Ev TZ
does not appear in the environment, the best available approximation to
local wall clock time, as specified by the
.Xr tzfile 5 Ns -format
file
.Pa /etc/localtime
is used.
.Pp
If
.Ev TZ
appears in the environment but its value is a null string
Universal Time
.Pq UT
is used, with the abbreviation
.Dq UTC
and without leap second correction; please see
.Xr ctime 3
for more about UT, UTC, and leap seconds.
.Pp
If
.Ev TZ
appears in the environment and its value begins with a colon
.Pq Ql \&: ,
the rest of its value is used as a pathname of a
.Xr tzfile 5 Ns -format
file from which to read the time conversion information.
If the first character of the pathname is a slash
.Pq Ql /
it is used as
an absolute pathname; otherwise, it is used as a pathname relative to
the system time conversion information directory.
.Pp
If its value does not begin with a colon, it is first used as the pathname
of a file (as described above) from which to read the time conversion
information.
If that file cannot be read, the value is then interpreted as a direct
specification (the format is described below) of the time conversion
information.
.Pp
If the
.Ev TZ
environment variable does not specify a
.Xr tzfile 5 Ns -format
file and cannot be interpreted as a direct specification,
.Tn UTC
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fn tzsetwall
function
sets things up so that
.Xr localtime 3
returns the best available approximation of local wall clock time.
.Sh SPECIFICATION FORMAT
When
.Ev TZ
is used directly as a specification of the time conversion information,
it must have the following syntax (spaces inserted for clarity):
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Em std offset
.Bo
.Em dst
.Bq Em offset
.Bq , Em rule
.Bc
.Ed
.Pp
Where:
.Bl -tag -width std_and_dst -offset indent
.It Em std No and Em dst
Three or more bytes that are the designation for the standard
.Pq Em std
or summer
.Pq Em dst
time zone.  Only
.Em std
is required; if
.Em dst
is missing, then summer time does not apply in this locale.
Upper and lowercase letters are explicitly allowed.  Any characters
except a leading colon
.Pq Ql \&: ,
digits, comma
.Pq Ql \&, ,
minus
.Pq Ql \- ,
plus
.Pq Ql + ,
and
.Tn ASCII
.Dv NUL
are allowed.
.It Em offset
Indicates the value one must add to the local time to arrive at
Coordinated Universal Time.  The
.Em offset
has the form:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sm off
.Em hh Bo
.Em : mm
.Bq Em : ss
.Bc
.Sm on
.Ed
.Pp
The minutes
.Pq Em mm
and seconds
.Pq Em ss
are optional.  The hour
.Pq Em hh
is required and may be a single digit.  The
.Em offset
following
.Em std
is required.  If no
.Em offset
follows
.Em dst ,
summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.  One or
more digits may be used; the value is always interpreted as a decimal
number.  The hour must be between zero and 24, and the minutes (and
seconds) \(em if present \(em between zero and 59.  If preceded by a
.Pq Ql \-
the time zone shall be east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise it shall be
west (which may be indicated by an optional preceding
.Pq Ql + ) .
.It Em rule
Indicates when to change to and back from summer time.  The
.Em rule
has the form:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Em date/time,date/time
.Ed
.Pp
where the first
.Em date
describes when the change from standard to summer time occurs and the
second
.Em date
describes when the change back happens.  Each
.Em time
field describes when, in current local time, the change to the other
time is made.
As an extension to POSIX, daylight saving is assumed to be in effect
all year if it begins January 1 at 00:00 and ends December 31 at
24:00 plus the difference between daylight saving and standard time,
leaving no room for standard time in the calendar.
.Pp
The format of
.Em date
is one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "M.m.n.d"
.It Sy J Em n
The Julian day
.Em n
(1 \*(Le
.Em n
\*(Le 365).
Leap days are not counted; that is, in all years \(em including leap
years \(em February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60.  It is
impossible to explicitly refer to the occasional February 29.
.It Em n
The zero-based Julian day
(0 \*(Le
.Em n
\*(Le 365 ) .
Leap days are counted, and it is possible to refer to February 29.
.It Sy M  Em m.n.d
The
.Em d Ns 'th
day (0 \*(Le
.Em d
\*(Le 6)
of week
.Em n
of month
.Em m
of the year
(1 \*(Le
.Em n
\*(Le 5),
(1 \*(Le
.Em m
\*(Le 12),
where week 5 means
.Do
the last
.Em d
day in month
.Em m
.Dc
which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth week).  Week 1 is the
first week in which the
.Em d Ns 'th
day occurs.  Day zero is Sunday.
.El
.Pp
The
.Em time
has the same format as
.Em offset
except that POSIX does not allow a leading sign
.Pq Ql \-
or
.Pq Ql + .
As an extension to POSIX, the hours part of
.Em time
can range from -167 through 167; this allows for unusual rules such
as
.Dq the Saturday before the first Sunday of March .
The default, if
.Em time
is not given, is
.Sy 02:00:00 .
.El
.Pp
Here are some examples of
.Ev TZ
values that directly specify the time zone rules; they use some of the
extensions to POSIX.
.Bl -tag -width ".Sy EST5X"
.It Sy EST5
stands for US Eastern Standard
Time (EST), 5 hours behind UTC, without daylight saving.
.It Sy FJT-12FJST,M10.3.1/146,M1.3.4/75
stands for Fiji Time (FJT) and Fiji Summer Time (FJST), 12 hours ahead
of UTC, springing forward on October's third Monday at
146:00 (i.e., 02:00 on the first Sunday on or after October 21), and
falling back on January's third Thursday at 75:00 (i.e., 03:00 on the
first Sunday on or after January 18).
.It Sy IST-2IDT,M3.4.4/26,M10.5.0
stands for Israel Standard Time (IST) and Israel Daylight Time (IDT),
2 hours ahead of UTC, springing forward on March's fourth
Tuesday at 26:00 (i.e., 02:00 on the first Friday on or after March
23), and falling back on October's last Sunday at 02:00.
.It Sy WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25
stands for Western Argentina Summer Time (WARST), 3 hours behind UTC.
There is a dummy fall-back transition on December 31 at 25:00 daylight
saving time (i.e., 24:00 standard time, equivalent to January 1 at
00:00 standard time), and a simultaneous spring-forward transition on
January 1 at 00:00 standard time, so daylight saving time is in effect
all year and the initial
.Sy WART
is a placeholder.
.It Sy WGT3WGST,M3.5.0/-2,M10.5.0/-1
stands for Western Greenland Time (WGT) and Western Greenland Summer
Time (WGST), 3 hours behind UTC, where clocks follow the EU rules of
springing forward on March's last Sunday at 01:00 UTC (\(mi02:00 local
time) and falling back on October's last Sunday at 01:00 UTC
(-01:00 local time).
.El
.Pp
If no
.Em rule
is present in the
.Ev TZ
specification, the rules specified
by the
.Xr tzfile 5 Ns -format
file
.Em posixrules
in the system time conversion information directory are used, with the
standard and summer time offsets from
.Tn UTC
replaced by those specified by
the
.Em offset
values in
.Ev TZ .
.Pp
For compatibility with System V Release 3.1, a semicolon
.Pq Ql \&;
may be used to separate the
.Em rule
from the rest of the specification.
