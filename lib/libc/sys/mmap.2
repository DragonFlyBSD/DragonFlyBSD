.Dt MMAP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mmap
.Nd allocate memory, or map files or devices into memory
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/mman.h
.Ft void *
.Fn mmap "void *addr" "size_t len" "int prot" "int flags" "int fd" "off_t offset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mmap
function causes the pages starting at
.Fa addr
and continuing for at most
.Fa len
bytes to be mapped from the object described by
.Fa fd ,
starting at byte offset
.Fa offset .
If
.Fa len
is not a multiple of the pagesize, the mapped region may extend past the
specified range.
Any such extension beyond the end of the mapped object will be zero-filled.
.Pp
If
.Fa addr
is non-zero, it is used as a hint to the system.
(As a convenience to the system, the actual address of the region may differ
from the address supplied.)
If
.Fa addr
is zero, an address will be selected by the system.
The actual starting address of the region is returned.
A successful
.Fa mmap
deletes any previous mapping in the allocated address range.
.Pp
The protections (region accessibility) are specified in the
.Fa prot
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PROT_WRITE" -compact
.It Dv PROT_NONE
Pages may not be accessed.
.It Dv PROT_READ
Pages may be read.
.It Dv PROT_WRITE
Pages may be written.
.It Dv PROT_EXEC
Pages may be executed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
parameter specifies the type of the mapped object, mapping options and
whether modifications made to the mapped copy of the page are private
to the process or are to be shared with other references.
Sharing, mapping type and options are specified in the
.Fa flags
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv MAP_HASSEMAPHORE"
.It Dv MAP_ANON
Map anonymous memory not associated with any specific file.
The file descriptor used for creating
.Dv MAP_ANON
must be \-1.
The
.Fa offset
parameter is ignored.
.It Dv MAP_ANONYMOUS
This flag is an alias for
.Dv MAP_ANON
and is provided for compatibility.
.\".It Dv MAP_FILE
.\"Mapped from a regular file or character-special device memory.
.It Dv MAP_FIXED
Do not permit the system to select a different address than the one
specified.
If the specified address contains other mappings those mappings will
be replaced.
If the specified address cannot otherwise be used,
.Fn mmap
will fail.
If
.Dv MAP_FIXED
is specified,
.Fa addr
must be a multiple of the pagesize.
.It Dv MAP_TRYFIXED
Try to do a fixed mapping but fail if another mapping already exists in
the space instead of overwriting the mapping.
.Pp
When used with
.Dv MAP_STACK
This flag creates a grow-down stack area with the specified maximum
stack size.
It is no longer special-cased and will be converted to a normal anonymous
.Fn mmap ,
meaning that other
.Fn mmap
calls cannot sub-map ungrown areas returned by prior
.Dv MAP_STACK
maps using
.Dv MAP_TRYFIXED .
The entire area is now applicable to the mapping.
.Pp
Note that the kernel itself can still create auto-grow areas but will
do so for the user stack in order to maintain backwards compatibility
with older code that might otherwise assume it can map below the user
stack (in particular, older pthread libraries).
This compatibility is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
.It Dv MAP_HASSEMAPHORE
Notify the kernel that the region may contain semaphores and that special
handling may be necessary.
.It Dv MAP_NOCORE
Region is not included in a core file.
.It Dv MAP_NOSYNC
Causes data dirtied via this VM map to be flushed to physical media
only when necessary (usually by the pager) rather than gratuitously.
Typically this prevents the update daemons from flushing pages dirtied
through such maps and thus allows efficient sharing of memory across
unassociated processes using a file-backed shared memory map.
Without
this option any VM pages you dirty may be flushed to disk every so often
(every 30-60 seconds usually) which can create performance problems if you
do not need that to occur (such as when you are using shared file-backed
mmap regions for IPC purposes).
Note that VM/filesystem coherency is maintained whether you use
.Dv MAP_NOSYNC
or not.
This option is not portable across
.Ux
platforms (yet), though some may implement the same behavior
by default.
.Pp
.Em WARNING !
Extending a file with
.Xr ftruncate 2 ,
thus creating a big hole, and then filling the hole by modifying a shared
.Fn mmap
can lead to severe file fragmentation.
In order to avoid such fragmentation you should always pre-allocate the
file's backing store by
.Fn write Ns ing
zero's into the newly extended area prior to modifying the area via your
.Fn mmap .
The fragmentation problem is especially sensitive to
.Dv MAP_NOSYNC
pages, because pages may be flushed to disk in a totally random order.
.Pp
The same applies when using
.Dv MAP_NOSYNC
to implement a file-based shared memory store.
It is recommended that you create the backing store by
.Fn write Ns ing
zero's to the backing file rather than
.Fn ftruncate Ns ing
it.
You can test file fragmentation by observing the KB/t (kilobytes per
transfer) results from an
.Dq Li iostat 1
while reading a large file sequentially, e.g.,\& using
.Dq Li dd if=filename of=/dev/null bs=32k .
.Pp
The
.Xr fsync 2
function will flush all dirty data and metadata associated with a file,
including dirty NOSYNC VM data, to physical media.
The
.Xr sync 8
command and
.Xr sync 2
system call generally do not flush dirty NOSYNC VM data.
The
.Xr msync 2
system call is obsolete since
.Bx
implements a coherent filesystem buffer cache.
However, it may be
used to associate dirty VM pages with filesystem buffers and thus cause
them to be flushed to physical media sooner rather than later.
.It Dv MAP_PRIVATE
Modifications are private.
.It Dv MAP_SHARED
Modifications are shared.
.It Dv MAP_STACK
Map the area as a stack.
.Dv MAP_ANON
is implied.
.Fa Offset
should be 0,
.Fa fd
must be -1, and
.Fa prot
should include at least
.Dv PROT_READ
and
.Dv PROT_WRITE .
This option creates
a memory region that grows to at most
.Fa len
bytes in size, starting from the stack top and growing down.
The stack top is the starting address returned by the call, plus
.Fa len
bytes.
The bottom of the stack at maximum growth is the starting
address returned by the call.
.Pp
The entire area is reserved from the point of view of other
.Fn mmap
calls, even if not faulted in yet.
.Pp
Note that unless
.Dv MAP_FIXED
or
.Dv MAP_TRYFIXED
is used, you cannot count on the returned address matching the hint
you have provided.
.It Dv MAP_32BIT
When specified,
.Fn mmap
will allocate memory in the first 4GB of the address space, even if this
memory is inside the datasize resource limit (which is usually reserved).
When not specified, address hints are adjusted upward to at least the first
address above the datasize resource limit... usually above the 32GB mark
in the address space.
.It Dv MAP_VPAGETABLE
Memory accessed via this map is not linearly mapped and will be governed
by a virtual page table.
The base address of the virtual page table may be set using
.Xr mcontrol 2
with
.Dv MADV_SETMAP .
Virtual page tables work with anonymous memory but there
is no way to populate the page table so for all intents and purposes
.Dv MAP_VPAGETABLE
can only be used when mapping file descriptors.
Since the kernel will update the
.Dv VPTE_M
bit in the virtual page table, the mapping must R+W
even though actual access to the memory will be properly governed by
the virtual page table.
.Pp
Addressable backing store is limited by the range supported in the virtual
page table entries.
The kernel may implement a page table abstraction capable
of addressing a larger range within the backing store then could otherwise
be mapped into memory.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr close 2
function does not unmap pages, see
.Xr munmap 2
for further information.
.Pp
The current design does not allow a process to specify the location of
swap space.
In the future we may define an additional mapping type,
.Dv MAP_SWAP ,
in which
the file descriptor argument specifies a file or device to which swapping
should be done.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn mmap
returns a pointer to the mapped region.
Otherwise, a value of
.Dv MAP_FAILED
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
