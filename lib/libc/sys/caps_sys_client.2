.Sh DESCRIPTION
Create an IPC client connected to the service specified by the
.Fa name
argument.
Either
.Fa uid
or
.Fa gid
can be -1 (thereby indicating a wildcard),
but not both.
Programs connecting to a
.Em generic
service typically first try
.Fn getuid
and -1, then try -1 and
.Fn getgid ,
then try 0 and 0.
The
.Fa upcid
argument can either be an upcall or a kqueue identifier.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, this function returns a port identifier.
On failure, -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
This function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP"
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The CAPS system has not been enabled with
.Va kern.caps_enabled .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid argument was specified.
