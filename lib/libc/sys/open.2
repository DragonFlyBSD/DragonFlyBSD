.Sh NAME
.Nm open , openat
.Nd open or create a file for reading or writing
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn open "const char *path" "int flags" "..."
.Ft int
.Fn openat "int fd" "const char *path" "int flags" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file name specified by
.Fa path
is opened
for reading and/or writing as specified by the
argument
.Fa flags
and the lowest unused file descriptor in the process' file descriptor table
is returned.
The
.Fa flags
argument may indicate the file is to be
created if it does not exist (by specifying the
.Dv O_CREAT
flag).
In this case
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
require a third argument
.Fa "mode_t mode" ,
and the file is created with mode
.Fa mode
as described in
.Xr chmod 2
and modified by the process' umask value (see
.Xr umask 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn openat
function is equivalent to the
.Fn open
function except in the case where the
.Fa path
specifies a relative path.
In this case the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory
associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
The
.Fa flag
parameter and the optional fourth parameter correspond exactly to
the parameters of
.Fn open .
If
.Fn openat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the current working directory is used
and the behavior is identical to a call to
.Fn open .
.Pp
The flags specified are formed by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
O_RDONLY	open for reading only
O_WRONLY	open for writing only
O_RDWR		open for reading and writing
O_NONBLOCK	do not block on open
O_APPEND	append on each write
O_CREAT		create file if it does not exist
O_TRUNC		truncate size to 0
O_EXCL		error if create and file exists
O_SHLOCK	atomically obtain a shared lock
O_EXLOCK	atomically obtain an exclusive lock
O_DIRECT	eliminate or reduce cache effects
O_FSYNC		synchronous writes
O_NOFOLLOW	do not follow symlinks
O_DIRECTORY	error if file is not a directory
O_CLOEXEC	set FD_CLOEXEC upon open
O_CLOFORK	set FD_CLOFORK upon open
.Ed
.Pp
Opening a file with
.Dv O_APPEND
set causes each write on the file
to be appended to the end.
If
.Dv O_TRUNC
is specified and the
file exists, the file is truncated to zero length.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set with
.Dv O_CREAT
and the file already
exists,
.Fn open
returns an error.
This may be used to
implement a simple exclusive access locking mechanism.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set and the last component of the pathname is
a symbolic link,
.Fn open
will fail even if the symbolic
link points to a non-existent name.
If the
.Dv O_NONBLOCK
flag is specified and the
.Fn open
call would result
in the process being blocked for some reason (e.g., waiting for
carrier on a dialup line),
.Fn open
returns immediately.
The first time the process attempts to perform I/O on the open
file it will block (not currently implemented).
.Pp
If
.Dv O_FSYNC
is used in the mask, all writes will
immediately be written to disk,
the kernel will not cache written data
and all writes on the descriptor will not return until
the data to be written completes.
.Pp
If
.Dv O_NOFOLLOW
is used in the mask and the target file passed to
.Fn open
is a symbolic link then the
.Fn open
will fail.
.Pp
When opening a file, a lock with
.Xr flock 2
semantics can be obtained by setting
.Dv O_SHLOCK
for a shared lock, or
.Dv O_EXLOCK
for an exclusive lock.
If creating a file with
.Dv O_CREAT ,
the request for the lock will never fail
(provided that the underlying filesystem supports locking).
.Pp
.Dv O_DIRECT
may be used to minimize or eliminate the cache effects of reading and writing.
The system will attempt to avoid caching the data you read or write.
If it cannot avoid caching the data,
it will minimize the impact the data has on the cache.
Use of this flag can drastically reduce performance if not used with care.
.Pp
.Dv O_DIRECTORY
may be used to ensure the resulting file descriptor refers to a directory.
This flag can be used to prevent applications with elevated privileges
from opening files which are even unsafe to open with
.Dv O_RDONLY ,
such as device nodes.
.Pp
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
may be used to atomically set the
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
flag for the newly returned file descriptor.
.Pp
.Dv O_CLOFORK
may be used to atomically set the
.Dv FD_CLOFORK
flag for the newly returned file descriptor.
The file will be closed on any child process created with
.Fn fork 2
or
.Fn vfork 2
.Pp
If successful,
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
return a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns -1 on failure.
The file pointer used to mark the current position within the
file is set to the beginning of the file.
.Pp
When a new file is created it is given the group of the directory
which contains it.
.Pp
Unless
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
was specified, the new descriptor is set to remain open across
.Xr execve 2
system calls; see
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr fcntl 2
and
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
description.
.Pp
The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors
open simultaneously by one process.
.Xr Getdtablesize 2
returns the current system limit.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
return a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
They return -1 on failure, and set
.Va errno
to indicate the error.

.Sh HISTORY
An
.Fn open
function call appeared in
.At v6 .
An
.Fn openat
function call appeared first in Solaris and was ported to
.Dx 2.3 .
.Dv O_CLOFORK
appeared in
.Fx 15.0
and
.Dx 6.5 .
.Sh BUGS
The Open Group Extended API Set 2 specification requires that the test
for
.Fa fd Ap s
searchability is based on whether it is open for searching,
and not whether the underlying directory currently permits searches.
The present implementation of
.Fn openat
checks the current permissions of directory instead.
