.Nm wcsftime ,
.Nm wcsftime_l
.Nd "convert date and time to a wide-character string"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft size_t
.Fo wcsftime
.Fa "wchar_t * restrict wcs" "size_t maxsize"
.Fa "const wchar_t * restrict format" "const struct tm * restrict timeptr"

.In xlocale.h
.Ft size_t
.Fo wcsftime_l
.Fa "wchar_t * restrict wcs" "size_t maxsize"
.Fa "const wchar_t * restrict format" "const struct tm * restrict timeptr"
.Fa "locale_t locale"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcsftime
and
.Fn wcsftime_l
functions are equivalent to the
.Fn strftime
and
.Fn strftime_l
functions except for the types of their arguments.
Refer to
.Xr strftime 3
for a detailed description.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcsftime_l
function takes an explicit
.Fa locale
argument, whereas the
.Fn wcsftime
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Some early implementations of
.Fn wcsftime
had a
.Fa format
argument with type
.Vt "const char *"
instead of
.Vt "const wchar_t *" .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr strftime 3 ,
.Xr xlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcsftime
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
