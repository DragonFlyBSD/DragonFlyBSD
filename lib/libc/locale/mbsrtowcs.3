.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs
and
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l
functions convert a sequence of multibyte characters pointed to indirectly by
.Fa src
into a sequence of corresponding wide characters and store at most
.Fa len
of them in the
.Vt wchar_t
array pointed to by
.Fa dst ,
until they encounter a terminating null character
.Pq Li '\e0' .
.Pp
If
.Fa dst
is
.Dv NULL ,
no characters are stored.
.Pp
If
.Fa dst
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the pointer pointed to by
.Fa src
is updated to point to the character after the one that conversion stopped at.
If conversion stops because a null character is encountered,
.Fa *src
is set to
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Vt mbstate_t
argument,
.Fa ps ,
is used to keep track of the shift state.
If it is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn mbsrtowcs
and
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l
use an internal, static
.Vt mbstate_t
object, which is initialized to the initial conversion state
at program startup.
.Pp
The
.Fn mbsnrtowcs
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs_l
functions behave identically to
.Fn mbsrtowcs
and
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l ,
except that conversion stops after reading at most
.Fa nms
bytes from the buffer pointed to by
.Fa src .
.Pp
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs_l
functions take an explicit
.Fa locale
argument, whereas the
.Fn mbsrtowcs
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs
functions use the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs ,
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l ,
.Fn mbsnrtowcs ,
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs_l
functions return the number of wide characters stored in
the array pointed to by
.Fa dst
if successful, otherwise they return
.Po Vt size_t Pc Ns \-1 .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs ,
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l ,
.Fn mbsnrtowcs ,
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs_l
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid multibyte character sequence was encountered.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The conversion state is invalid.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Pp
The
.Fn mbsrtowcs_l ,
.Fn mbsnrtowcs ,
and
.Fn mbsnrtowcs_l
functions are an extension to the standard.
