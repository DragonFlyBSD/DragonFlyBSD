.SH NAME
cproj, cprojf, cprojl \- complex projection functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <complex.h>

.sp
double complex cproj(double complex\fP \fIz\fP\fB);

float complex cprojf(float complex\fP \fIz\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions compute a projection of \fIz\fP onto the Riemann
sphere: \fIz\fP projects to \fIz\fP, except that all
complex infinities (even those with one infinite part and one NaN
part) project to positive infinity on the real axis. If \fIz\fP
has an infinite part, then \fIcproj\fP( \fIz\fP) shall be equivalent
to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBINFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))
\fP
.fi

.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
These functions return the value of the projection onto the
Riemann sphere.
.SH ERRORS

.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Two topologies are commonly used in complex mathematics: the complex
plane with its continuum of infinities, and the Riemann
sphere with its single infinity. The complex plane is better suited
for transcendental functions, the Riemann sphere for algebraic
functions. The complex types with their multiplicity of infinities
provide a useful (though imperfect) model for the complex plane.
The \fIcproj\fP() function helps model the Riemann sphere by mapping
all infinities to one, and should be used just before any
operation, especially comparisons, that might give spurious results
for any of the other infinities. Note that a complex value with
one infinite part and one NaN part is regarded as an infinity, not
a NaN, because if one part is infinite, the complex value is
infinite independent of the value of the other part. For the same
reason, \fIcabs\fP()
returns an infinity if its argument has an infinite part and a NaN
part.
