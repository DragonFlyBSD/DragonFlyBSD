.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_hammer2
.Nd construct a new HAMMER2 file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl L Ar label
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl b Ar bootsize
.Op Fl r Ar redosize
.Op Fl V Ar version
.Op Fl R Ar uuid
.Op Fl I Ar uuid
.Ar special ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a
.Nm HAMMER2
file system on device(s)
.Ar special .
If multiple devices are specified a single
.Nm HAMMER2
file system is created
which spans all of them.
Each
.Ar special
will constitute a volume which the
.Nm HAMMER2
file system is built on.
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are sector-size agnostic, however the
.Dx
implementation requires the sector size to be no larger than 16K.
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems start at a relative offset of 0 and may only be created
under out-of-band disk labels
.Po
.Xr disklabel64 5
or
.Xr gpt 8
labels
.Pc ,
or in
.Xr disklabel32 5
partitions which do not overlap the label area (have a starting sector
greater than 16).
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems are designed for large storage systems, up to 1 Exabyte, and
will not operate efficiently on small storage systems.
The minimum recommended file system size is 50GB.
.Nm HAMMER2
must reserve 500MB to 1GB of its storage for reblocking and UNDO/REDO.
In addition,
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems operating normally, with full history
retention and daily snapshots, do not immediately reclaim space when
files are deleted.
A regular system maintenance job runs once a day by
.Xr periodic 8
to handle reclamation.
.Pp
.Nm HAMMER2
works best when the machine's normal workload would not otherwise fill
the file system up in the course of 60 days of operation.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L Ar label
All
.Nm HAMMER2
file systems must be named and names should be unique on a
per-machine basis.
.It Fl b Ar bootsize
Specify a fixed area in which a boot related kernel and data can be stored.
The
.Ar bootsize
is specified in bytes.
By default a boot area of approximately 4MB will be created.
.It Fl f
Force operation.
This is needed for the creation of a
.Nm HAMMER2
file system less than 10GB size or
with less than 500MB UNDO/REDO FIFO.
This should not be used under normal circumstances.
.It Fl r Ar redosize
Specify the size of the fixed REDO FIFO.
The
.Ar redosize
is specified in bytes.
By default 0.1% of the root
volume's size is used, with a reasonable minimum and a reasonable cap.
The UNDO/REDO FIFO is used to sequence meta-data out to the media for
instant crash recovery.
.It Fl V Ar version
Specify the
.Nm HAMMER2
file system version to format.
By default
.Nm
formats the file system using the highest production version number
supported by the
.Nm HAMMER2
VFS by checking the
.Va vfs.hammer2.supported_version
sysctl.
If you need to maintain compatibility with an older version of
.Nm HAMMER2
you may specify the version with this option.
.It Fl R Ar uuid
Specify the super-root cluster id.
Use this option to set-up whole-media mirrors with the same super-root
cluster id.
If not specified, a random uuid is generated.
.It Fl I Ar uuid
Specify the cluster id for the initial mount point label.
Use this option to set-up PFS mirrors with the same cluster id.
If not specified, a random uuid is generated.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar bootsize
and
.Ar redosize
must be given with a suffix of
.Cm K , M , G
or
.Cm T
meaning kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte.
Lower case can also be used for suffix.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_hammer2 -L Home /dev/ad0s1d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a file system named
.Sq Home
on
.Pa /dev/ad0s1d .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on error.
