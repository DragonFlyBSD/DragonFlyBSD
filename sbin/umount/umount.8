.Sh NAME
.Nm umount
.Nd unmount filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfv
.Ar special \&| node
.Nm
.Fl a | A
.Op Fl F Ar fstab
.Op Fl dfv
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command
calls the
.Xr unmount 2
system call to remove a
.Ar "special device"
or the remote node (rhost:path) from the filesystem tree at the point
.Ar node .
If either
.Ar special
or
.Ar node
are not provided, the appropriate information is taken from the
.Xr fstab 5
file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
All the filesystems described in
.Xr fstab 5
are unmounted.
.It Fl A
All the currently mounted filesystems except
the root are unmounted.
.It Fl d
If the filesystem is mounted on a memory disk (see
.Xr vn 4) , detach it after unmount(2).
.It Fl F Ar fstab
Specify the
.Pa fstab
file to use.
.It Fl f
The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.
Active special devices continue to work,
but all other files return errors if further accesses are attempted.
The root filesystem cannot be forcibly unmounted.
.It Fl h Ar host
Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be
unmounted.
This option implies the
.Fl A
option and, unless otherwise specified with the
.Fl t
option, will only unmount
.Tn NFS
filesystems.
.It Fl t Ar type
Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on
filesystems of the specified type.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
For example, the
.Nm
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
umount -a -t nfs,mfs
.Ed
.Pp
unmounts all filesystems of the type
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MFS
that are listed in the
.Xr fstab 5
file.
.It Fl v
Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem
is unmounted.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PATH_FSTAB
.It Pa PATH_FSTAB
If the environment variable
.Pa PATH_FSTAB
is set all operations are performed against the specified file.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/fstab -compact
