.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
installs, examines or modifies a 64 bit label on a disk drive or pack.
When writing
the label, it can be used to change the drive identification, the disk
partitions on the drive, or to replace a damaged label.
There are several forms
of the command that read (display), install or edit the label on a disk.
In
addition,
.Nm
can install bootstrap code.
.Ss Raw or in-core label
The disk label resides close to or at the beginning of each disk slice.
For faster access, the kernel maintains a copy in core at all times.
By
default, most forms of the
.Nm
command access the in-core copy of the label.
To access the raw (on-disk)
copy, use the
.Fl r
option.
This option allows a label to be installed on a disk without kernel
support for a label, such as when labels are first installed on a system; it
must be used when first installing a label on a disk.
The specific effect of
.Fl r
is described under each command.
.Ss Disk device name
All
.Nm
forms require a disk device name, which should always be the raw
device name representing the disk or slice.
.Dx
uses the following scheme for slice numbering:
If the disk doesn't use GPT (typically laid out by
.Xr gpt 8 ) ,
but e.g.\& MBR (typically laid out by
.Xr fdisk 8 ) ,
then slice 0, e.g.\&
.Pa da0s0 ,
represents the entire disk regardless of any DOS partitioning.
Slice 0 is called the compatibility slice,
and slice 1 and onward, e.g.\&
.Pa da0s1 ,
represents a
.Bx
slice.
If the disk does use GPT, then all slices are
.Bx
slices, slice 0 isn't special, it is just the first slice on the disk.
You do not have to include the
.Pa /dev/
path prefix when specifying the device.
The
.Nm
utility will automatically prepend it.
.Ss Reading the disk label
To examine the label on a disk drive, use
.Nm
without options:
.Pp
.Nm
.Op Fl r
.Ar disk
.Pp
.Ar disk
represents the raw disk in question, and may be in the form
.Pa da0s1
or
.Pa /dev/da0s1 .
It will display all of the parameters associated with the drive and its
partition layout.
Unless the
.Fl r
flag is given,
the kernel's in-core copy of the label is displayed;
if the disk has no label, or the partition types on the disk are incorrect,
the kernel may have constructed or modified the label.
If the
.Fl r
flag is given,
.Nm
reads the label from the raw disk and displays it.
Both versions are usually
identical except in the case where a label has not yet been initialized or
is corrupt.
.Ss Writing a standard label
To write a standard label, use the form
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl w
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl n
.Ar disk
.Op Ar disktype Ns / Ns Cm auto Op Ar packid
.Pp
The required argument to
.Nm
is the drive to be labeled.
The first optional argument is the drive type as described in the
.Xr disktab 5
file, from which the drive parameters and partitions are taken.
If not specified, then the
.Cm auto
type is assumed to make a virgin label for the disk as described below.
If
different disks of the same physical type are to have different partitions, it
will be necessary to have separate disktab entries describing each, or to edit
the label after installation as described below.
The optional argument is a
pack identification string, up to 63 characters long.
The pack id must be
quoted if it contains blanks.
.Pp
If the
.Fl n
flag is given, no data will be written to the device, and instead the
disklabel that would have been written will be printed to stdout.
.Pp
If the
.Fl r
flag is given, the disk sectors containing the label and bootstrap
will be written directly.
A side-effect of this is that any existing bootstrap code will be overwritten
and the disk rendered unbootable.
See the boot options below for a method of
writing the label and the bootstrap at the same time.
If
.Fl r
is not specified,
the existing label will be updated via the in-core copy and any bootstrap
code will be unaffected.
If the disk does not already have a label, the
.Fl r
flag must be used.
In either case, the kernel's in-core label is replaced.
.Pp
For a virgin disk that is not known to
.Xr disktab 5 ,
.Ar disktype
can be specified as
.Cm auto .
In this case, the driver is requested to produce a virgin label for the
disk.
This might or might not be successful, depending on whether the
driver for the disk is able to get the required data without reading
anything from the disk at all.
It will likely succeed for all SCSI
disks, most IDE disks, and vnode devices.
Writing a label to the
disk is the only supported operation.
.Pp
For most harddisks, a label based on percentages for most partitions (and
one partition with a size of
.Ql * )
will produce a reasonable configuration.
.Pp
PC-based systems have special requirements in order for the BIOS to properly
recognize a
.Dx
disklabel.
Older systems may require what is known as a
.Dq dangerously dedicated
disklabel, which creates a fake DOS partition to work around problems older
BIOSes have with modern disk geometries.
On newer systems you generally want
to create a normal DOS partition using
.Ar fdisk
and then create a
.Dx
disklabel within that slice.
This is described
later on in this page.
.Pp
Installing a new disklabel does not in of itself allow your system to boot
a kernel using that label.
You must also install boot blocks, which is
described later on in this manual page.
.Ss Editing an existing disk label
To edit an existing disk label, use the form
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl e
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl n
.Ar disk
.Pp
This command reads the label from the in-core kernel copy, or directly from the
disk if the
.Fl r
flag is also specified.
The label is written to a file in ASCII and then
supplied to an editor for changes.
If no editor is specified in an
.Ev EDITOR
environment variable,
.Xr vi 1
is used.
When the editor terminates, the label file is used to rewrite the disk label.
Existing bootstrap code is unchanged regardless of whether
.Fl r
was specified.
If
.Fl n
is specified, no data will be written to the device, and instead the
disklabel that would have been written will be printed to stdout.
This is
useful to see how a partitioning scheme will work out for a specific disk.
.Ss Restoring a disk label from a file
To restore a disk label from a file, use the form
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl R
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl n
.Ar disk Ar protofile
.Pp
.Nm
is capable of restoring a disk label that was previously saved in a file
in ASCII format.
The prototype file used to create the label should be in the same format
as that produced when reading or editing a label.
Comments are delimited by
.Ql #
and newline.
As when writing a new label, any existing bootstrap code will be
clobbered if
.Fl r
is specified and will be unaffected otherwise.
See the boot options below for a
method of restoring the label and writing the bootstrap at the same time.
If
.Fl n
is used, no data will be written to the device, and instead the
disklabel that would have been written will be printed to stdout.
This is
useful to see how a partitioning scheme will work out for a specific disk.
.Ss Enabling and disabling writing to the disk label area
By default, it is not possible to write to the disk label area at the beginning
of a disk.
The disk driver arranges for
.Xr write 2
and similar system calls
to return
.Er EROFS
on any attempt to do so.
If you need
to write to this area (for example, to obliterate the label), use the form
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl W
.Ar disk
.Pp
To disallow writing to the label area after previously allowing it,
use the command
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl N
.Ar disk
.Ss Installing bootstraps
The final three forms of
.Nm
are used to install bootstrap code, which allows boot from a
.Xr HAMMER 5 ,
.Xr HAMMER2 5 ,
or
.Xr UFS 5
file system.
If you are creating a
.Dq dangerously-dedicated
slice for compatibility with older PC systems,
you generally want to specify the compatibility slice, such as
.Pa da0s0 .
If you are creating a label within an existing DOS slice,
you should specify
the slice name such as
.Pa da0s1 .
Making a slice bootable can be tricky.
If you are using a normal DOS
slice you typically install (or leave) a standard MBR on the base disk and
then install the
.Dx
bootblocks in the slice.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl B
.Oo
.Fl b Ar boot1
.Fl s Ar boot2
.Oc
.Ar disk
.Oo Ar disktype Ns / Ns Cm auto Oc
.Pp
This form installs the bootstrap only.
It does not change the disk label.
You should never use this command on the compatibility slice unless you
intend to create a
.Dq dangerously-dedicated
disk, such as
.Ar da0s0 .
This command is typically run on a
.Bx
slice such as
.Ar da0s1 .
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl w
.Fl B
.Op Fl n
.Oo
.Fl b Ar boot1
.Fl s Ar boot2
.Oc
.Ar disk
.Op Ar disktype Ns / Ns Cm auto Op Ar packid
.Pp
This form corresponds to the
.Dq write label
command described above.
In addition to writing a new volume label, it also installs the bootstrap.
If run on the compatibility slice this command will create a
.Dq dangerously-dedicated
label.
This command is normally run on a
.Bx
slice rather than the compatibility slice.
If
.Fl n
is used, no data will be written to the device, and instead the
disklabel that would have been written will be printed to stdout.
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl R
.Fl B
.Op Fl n
.Oo
.Fl b Ar boot1
.Fl s Ar boot2
.Oc
.Ar disk Ar protofile
.Oo Ar disktype Ns / Ns Cm auto Oc
.Pp
This form corresponds to the
.Dq restore label
command described above.
In addition to restoring the volume label, it also installs the bootstrap.
If run on the compatibility slice this command will create a
.Dq dangerously-dedicated
label.
This command is normally run on a
.Bx
slice rather than the compatibility
slice.
.Pp
The bootstrap commands always access the disk directly,
so it is not necessary to specify the
.Fl r
flag.
If
.Fl n
is used, no data will be written to the device, and instead the
disklabel that would have been written will be printed to stdout.
.Pp
The bootstrap code is comprised of two boot programs.
Specify the name of the
boot programs to be installed in one of these ways:
.Bl -enum
.It
Specify the names explicitly with the
.Fl b
and
.Fl s
flags.
.Fl b
indicates the primary boot program and
.Fl s
the secondary boot program.
The boot programs are normally located in
.Pa /boot .
.It
If the
.Fl b
and
.Fl s
flags are not specified, but
.Ar disktype
was specified, the names of the programs are taken from the
.Dq b0
and
.Dq b1
parameters of the
.Xr disktab 5
entry for the disk if the disktab entry exists and includes those parameters.
.It
Otherwise, the default boot image names are used:
.Pa /boot/boot1_64
and
.Pa /boot/boot2_64
for the standard stage1 and stage2 boot images.
.El
.Ss Initializing/Formatting a bootable disk from scratch
To initialize a disk from scratch the following sequence is recommended.
Please note that this will wipe everything that was previously on the disk,
including any
.No non- Ns Dx
slices.
.Bl -enum
.It
Use
.Xr gpt 8
or
.Xr fdisk 8
to initialize the hard disk, and create a GPT or MBR slice table,
referred to as the
.Dq "partition table"
in
.Tn DOS .
.It
Use
.Nm
or
.Xr disklabel32 8
to define partitions on
.Dx
slices created in the previous step.
.It
Finally use
.Xr newfs_hammer 8 ,
.Xr newfs_hammer2 8 ,
or
.Xr newfs 8
to create file systems on new partitions.
.El
.Pp
A typical partitioning scheme would be to have an
.Ql a
partition of approximately 1 GB for
.Pa /boot
to hold the current, old (and backup) kernels and modules, a
.Ql b
partition for swap (suggested to be at least the same size as the
physical memory),
and finally a
.Ql d
partition for the root file system (usually all remaining space).
Your mileage may vary.
.Pp
.Dl "gpt init -f -B da0"
.Dl "disklabel64 -B -r -w da0s1"
.Dl "disklabel64 -e da0s1"
.Ss Expanding the disklabel
The
.Fl x[x]
option may be used to expand an existing disklabel to cover an expanded
storage device.  This is useful when an image is copied to larger underlying
storage.  If specified twice, the last partition will also be expanded to
fill the area.  Mounted HAMMER2 filesystems can also be expanded to cover
the new space in the partition.
.Pp
.Dl "gpt expand da0"
.Dl "disklabel64 -xx da0s1
.Dl "hammer2 growfs /blahblah"
.Sh ALIGNMENT
When a virgin disklabel64 is laid down a
.Dx 2.5
or later kernel will align the partition start offset relative to the
physical drive instead of relative to the slice start.
This overcomes the issue of fdisk creating a badly aligned slice by default.
The kernel will use a 1MiB (1024 * 1024 byte) alignment.
The purpose of this alignment is to match swap and cluster operations
against the physical block size of the underlying device.
.Pp
Even though nearly all devices still report a logical sector size of 512,
newer hard drives are starting to use larger physical sector sizes
and, in particular, solid state drives (SSDs) use a physical block size
of 64K (SLC) or 128K (MLC).  We choose a 1 megabyte alignment to cover our
bases down the road.  64-bit disklabels are not designed to be put on
ultra-tiny storage devices.
.Pp
It is worth noting that aligning cluster operations is particularly
important for SSDs and doubly so when
.Xr swapcache 8
is used with a SSD.
Swapcache is able to use large bulk writes which greatly reduces the degree
of write magnification on SSD media and it is possible to get upwards of
5x more endurance out of the device than the vendor spec sheet indicates.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The kernel device drivers will not allow the size of a disk partition
to be decreased or the offset of a partition to be changed while it is open.
Some device drivers create a label containing only a single large partition
if a disk is unlabeled; thus, the label must be written to the
.Ql a
partition of the disk while it is open.
This sometimes requires the desired
label to be set in two steps, the first one creating at least one other
partition, and the second setting the label on the new partition while
shrinking the
.Ql a
partition.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility
does not perform all possible error checking.
Warning
.Em is
given if partitions
overlap; if an absolute offset does not match the expected offset; if a
partition runs past the end of the device; and a number of other errors; but
no warning is given if space remains unused.
.Pp
The
.Xr disktab 5
support is not implemented.
