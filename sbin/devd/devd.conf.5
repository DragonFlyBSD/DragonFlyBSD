.Sh NAME
.Nm devd.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr devd 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss General Syntax
A
.Xr devd 8
configuration consists of two general features, statements
and comments.
All statements end with a semicolon.
Many statements can contain substatements, which are also
terminated with a semicolon.
.Pp
The following statements are supported:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic options"
.It Ic attach
Specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
a newly attached device matches said criteria.
.It Ic detach
Specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
a newly detached device matches said criteria.
.It Ic nomatch
Specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when
no device driver currently loaded in the kernel claims a (new)
device.
.It Ic notify
Specifies various matching criteria and actions to perform when the kernel
sends an event notification to userland.
.It Ic options
Specifies various options and parameters for the operation of
.Xr devd 8 .
.El
.Pp
Statements may occur in any order in the configuration file, and may be
repeated as often as required.
Further details on the syntax and meaning of each statement and their
substatements are explained below.
.Pp
Each statement, except
.Ic options
has a priority (an arbitrary number) associated with it, where
.Ql 0
is defined as the lowest priority.
If two statements match the same event, only the action of the statement with
highest priority will be executed.
In this way generic statements can be overridden for devices or
notifications that require special attention.
.Pp
The general syntax of a statement is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
statement priority {
	substatement "value";
	...
	substatement "value";
};
.Ed
.Ss Sub-statements
The following sub-statements are supported within the
.Ic options
statement.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic directory"
.It Ic directory Qq Ar /some/path ;
Adds the given directory to the list of directories from which
.Xr devd 8
will read all files named "*.conf" as further
configuration files.
Any number of
.Ic directory
statements can be used.
.It Ic pid-file Qq Pa /var/run/devd.pid ;
Specifies PID file.
.It Ic set Ar regexp-name Qq Ar (some|regexp) ;
Creates a regular expression and assigns it to the variable
.Ar regexp-name .
The variable is available throughout the rest of
the configuration file.
If the string begins with
.Ql \&! ,
it matches if the regular expression formed by the rest of the string
does not match.
All regular expressions have an implicit
.Ql ^$
around them.
.El
.Pp
The following sub-statements are supported within the
.Ic attach
and
.Ic detach
statements.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic directory"
.It Ic action Qq Ar command ;
Command to execute upon a successful match.
Example
.Dq Li "/etc/pccard_ether $device-name start" .
.It Ic class Qq Ar string ;
This is shorthand for
.Dq Ic match Qo Li class Qc Qq Ar string .
.It Ic device-name Qq string ;
This is shorthand for
.Dq Ic match Qo Li device-name Qc Qq Ar string .
This matches a device named
.Ar string ,
which is allowed to be a regular expression or a variable previously created
containing a regular expression.
The
.Dq Li device-name
variable
is available for later use with the
.Ic action
statement.
.It Ic match Qo Ar variable Qc Qq Ar value ;
Matches the content of
.Ar value
against
.Ar variable ;
the content of
.Ar value
may be a regular expression.
Not required during
.Ic attach
nor
.Ic detach
events since the
.Ic device-name
statement takes care of all device matching.
For a partial list of variables, see below.
.It Ic media-type Qq Ar string ;
For network devices,
.Ic media-type
will match devices that have the given media type.
Valid media types are:
.Dq Li Ethernet ,
.Dq Li Tokenring ,
.Dq Li FDDI ,
.Dq Li 802.11 ,
and
.Dq Li ATM .
.It Ic subdevice Qq Ar string ;
This is shorthand for
.Dq Ic match Qo Li subdevice Qc Qq Ar string .
.El
.Pp
The following sub-statements are supported within the
.Ic nomatch
statement.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic directory"
.It Ic action Qq Ar command ;
Same as above.
.It Ic match Qo Ar variable Qc Qq Ar value ;
Matches the content of
.Ar value
against
.Ar variable ;
the content of
.Ar value
may be a regular expression.
For a partial list of variables, see below.
.El
.Pp
The following sub-statements are supported within the
.Ic notify
statement.
The
.Dq Li notify
variable is available inside this statement and contains, a value, depending
on which system and subsystem that delivered the event.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ic directory"
.It Ic action Qq Ar command ;
Command to execute upon a successful match.
Example
.Dq Li "/etc/rc.d/power_profile $notify" .
.It Ic match Qo Ar system | subsystem | type | notify Qc Qq Ar value ;
Any number of
.Ic match
statements can exist within a
.Ic notify
statement;
.Ar value
can be either a fixed string or a regular expression.
Below is a list of available systems, subsystems, and types.
.It Ic media-type Qq Ar string ;
See above.
.El
.Ss Variables that can be used with the match statement

.Pp
A link state change to UP on the interface
.Dq Li fxp0
would result in the following notify event:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
system=IFNET, subsystem=fxp0, type=LINK_UP
.Ed
.Pp
An AC line state change to
.Dq offline
would result in the following event:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
system=ACPI, subsystem=ACAD, notify=0x00
.Ed
.Ss Comments
Comments may appear anywhere that whitespace may appear in a
configuration file.
To appeal to programmers of all kinds, they can
be written in C, C++, or shell/Perl constructs.
.Pp
C-style comments start with the two characters
.Ql /*
(slash, star) and end with
.Ql */
(star, slash).
Because they are completely delimited with these characters,
they can be used to comment only a portion of a line or to span
multiple lines.
.Pp
C-style comments cannot be nested.
For example, the following is
not valid because the entire comment ends with the first
.Ql */ :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/* This is the start of a comment.
   This is still part of the comment.
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */
   This is no longer in any comment. */
.Ed
.Pp
C++-style comments start with the two characters
.Ql //
(slash, slash) and continue to the end of the physical line.
They cannot be continued across multiple physical lines; to have
one logical comment span multiple lines, each line must use the
.Ql //
pair.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
// This is the start of a comment.  The next line
// is a new comment, even though it is logically
// part of the previous comment.
