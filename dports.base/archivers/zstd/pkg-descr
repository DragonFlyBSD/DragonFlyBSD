Zstandard, or zstd as short version, is a fast compression algorithm, providing
high compression ratios. It also offers a special mode for small data, called
dictionary compression. The reference library offers a very wide range of speed
/ compression trade-off, and is backed by an extremely fast decoder. Zstandard
library is provided as open source software using a BSD license. Its format is
stable and published as IETF RFC 8878.
