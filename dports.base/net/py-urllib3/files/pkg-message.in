Since version 1.25 HTTPS connections are now verified by default which is done
via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_REQUIRED'".  While certificate verification can be
disabled via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE'", it's highly recommended to leave it on.

Various consumers of net/py-urllib3 already have implemented routines that
either explicitly enable or disable HTTPS certificate verification (e.g. via
configuration settings, CLI arguments, etc.).

Yet it may happen that there are still some consumers which don't explicitly
enable/disable certificate verification for HTTPS connections which could then
lead to errors (as is often the case with self-signed certificates).

In case of an error one should try first to temporarily disable certificate
verification of the problematic urllib3 consumer to see if that approach will
remedy the issue.
