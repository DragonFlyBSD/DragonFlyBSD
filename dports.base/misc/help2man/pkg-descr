help2man is a tool for automatically generating simple manual pages from
program output.

It is intended to provide an easy way for software authors to include a
manual page in their distribution without having to maintain that document.

Given a program which produces resonably standard --help and --version
outputs, help2man will attempt to re-arrange that output into something
which resembles a manual page.
