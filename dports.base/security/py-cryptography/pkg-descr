cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to
Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic standard
library". It supports Python 3.6+ and PyPy3 7.2+.

cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common
cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key
derivation functions.
