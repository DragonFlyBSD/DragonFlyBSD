   Welcome to DragonFly! This handbook covers the installation and day to day
   use of the DragonFly operating system. This manual is a work in progress
   and is the work of many individuals. Many sections do not yet exist and
   some of those that do exist need to be updated. If you are interested in
   helping with this project, send email to the DragonFly Documentation
   project mailing list. The latest version of this document is always
   available from the DragonFly web site or mirror sites, in a variety of
   formats.

   Portions of this document originally documented use of the FreeBSD
   operating system. While many functions should be similar on DragonFly,
   some differences should be expected. If you find instructions here that no
   longer apply to DragonFly, please contact the documentation mailing list
   at DragonFly Documentation project mailing list .

                                    Preface

Intended Audience

   The DragonFly newcomer will find that the first section of this book
   guides the user through the DragonFly installation process and gently
   introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin UNIX(R). Working
   through this section requires little more than the desire to explore, and
   the ability to take on board new concepts as they are introduced.

   Once you have travelled this far, the second, far larger, section of the
   Handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest
   to DragonFly system administrators. Some of these chapters may recommend
   that you do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the
   beginning of each chapter.

   For a list of additional sources of information, please see Appendix B.

Organization of This Book

   This book is split into three logically distinct sections. The first
   section, Getting Started, covers the installation and basic usage of
   DragonFly. It is expected that the reader will follow these chapters in
   sequence, possibly skipping chapters covering familiar topics. The second
   section, System Administration, covers a broad collection of subjects that
   are of interest to more advanced DragonFly users. Each section begins with
   a succinct synopsis that describes what the chapter covers and what the
   reader is expected to already know. This is meant to allow the casual
   reader to skip around to find chapters of interest. The third section
   contains appendices of reference information.

Conventions used in this book

   To provide a consistent and easy to read text, several conventions are
   followed throughout the book.

  Typographic Conventions

   Italic

           An italic font is used for filenames, URLs, emphasized text, and
           the first usage of technical terms.

   Monospace

           A monospaced font is used for error messages, commands,
           environment variables, names of ports, hostnames, user names,
           group names, device names, variables, and code fragments.

   Bold

           A bold font is used for applications, commands, and keys.

  User Input

   Keys are shown in bold to stand out from other text. Key combinations that
   are meant to be typed simultaneously are shown with `+' between the keys,
   such as:

   Ctrl+Alt+Del

   Meaning the user should type the Ctrl, Alt,and Del keys at the same time.

   Keys that are meant to be typed in sequence will be separated with commas,
   for example:

   Ctrl+X, Ctrl+S

   Would mean that the user is expected to type the Ctrl and X keys
   simultaneously and then to type the Ctrl and S keys simultaneously.

  Examples

   Examples starting with # indicate a command that must be invoked as the
   superuser in DragonFly. You can login as root to type the command, or
   login as your normal account and use su(1) to gain superuser privileges.

 # dd if=kern.flp of=/dev/fd0

   Examples starting with % indicate a command that should be invoked from a
   normal user account. Unless otherwise noted, C-shell syntax is used for
   setting environment variables and other shell commands.

 % top

   Examples starting with E:\> indicate a MS-DOS(R) command. Unless otherwise
   noted, these commands may be executed from a ``Command Prompt'' window in
   a modern Microsoft(R) Windows(R) environment.

1.1 Synopsis

   Thank you for your interest in DragonFly! The following chapter covers
   various aspects of the DragonFly Project, such as its history, goals,
   development model, and so on.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How DragonFly relates to other computer operating systems.

     * The history of the DragonFly Project.

     * The goals of the DragonFly Project.

     * The basics of the DragonFly open-source development model.

     * And of course: where the name ``DragonFly'' comes from.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 Welcome to DragonFly!

   DragonFly is a 4.4BSD-Lite based operating system for Intel (x86). A port
   to AMD64 is in progress. You can also read about the history of DragonFly,
   or the current release.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.2.1 What Can DragonFly Do?

   DragonFly has many noteworthy features. Some of these are:

     * Preemptive multitasking with dynamic priority adjustment to ensure
       smooth and fair sharing of the computer between applications and
       users, even under the heaviest of loads.

     * Multi-user facilities which allow many people to use a DragonFly
       system simultaneously for a variety of things. This means, for
       example, that system peripherals such as printers and tape drives are
       properly shared between all users on the system or the network and
       that individual resource limits can be placed on users or groups of
       users, protecting critical system resources from over-use.

     * Strong TCP/IP networking with support for industry standards such as
       SLIP, PPP, NFS, DHCP, and NIS. This means that your DragonFly machine
       can interoperate easily with other systems as well as act as an
       enterprise server, providing vital functions such as NFS (remote file
       access) and email services or putting your organization on the
       Internet with WWW, FTP, routing and firewall (security) services.

     * Memory protection ensures that applications (or users) cannot
       interfere with each other. One application crashing will not affect
       others in any way.

     * DragonFly is a 32-bit operating system.

     * The industry standard X Window System (X11R6) provides a graphical
       user interface (GUI) for the cost of a common VGA card and monitor and
       comes with full sources.

     * Binary compatibility with many programs built for Linux, SCO, SVR4,
       BSDI and NetBSD.

     * Thousands of ready-to-run applications are available from the pkgsrc
       packages collection. Why search the net when you can find it all right
       here?

     * Thousands of additional and easy-to-port applications are available on
       the Internet. DragonFly is source code compatible with most popular
       commercial UNIX systems and thus most applications require few, if
       any, changes to compile.

     * Demand paged virtual memory and ``merged VM/buffer cache'' design
       efficiently satisfies applications with large appetites for memory
       while still maintaining interactive response to other users.

     * SMP support for machines with multiple CPUs.

     * A full complement of C, C++, Fortran, and Perl development tools. Many
       additional languages for advanced research and development are also
       available in the ports and packages collection.

     * Source code for the entire system means you have the greatest degree
       of control over your environment. Why be locked into a proprietary
       solution at the mercy of your vendor when you can have a truly open
       system?

     * Extensive online documentation.

     * And many more!

   DragonFly is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Computer Systems
   Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley, along
   with later development of FreeBSD by the FreeBSD Project. It carries on
   the distinguished tradition of BSD systems development. In addition to the
   fine work provided by CSRG, the DragonFly Project has put in many
   thousands of hours in fine tuning the system for maximum performance and
   reliability in real-life load situations. As many of the commercial giants
   struggle to field PC operating systems with such features, performance and
   reliability, DragonFly can offer them now!

   The applications to which DragonFly can be put are truly limited only by
   your own imagination. From software development to factory automation,
   inventory control to azimuth correction of remote satellite antennae; if
   it can be done with a commercial UNIX product then it is more than likely
   that you can do it with DragonFly too! DragonFly also benefits
   significantly from literally thousands of high quality applications
   developed by research centers and universities around the world, often
   available at little to no cost. Commercial applications are also available
   and appearing in greater numbers every day.

   Because the source code for DragonFly itself is generally available, the
   system can also be customized to an almost unheard of degree for special
   applications or projects, and in ways not generally possible with
   operating systems from most major commercial vendors. Here is just a
   sampling of some of the applications in which people are currently using
   DragonFly:

     * Internet Services: The robust TCP/IP networking built into DragonFly
       makes it an ideal platform for a variety of Internet services such as:

          * FTP servers

          * World Wide Web servers (standard or secure [SSL])

          * Firewalls and NAT (``IP masquerading'') gateways

          * Electronic Mail servers

          * USENET News or Bulletin Board Systems

          * And more...

       With DragonFly, you can easily start out small with an inexpensive 386
       class PC and upgrade all the way up to a quad-processor Xeon with RAID
       storage as your enterprise grows.

     * Education: Are you a student of computer science or a related
       engineering field? There is no better way of learning about operating
       systems, computer architecture and networking than the hands on, under
       the hood experience that DragonFly can provide. A number of freely
       available CAD, mathematical and graphic design packages also make it
       highly useful to those whose primary interest in a computer is to get
       other work done!

     * Research: With source code for the entire system available, DragonFly
       is an excellent platform for research in operating systems as well as
       other branches of computer science. DragonFly's freely available
       nature also makes it possible for remote groups to collaborate on
       ideas or shared development without having to worry about special
       licensing agreements or limitations on what may be discussed in open
       forums.

     * Networking: Need a new router? A name server (DNS)? A firewall to keep
       people out of your internal network? DragonFly can easily turn that
       unused older PC sitting in the corner into an advanced router with
       sophisticated packet-filtering capabilities.

     * X Window workstation: DragonFly is a fine choice for an inexpensive X
       terminal solution, either using the freely available XFree86 or X.org
       servers or one of the excellent commercial servers provided by Xi
       Graphics. Unlike an X terminal, DragonFly allows many applications to
       be run locally if desired, thus relieving the burden on a central
       server. DragonFly can even boot ``diskless'', making individual
       workstations even cheaper and easier to administer.

     * Software Development: The basic DragonFly system comes with a full
       complement of development tools including the renowned GNU C/C++
       compiler and debugger.

   DragonFly is available via anonymous FTP or CVS. Please see Appendix A for
   more information about obtaining DragonFly.

1.3 About the DragonFly Project

   The following section provides some background information on the project,
   including a brief history, project goals, and the development model of the
   project.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.3.1 A Brief History of DragonFly

   Matthew Dillon, one of the developers for FreeBSD, was growing
   increasingly frustrated with the FreeBSD Project's direction for release
   5. The FreeBSD 5 release had been delayed multiple times, and had
   performance problems compared to earlier releases of FreeBSD.

   DragonFly was announced in June of 2003. The code base was taken from the
   4.8 release of FreeBSD, which offered better performance and more complete
   features.

   Development has proceeded at a very quick rate since then, with Matt
   Dillon and a small group of developers fixing longstanding BSD bugs and
   modernizing the new DragonFly system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.3.2 DragonFly Project Goals

   DragonFly is an effort to maintain the traditional BSD format -- lean,
   stable code -- along with modern features such as lightweight threads, a
   workable packaging system, and a revised VFS. Underpinning all this work
   is efficient support for multiple processors, something rare among open
   source systems. Because DragonFly is built on an existing very stable code
   base, it is possible to make these radical changes as part of an
   incremental process.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.3.3 The DragonFly Development Model

   Written by Justin Sherrill.

   DragonFly is developed by many people around the world. There is no
   qualification process; anyone may submit his or her code, documentation,
   or designs, for use in the Project. Here is a general description of the
   Project's organizational structure.

   The CVS repository

           Source for DragonFly is kept in CVS (Concurrent Versions System),
           which is available with each DragonFly install. The primary CVS
           repository resides on a machine in California, USA. Documentation
           on obtaining the DragonFly source is available elsewhere in this
           book.

   Commit access

           The best way of getting changes made to the DragonFly source is to
           mail the submit mailing list. Including desired source code
           changes (unified diff format is best) is the most useful format. A
           certain number of developers have access to commit changes to the
           DragonFly source, and can do so after review on that list.

   The DragonFly development model is loose; changes to the code are
   generally peer-reviewed and added when any objections have been corrected.
   There is no formal entry/rejection process, though final say on all code
   submissions goes to Matt Dillon, as originator of this project.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.3.4 The Current DragonFly Release

   DragonFly is a freely available, full source 4.4BSD-Lite based release for
   Intel i386(TM), i486(TM), Pentium(R), Pentium Pro, Celeron(R), Pentium II,
   Pentium III, Pentium 4 (or compatible), and Xeon(TM) based computer
   systems. It is based primarily on FreeBSD 4.8, and includes enhancements
   from U.C. Berkeley's CSRG group, NetBSD, OpenBSD, 386BSD, and the Free
   Software Foundation.

   A number of additional documents which you may find very helpful in the
   process of installing and using DragonFly may now also be found in the
   /usr/share/doc directory on any machine.

   The most up-to-date documentation can be found at
   http://www.dragonflybsd.org/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.3.5 "DragonFly" Origin

   Matthew Dillon happened to take a picture of a dragonfly in his garden
   while trying to come up with a name for this new branch of BSD. Taking
   this as inspiration, "DragonFly" became the new name.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Chapter 2 Installation from CD

   Written by Markus Schatzl and Justin Sherrill.

2.1 CD Installation Overview

   This document describes the installation of DragonFly BSD on a plain i386
   machine. This process uses a bootable DragonFly CD, usually referred to as
   a 'live CD'.

   This CD is available at one of the current mirrors, which distribute the
   images by various protocols. The authorative list can be found at the
   DragonFly website.

   This document may be superseded by the /README file located on the live
   CD, which may reflect changes made after this document was last updated.
   Check that README for any last-minute changes and for an abbreviated
   version of this installation process.

   The DragonFly development team is working on an automatic installation
   tool, which simplifies the partitioning and installation processes. Until
   this tool is in place, the manual process here is required. Some
   experience with BSD-style tools is recommended.

     Caution: While this guide covers installing to a computer with an
     existing non-DragonFly operating system, take no chances! Back up any
     data on your disk drives that you want to save.

   When installing to an old machine, it may not be possible to boot from a
   CD. Use a bootmanager on a floppy in those cases, such as Smart
   Bootmanager.

     Caution: Always be sure of the target disk for any command. Unless
     otherwise specified, each command here assumes the first disk in the IDE
     chain is the target. (ad0) Adjust commands as needed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 CD Installation - Making room

  2.2.1 DragonFly as the only operating system

   If DragonFly is to be the only operating system on the target computer,
   preparing the disk is a short and simple process. Boot with the live CD,
   and log in as root to reach a command prompt.

   First, the master boot record (MBR) must be cleared of any old
   information. This command clears all old data off your disk by writing
   zeros (if=/dev/zero) onto the system's master ata drive (of=/dev/ad0).

         # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ad0 bs=32k count=16
        

   The now-empty disk must be formatted.

     Important: This will destroy any existing data on a disk. Do this only
     if you plan to dedicate this disk to DragonFly.

         # fdisk -I ad0
         # fdisk -B ad0
        

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.2.2 Multiple operating systems on one hard disk

   This example assumes that the target computer for installation has at
   least one operating system installed that needs to survive the
   installation process. A new partition for DragonFly needs to be created
   from the existing partition(s) that otherwise fill the disk. There must be
   unused space within the existing partition in order to resize it.

     Important: The new partition is created from empty space in an existing
     partition. For example, an 18 gigabyte disk that has 17 gigabytes of
     existing data in the existing partition will only have 1 gigabyte
     available for the new partition.

   Partition resizing needs to be accomplished with a third-party tool.
   Commercial programs such as Partition Magic can accomplish these tasks.
   Free tools exist that can be adapted to this task, such as 'GNU parted',
   found on the Knoppix CD, or PAUD.

   Create a new partition of at least 5-6 gigabytes. It is possible to
   install within a smaller amount of disk space, but this will create
   problems not covered by this document. The newly created partition does
   not need to be formatted; the rest of the installation process treats that
   new partiton as a new disk.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.2.3 Multiple operating systems, multiple hard disks

   Installing DragonFly to a separate disk removes the need for partition
   resizing, and is generally safer when trying to preserve an existing
   operating system installation.

   This type of installation is very similar to installing DragonFly as the
   only operating system. The only difference is the disk named in each
   command.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 CD Installation - Disk setup

  2.3.1 Disk formatting

   The slice layout on the newly formatted disk or partition needs to be set
   up, using this command.

           # fdisk -u
          

   If there are multiple operating systems on the disk, pick the correct
   partition judging by what partitions were created earlier with a resizing
   tool.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.3.2 Boot block installation

   The 'ad0' here refers to the first disk on the first IDE bus of a
   computer. Increment the number if the target disk is farther down the
   chain. For example, the master disk on the second IDE controller would be
   'ad2'.

           # boot0cfg -B ad0
           # boot0cfg -v ad0
          

   -s SLICE, where SLICE is a number, controls which slice on disk is used by
   boot0cfg to start from. By default, this number is 1, and will only need
   modification if a different slice contains DragonFly.

   Use -o packet as an option to boot0cfg if the DragonFly partition is
   located beyond cylinder 1023 on the disk. This location problem usually
   only happens when another operating system is taking up more than the
   first 8 gigabytes of disk space. This problem cannot happen if DragonFly
   is installed to a dedicated disk

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.3.3 Disklabel

   If DragonFly is installed anywhere but the first partition of the disk,
   the device entry for that partition will have to be created. Otherwise,
   the device entry is automatically created. Refer to this different
   partition instead of the 'ad0s1a' used in later examples.

           # cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV ad0s2
          

   The partition needs to be created on the DragonFly disk.

           # disklabel -B -r -w ad0s1 auto
          

   Using /etc/disklabel.ad0s1 as an example, issue the following command to
   edit the disklabel for the just-created partition.

           # disklabel -e ad0s1
          

   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Partition |    Size     |              Mountpoint              |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2a    | 256m        | /                                    |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2b    | 1024m       | swap                                 |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2c    | leave alone | This represents the whole slice.     |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2d    | 256m        | /var                                 |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2e    | 256m        | /tmp !                               |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2f    | 8192m       | /usr - This should be at least 4096m |
   |-----------+-------------+--------------------------------------|
   | ad0s2g    | *           | /home - This holds 'everything else' |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.3.4 Partition Format

   newfs will format each individual partition.

           # newfs /dev/ad0s1a
           # newfs -U /dev/ad0s1d
           # newfs -U /dev/ad0s1e
           # newfs -U /dev/ad0s1f
           # newfs -U /dev/ad0s1g
          

     Note: The -U option is not used for the root partition, since / is
     usually relatively small. Softupdates can cause it to run out of space
     while under a lot of disk activity, such as a buildworld.

     Note: The command listing skips directly from ad0s1a to ad0s1d. This is
     because /dev/ad0s1b is used as swap and does not require formatting;
     ad0s1c refers to the entire disk and should not be formatted.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 Installing to Disk from CD

   Since the Live CD contains all needed data to create a running DragonFly
   system, the simplest installation possible is to copy the Live CD data to
   the newly formatted disk/partition created in previous steps.

   These commands mount the newly created disk space and create the
   appropriate directories on it.

       # mount /dev/ad0s1a /mnt
       # mkdir /mnt/var
       # mkdir /mnt/tmp
       # mkdir /mnt/usr
       # mkdir /mnt/home
       # mount /dev/ad0s1d /mnt/var
       # mount /dev/ad0s1e /mnt/tmp
       # mount /dev/ad0s1f /mnt/usr
       # mount /dev/ad0s1g /mnt/home
      

   cpdup duplicates data from one volume to another. These commands copy data
   from the Live CD to the newly created directories on the mounted disk.
   Each step can take some time, depending on disk speed.

       # cpdup / /mnt
       # cpdup /var /mnt/var
       # cpdup /etc /mnt/etc
       # cpdup /dev /mnt/dev
       # cpdup /usr /mnt/usr
      

     Note: Nothing is copied to the /tmp directory that was created in the
     previous step. This is not an error, since /tmp is intended only for
     temporary storage.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 CD Installation - Post-install cleanup

   /tmp and /var/tmp are both often used as temporary directories. Since use
   is not consistent from application to application, it is worthwhile to
   create /tmp as a link to /var/tmp so space is not wasted in duplication.

       # chmod 1777 /mnt/tmp
       # rm -fr /mnt/var/tmp
       # ln -s /tmp /mnt/var/tmp
      

     Note: /tmp will not work until the computer is rebooted.

   The file /etc/fstab describes the disk partition layout. However, the
   version copied to the target disk only reflects the Live CD layout. The
   installed /mnt/fstab.example can be used as a starting point for creating
   a new /etc/fstab.

       # vi /mnt/etc/fstab.example
       # mv /mnt/etc/fstab.example /mnt/etc/fstab
      

   A corrupted disklabel will render a disk useless. While this is thankfully
   very rare, having a backup of the new install's disklabel may stave off
   disaster at some point in the future. This is optional. (Adjust the slice
   name to reflect the actual installation.)

       # disklabel ad0s1 > /mnt/etc/disklabel.backup
      

     Note: Nothing is copied to the /tmp directory that was created in the
     previous step. This is not an error, since /tmp is intended only for
     temporary storage.

   Remove some unnecessary files copied over from the Live CD.

       # rm /mnt/boot/loader.conf
       # rm /mnt/boot.catalog
       # rm -r /mnt/rr_moved
      

   The system can now be rebooted. Be sure to remove the Live CD from the
   CDROM drive so that the computer can boot from the newly-installed disk.

       # reboot
      

     Note: Use the reboot command so that the disk can be unmounted cleanly.
     Hitting the power or reset buttons, while it won't hurt the Live CD, can
     leave the mounted disk in a inconsistent state.

   If the system refuses to boot, there are several options to try:

     * Old bootblocks can interfere with the initialization-process. To avoid
       this, zero-out the MBR. "of" should be changed to the correct disk
       entry if ad0 is not the targeted installation disk.

           # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ad0 bs=32 count=16
          

     * It is possible that the DragonFly slice is beyond cylinder 1023 on the
       hard disk, and can't be detected. Packet mode can fix this problem.

           # boot0cfg -o packet ad0
          

     * If you can select CHS or LBA mode in your BIOS, try changing the mode
       to LBA.

   After a successful boot from the newly installed hard drive, the timezone
   should be set. Use the command tzsetup to set the appropriate time zone.

       # tzsetup
      

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6 CD Installation - New system setup

   Once the new DragonFly system is booting from disk, there are a number of
   steps that may be useful before working further. The file /etc/rc.conf
   controls a number of options for booting the system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.6.1 Setting up rc.conf

   Depending on location, a different keyboard map may be needed. This is
   only necessary for computers outside of North America.

 
           # kbdmap
          

   Pick the appropriate keyboard map and remember the name. Place this name
   in /etc/rc.conf. For example:

           keymap="german.iso.kbd"
          

   The file /etc/rc.conf matches the one on the Live CD. Since it is now on
   an installed system are no longer running in a read-only environment, some
   changes should be made. Changes to this file will take effect after the
   next boot of the machine.

   These lines can be removed.

 syslogd_enable="NO"
 xntpd_enable="NO"
 cron_enable="NO"

   For a system which uses USB, this line will need to be modified to a value
   of "YES":

 usbd_enable="NO"

   inetd controls various small servers like telnet or ftp. By default, all
   servers are off, and must be individually uncommented in /etc/inetd.conf
   to start them. This is optional.

 inetd_enable="YES"              # Run the network daemon dispatcher (YES/NO).
 inetd_program="/usr/sbin/inetd" # path to inetd, if you want a different one.
 inetd_flags="-wW"               # Optional flags to inetd

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  2.6.2 Network Setup

   For acquiring an IP address through DHCP, place this entry in
   /etc/rc.conf, using the appropriate card name. (ep0 is used as an example
   here.)

           ifconfig_ep0="DHCP"
          

   For a fixed IP, /etc/rc.conf requires a few more lines of data. (Again,
   ep0 is used as an example here.) Supply the correct local values for IP,
   netmask, and default router. The hostname should reflect what is entered
   in DNS for this computer.

           ifconfig_ep0="inet 123.234.345.456 netmask 255.255.255.0"
           hostname="myhostname"
           defaultrouter="654.543.432.321"
          

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Chapter 3 UNIX Basics

   Rewritten by Chris Shumway.

3.1 Synopsis

   The following chapter will cover the basic commands and functionality of
   the DragonFly operating system. Much of this material is relevant for any
   UNIX-like operating system. Feel free to skim over this chapter if you are
   familiar with the material. If you are new to DragonFly, then you will
   definitely want to read through this chapter carefully.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to use the ``virtual consoles'' of DragonFly.

     * How UNIX file permissions work along with understanding file flags in
       DragonFly.

     * The default DragonFly file system layout.

     * The DragonFly disk organization.

     * How to mount and unmount file systems.

     * What processes, daemons, and signals are.

     * What a shell is, and how to change your default login environment.

     * How to use basic text editors.

     * What devices and device nodes are.

     * What binary format is used under DragonFly.

     * How to read manual pages for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 Virtual Consoles and Terminals

   DragonFly can be used in various ways. One of them is typing commands to a
   text terminal. A lot of the flexibility and power of a UNIX operating
   system is readily available at your hands when using DragonFly this way.
   This section describes what ``terminals'' and ``consoles'' are, and how
   you can use them in DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.1 The Console

   If you have not configured DragonFly to automatically start a graphical
   environment during startup, the system will present you with a login
   prompt after it boots, right after the startup scripts finish running. You
   will see something similar to:

 Additional ABI support:.
 Local package initialization:.
 Additional TCP options:.

 Fri Sep 20 13:01:06 EEST 2002

 DragonFlyBSD/i386 (pc3.example.org) (ttyv0)

 login:

   The messages might be a bit different on your system, but you will see
   something similar. The last two lines are what we are interested in right
   now. The second last line reads:

 DragonFlyBSD/i386 (pc3.example.org) (ttyv0)

   This line contains some bits of information about the system you have just
   booted. You are looking at a ``DragonFlyBSD'' console, running on an Intel
   or compatible processor of the x86 architecture[1]. The name of this
   machine (every UNIX machine has a name) is pc3.example.org, and you are
   now looking at its system console--the ttyv0 terminal.

   Finally, the last line is always:

 login:

   This is the part where you are supposed to type in your ``username'' to
   log into DragonFly. The next section describes how you can do this.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.2 Logging into DragonFly

   DragonFly is a multiuser, multiprocessing system. This is the formal
   description that is usually given to a system that can be used by many
   different people, who simultaneously run a lot of programs on a single
   machine.

   Every multiuser system needs some way to distinguish one ``user'' from the
   rest. In DragonFly (and all the UNIX-like operating systems), this is
   accomplished by requiring that every user must ``log into'' the system
   before being able to run programs. Every user has a unique name (the
   ``username'') and a personal, secret key (the ``password''). DragonFly
   will ask for these two before allowing a user to run any programs.

   Right after DragonFly boots and finishes running its startup scripts[2],
   it will present you with a prompt and ask for a valid username:

 login:

   For the sake of this example, let us assume that your username is john.
   Type john at this prompt and press Enter. You should then be presented
   with a prompt to enter a ``password'':

 login: john
 Password:

   Type in john's password now, and press Enter. The password is not echoed!
   You need not worry about this right now. Suffice it to say that it is done
   for security reasons.

   If you have typed your password correctly, you should by now be logged
   into DragonFly and ready to try out all the available commands.

   You should see the MOTD or message of the day followed by a command prompt
   (a #, $, or % character). This indicates you have successfully logged into
   DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.3 Multiple Consoles

   Running UNIX commands in one console is fine, but DragonFly can run many
   programs at once. Having one console where commands can be typed would be
   a bit of a waste when an operating system like DragonFly can run dozens of
   programs at the same time. This is where ``virtual consoles'' can be very
   helpful.

   DragonFly can be configured to present you with many different virtual
   consoles. You can switch from one of them to any other virtual console by
   pressing a couple of keys on your keyboard. Each console has its own
   different output channel, and DragonFly takes care of properly redirecting
   keyboard input and monitor output as you switch from one virtual console
   to the next.

   Special key combinations have been reserved by DragonFly for switching
   consoles[3]. You can use Alt-F1, Alt-F2, through Alt-F8 to switch to a
   different virtual console in DragonFly.

   As you are switching from one console to the next, DragonFly takes care of
   saving and restoring the screen output. The result is an ``illusion'' of
   having multiple ``virtual'' screens and keyboards that you can use to type
   commands for DragonFly to run. The programs that you launch on one virtual
   console do not stop running when that console is not visible. They
   continue running when you have switched to a different virtual console.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.4 The /etc/ttys File

   The default configuration of DragonFly will start up with eight virtual
   consoles. This is not a hardwired setting though, and you can easily
   customize your installation to boot with more or fewer virtual consoles.
   The number and settings of the virtual consoles are configured in the
   /etc/ttys file.

   You can use the /etc/ttys file to configure the virtual consoles of
   DragonFly. Each uncommented line in this file (lines that do not start
   with a # character) contains settings for a single terminal or virtual
   console. The default version of this file that ships with DragonFly
   configures nine virtual consoles, and enables eight of them. They are the
   lines that start with ttyv:

 # name  getty                           type    status          comments
 #
 ttyv0   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 # Virtual terminals
 ttyv1   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv2   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv3   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv4   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv5   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv6   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv7   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
 ttyv8   "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"  xterm   off secure

   For a detailed description of every column in this file and all the
   options you can use to set things up for the virtual consoles, consult the
   ttys(5) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.2.5 Single User Mode Console

   A detailed description of what ``single user mode'' is can be found in
   Section 7.5.2. It is worth noting that there is only one console when you
   are running DragonFly in single user mode. There are no virtual consoles
   available. The settings of the single user mode console can also be found
   in the /etc/ttys file. Look for the line that starts with console:

 # name  getty                           type    status          comments
 #
 # If console is marked "insecure", then init will ask for the root password
 # when going to single-user mode.
 console none                            unknown off secure

     Note: As the comments above the console line indicate, you can edit this
     line and change secure to insecure. If you do that, when DragonFly boots
     into single user mode, it will still ask for the root password.

     Be careful when changing this to insecure. If you ever forget the root
     password, booting into single user mode is a bit involved. It is still
     possible, but it might be a bit hard for someone who is not very
     comfortable with the DragonFly booting process and the programs
     involved.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 Permissions

   DragonFly, being a direct descendant of BSD UNIX, is based on several key
   UNIX concepts. The first and most pronounced is that DragonFly is a
   multi-user operating system. The system can handle several users all
   working simultaneously on completely unrelated tasks. The system is
   responsible for properly sharing and managing requests for hardware
   devices, peripherals, memory, and CPU time fairly to each user.

   Because the system is capable of supporting multiple users, everything the
   system manages has a set of permissions governing who can read, write, and
   execute the resource. These permissions are stored as three octets broken
   into three pieces, one for the owner of the file, one for the group that
   the file belongs to, and one for everyone else. This numerical
   representation works like this:

      Value                  Permission                 Directory Listing     
   0            No read, no write, no execute        ---                      
   1            No read, no write, execute           --x                      
   2            No read, write, no execute           -w-                      
   3            No read, write, execute              -wx                      
   4            Read, no write, no execute           r--                      
   5            Read, no write, execute              r-x                      
   6            Read, write, no execute              rw-                      
   7            Read, write, execute                 rwx                      

   You can use the -l command line argument to ls(1) to view a long directory
   listing that includes a column with information about a file's permissions
   for the owner, group, and everyone else. For example, a ls -l in an
   arbitrary directory may show:

 % ls -l
 total 530
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel     512 Sep  5 12:31 myfile
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel     512 Sep  5 12:31 otherfile
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel    7680 Sep  5 12:31 email.txt
 ...

   Here is how the first column of ls -l is broken up:

 -rw-r--r--

   The first (leftmost) character tells if this file is a regular file, a
   directory, a special character device, a socket, or any other special
   pseudo-file device. In this case, the - indicates a regular file. The next
   three characters, rw- in this example, give the permissions for the owner
   of the file. The next three characters, r--, give the permissions for the
   group that the file belongs to. The final three characters, r--, give the
   permissions for the rest of the world. A dash means that the permission is
   turned off. In the case of this file, the permissions are set so the owner
   can read and write to the file, the group can read the file, and the rest
   of the world can only read the file. According to the table above, the
   permissions for this file would be 644, where each digit represents the
   three parts of the file's permission.

   This is all well and good, but how does the system control permissions on
   devices? DragonFly actually treats most hardware devices as a file that
   programs can open, read, and write data to just like any other file. These
   special device files are stored on the /dev directory.

   Directories are also treated as files. They have read, write, and execute
   permissions. The executable bit for a directory has a slightly different
   meaning than that of files. When a directory is marked executable, it
   means it can be traversed into, that is, it is possible to ``cd'' (change
   directory) into it. This also means that within the directory it is
   possible to access files whose names are known (subject, of course, to the
   permissions on the files themselves).

   In particular, in order to perform a directory listing, read permission
   must be set on the directory, whilst to delete a file that one knows the
   name of, it is necessary to have write and execute permissions to the
   directory containing the file.

   There are more permission bits, but they are primarily used in special
   circumstances such as setuid binaries and sticky directories. If you want
   more information on file permissions and how to set them, be sure to look
   at the chmod(1) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.3.1 Symbolic Permissions

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   Symbolic permissions, sometimes referred to as symbolic expressions, use
   characters in place of octal values to assign permissions to files or
   directories. Symbolic expressions use the syntax of (who) (action)
   (permissions), where the following values are available:

           Option             Letter                  Represents              
   (who)                  u               User                                
   (who)                  g               Group owner                         
   (who)                  o               Other                               
   (who)                  a               All (``world'')                     
   (action)               +               Adding permissions                  
   (action)               -               Removing permissions                
   (action)               =               Explicitly set permissions          
   (permissions)          r               Read                                
   (permissions)          w               Write                               
   (permissions)          x               Execute                             
   (permissions)          t               Sticky bit                          
   (permissions)          s               Set UID or GID                      

   These values are used with the chmod(1) command just like before, but with
   letters. For an example, you could use the following command to block
   other users from accessing FILE:

 % chmod go= FILE

   A comma separated list can be provided when more than one set of changes
   to a file must be made. For example the following command will remove the
   groups and ``world'' write permission on FILE, then it adds the execute
   permissions for everyone:

 % chmod go-w,a+x FILE

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.3.2 DragonFly File Flags

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   In addition to file permissions discussed previously, DragonFly supports
   the use of ``file flags.'' These flags add an additional level of security
   and control over files, but not directories.

   These file flags add an additional level of control over files, helping to
   ensure that in some cases not even the root can remove or alter files.

   File flags are altered by using the chflags(1) utility, using a simple
   interface. For example, to enable the system undeletable flag on the file
   file1, issue the following command:

 # chflags sunlink
    file1

   And to disable the system undeletable flag, simply issue the previous
   command with ``no'' in front of the sunlink. Observe:

 # chflags nosunlink
    file1

   To view the flags of this file, use the ls(1) with the -lo flags:

 # ls -lo file1
   

   The output should look like the following:

 -rw-r--r--  1 trhodes  trhodes  sunlnk 0 Mar  1 05:54
 file1

   Several flags may only added or removed to files by the root user. In
   other cases, the file owner may set these flags. It is recommended an
   administrator read over the chflags(1) and chflags(2) manual pages for
   more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4 Directory Structure

   The DragonFly directory hierarchy is fundamental to obtaining an overall
   understanding of the system. The most important concept to grasp is that
   of the root directory, ``/''. This directory is the first one mounted at
   boot time and it contains the base system necessary to prepare the
   operating system for multi-user operation. The root directory also
   contains mount points for every other file system that you may want to
   mount.

   A mount point is a directory where additional file systems can be grafted
   onto the root file system. This is further described in Section 3.5.
   Standard mount points include /usr, /var, /tmp, /mnt, and /cdrom. These
   directories are usually referenced to entries in the file /etc/fstab.
   /etc/fstab is a table of various file systems and mount points for
   reference by the system. Most of the file systems in /etc/fstab are
   mounted automatically at boot time from the script rc(8) unless they
   contain the noauto option. Details can be found in Section 3.6.1.

   A complete description of the file system hierarchy is available in
   hier(7). For now, a brief overview of the most common directories will
   suffice.

      Directory                           Description                         
   /               Root directory of the file system.                         
   /bin/           User utilities fundamental to both single-user and         
                   multi-user environments.                                   
   /boot/          Programs and configuration files used during operating     
                   system bootstrap.                                          
   /boot/defaults/ Default bootstrapping configuration files; see             
                   loader.conf(5).                                            
   /dev/           Device nodes; see intro(4).                                
   /etc/           System configuration files and scripts.                    
   /etc/defaults/  Default system configuration files; see rc(8).             
   /etc/mail/      Configuration files for mail transport agents such as      
                   sendmail(8).                                               
   /etc/namedb/    named configuration files; see named(8).                   
   /etc/periodic/  Scripts that are run daily, weekly, and monthly, via       
                   cron(8); see periodic(8).                                  
   /etc/ppp/       ppp configuration files; see ppp(8).                       
   /mnt/           Empty directory commonly used by system administrators as  
                   a temporary mount point.                                   
   /proc/          Process file system; see procfs(5), mount_procfs(8).       
   /root/          Home directory for the root account.                       
   /sbin/          System programs and administration utilities fundamental   
                   to both single-user and multi-user environments.           
   /stand/         Programs used in a standalone environment.                 
                   Temporary files. The contents of /tmp are usually NOT      
   /tmp/           preserved across a system reboot. A memory-based file      
                   system is often mounted at /tmp. This can be automated     
                   with an entry in /etc/fstab; see mfs(8).                   
   /usr/           The majority of user utilities and applications.           
   /usr/bin/       Common utilities, programming tools, and applications.     
   /usr/include/   Standard C include files.                                  
   /usr/lib/       Archive libraries.                                         
   /usr/libdata/   Miscellaneous utility data files.                          
   /usr/libexec/   System daemons & system utilities (executed by other       
                   programs).                                                 
                   Local executables, libraries, etc. Within /usr/local, the  
                   general layout sketched out by hier(7) for /usr should be  
   /usr/local/     used. An exceptions is the man directory, which is         
                   directly under /usr/local rather than under                
                   /usr/local/share.                                          
   /usr/obj/       Architecture-specific target tree produced by building the 
                   /usr/src tree.                                             
                   Used as the default destination for the files installed    
   /usr/pkg        via the pkgsrc framework or pkgsrc packages (optional).    
                   The configuration directory is tunable, but the default    
                   location is /usr/pkg/etc.                                  
   /usr/pkgsrc     The pkgsrc collection for installing packages (optional).  
   /usr/sbin/      System daemons & system utilities (executed by users).     
   /usr/share/     Architecture-independent files.                            
   /usr/src/       BSD and/or local source files.                             
   /usr/X11R6/     X11R6 distribution executables, libraries, etc (optional). 
                   Multi-purpose log, temporary, transient, and spool files.  
   /var/           A memory-based file system is sometimes mounted at /var.   
                   This can be automated with an entry in /etc/fstab; see     
                   mfs(8).                                                    
   /var/log/       Miscellaneous system log files.                            
   /var/mail/      User mailbox files.

   /var/tmp/       Temporary files. The files are usually preserved across a  
                   system reboot, unless /var is a memory-based file system.  
   /var/yp         NIS maps.                                                  

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5 Disk Organization

   The smallest unit of organization that DragonFly uses to find files is the
   filename. Filenames are case-sensitive, which means that readme.txt and
   README.TXT are two separate files. DragonFly does not use the extension
   (.txt) of a file to determine whether the file is a program, or a
   document, or some other form of data.

   Files are stored in directories. A directory may contain no files, or it
   may contain many hundreds of files. A directory can also contain other
   directories, allowing you to build up a hierarchy of directories within
   one another. This makes it much easier to organize your data.

   Files and directories are referenced by giving the file or directory name,
   followed by a forward slash, /, followed by any other directory names that
   are necessary. If you have directory foo, which contains directory bar,
   which contains the file readme.txt, then the full name, or path to the
   file is foo/bar/readme.txt.

   Directories and files are stored in a file system. Each file system
   contains exactly one directory at the very top level, called the root
   directory for that file system. This root directory can then contain other
   directories.

   So far this is probably similar to any other operating system you may have
   used. There are a few differences; for example, MS-DOS uses \ to separate
   file and directory names, while Mac OS(R) uses :.

   DragonFly does not use drive letters, or other drive names in the path.
   You would not write c:/foo/bar/readme.txt on DragonFly.

   Instead, one file system is designated the root file system. The root file
   system's root directory is referred to as /. Every other file system is
   then mounted under the root file system. No matter how many disks you have
   on your DragonFly system, every directory appears to be part of the same
   disk.

   Suppose you have three file systems, called A, B, and C. Each file system
   has one root directory, which contains two other directories, called A1,
   A2 (and likewise B1, B2 and C1, C2).

   Call A the root file system. If you used the ls command to view the
   contents of this directory you would see two subdirectories, A1 and A2.
   The directory tree looks like this:

  /
  |
  +--- A1
  |
  `--- A2

   A file system must be mounted on to a directory in another file system. So
   now suppose that you mount file system B on to the directory A1. The root
   directory of B replaces A1, and the directories in B appear accordingly:

  /
  |
  +--- A1
  |     |
  |     +--- B1
  |     |
  |     `--- B2
  |
  `--- A2

   Any files that are in the B1 or B2 directories can be reached with the
   path /A1/B1 or /A1/B2 as necessary. Any files that were in /A1 have been
   temporarily hidden. They will reappear if B is unmounted from A.

   If B had been mounted on A2 then the diagram would look like this:

  /
  |
  +--- A1
  |
  `--- A2
        |
        +--- B1
        |
        `--- B2

   and the paths would be /A2/B1 and /A2/B2 respectively.

   File systems can be mounted on top of one another. Continuing the last
   example, the C file system could be mounted on top of the B1 directory in
   the B file system, leading to this arrangement:

  /
  |
  +--- A1
  |
  `--- A2
        |
        +--- B1
        |     |
        |     +--- C1
        |     |
        |     `--- C2
        |
        `--- B2

   Or C could be mounted directly on to the A file system, under the A1
   directory:

  /
  |
  +--- A1
  |     |
  |     +--- C1
  |     |
  |     `--- C2
  |
  `--- A2
        |
        +--- B1
        |
        `--- B2

   If you are familiar with MS-DOS, this is similar, although not identical,
   to the join command.

   This is not normally something you need to concern yourself with.
   Typically you create file systems when installing DragonFly and decide
   where to mount them, and then never change them unless you add a new disk.

   It is entirely possible to have one large root file system, and not need
   to create any others. There are some drawbacks to this approach, and one
   advantage.

   Benefits of Multiple File Systems

     * Different file systems can have different mount options. For example,
       with careful planning, the root file system can be mounted read-only,
       making it impossible for you to inadvertently delete or edit a
       critical file. Separating user-writable file systems, such as /home,
       from other file systems also allows them to be mounted nosuid; this
       option prevents the suid/guid bits on executables stored on the file
       system from taking effect, possibly improving security.

     * DragonFly automatically optimizes the layout of files on a file
       system, depending on how the file system is being used. So a file
       system that contains many small files that are written frequently will
       have a different optimization to one that contains fewer, larger
       files. By having one big file system this optimization breaks down.

     * DragonFly's file systems are very robust should you lose power.
       However, a power loss at a critical point could still damage the
       structure of the file system. By splitting your data over multiple
       file systems it is more likely that the system will still come up,
       making it easier for you to restore from backup as necessary.

   Benefit of a Single File System

     * File systems are a fixed size. If you create a file system when you
       install DragonFly and give it a specific size, you may later discover
       that you need to make the partition bigger. The growfs(8) command
       makes it possible to increase the size of a file system on the fly.

   File systems are contained in partitions. This does not have the same
   meaning as the common usage of the term partition (for example, MS-DOS
   partition), because of DragonFly's UNIX heritage. Each partition is
   identified by a letter from a through to h. Each partition can contain
   only one file system, which means that file systems are often described by
   either their typical mount point in the file system hierarchy, or the
   letter of the partition they are contained in.

   DragonFly also uses disk space for swap space. Swap space provides
   DragonFly with virtual memory. This allows your computer to behave as
   though it has much more memory than it actually does. When DragonFly runs
   out of memory it moves some of the data that is not currently being used
   to the swap space, and moves it back in (moving something else out) when
   it needs it.

   Some partitions have certain conventions associated with them.

   Partition                            Convention                            
   a         Normally contains the root file system                           
   b         Normally contains swap space                                     
             Normally the same size as the enclosing slice. This allows       
   c         utilities that need to work on the entire slice (for example, a  
             bad block scanner) to work on the c partition. You would not     
             normally create a file system on this partition.                 
             Partition d used to have a special meaning associated with it,   
   d         although that is now gone. To this day, some tools may operate   
             oddly if told to work on partition d.                            

   Each partition-that-contains-a-file-system is stored in what DragonFly
   calls a slice. Slice is DragonFly's term for what the common call
   partitions, and again, this is because of DragonFly's UNIX background.
   Slices are numbered, starting at 1, through to 4.

   Slice numbers follow the device name, prefixed with an s, starting at 1.
   So ``da0s1'' is the first slice on the first SCSI drive. There can only be
   four physical slices on a disk, but you can have logical slices inside
   physical slices of the appropriate type. These extended slices are
   numbered starting at 5, so ``ad0s5'' is the first extended slice on the
   first IDE disk. These devices are used by file systems that expect to
   occupy a slice.

   Slices, ``dangerously dedicated'' physical drives, and other drives
   contain partitions, which are represented as letters from a to h. This
   letter is appended to the device name, so ``da0a'' is the a partition on
   the first da drive, which is ``dangerously dedicated''. ``ad1s3e'' is the
   fifth partition in the third slice of the second IDE disk drive.

   Finally, each disk on the system is identified. A disk name starts with a
   code that indicates the type of disk, and then a number, indicating which
   disk it is. Unlike slices, disk numbering starts at 0. Common codes that
   you will see are listed in Table 3-1.

   When referring to a partition DragonFly requires that you also name the
   slice and disk that contains the partition, and when referring to a slice
   you should also refer to the disk name. Do this by listing the disk name,
   s, the slice number, and then the partition letter. Examples are shown in
   Example 3-1.

   Example 3-2 shows a conceptual model of the disk layout that should help
   make things clearer.

   In order to install DragonFly you must first configure the disk slices,
   then create partitions within the slice you will use for DragonFly, and
   then create a file system (or swap space) in each partition, and decide
   where that file system will be mounted.

          disk (ad0).                                                         
   da1s2e The fifth partition (e) on the second slice (s2) on the second SCSI 
          disk (da1).                                                         

   Example 3-2. Conceptual Model of a Disk

   This diagram shows DragonFly's view of the first IDE disk attached to the
   system. Assume that the disk is 4 GB in size, and contains two 2 GB slices
   (MS-DOS partitions). The first slice contains a MS-DOS disk, C:, and the
   second slice contains a DragonFly installation. This example DragonFly
   installation has three partitions, and a swap partition.

   The three partitions will each hold a file system. Partition a will be
   used for the root file system, e for the /var directory hierarchy, and f
   for the /usr directory hierarchy.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6 Mounting and Unmounting File Systems

   The file system is best visualized as a tree, rooted, as it were, at /.
   /dev, /usr, and the other directories in the root directory are branches,
   which may have their own branches, such as /usr/local, and so on.

   There are various reasons to house some of these directories on separate
   file systems. /var contains the directories log/, spool/, and various
   types of temporary files, and as such, may get filled up. Filling up the
   root file system is not a good idea, so splitting /var from / is often
   favorable.

   Another common reason to contain certain directory trees on other file
   systems is if they are to be housed on separate physical disks, or are
   separate virtual disks, such as Network File System mounts, or CDROM
   drives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.6.1 The fstab File

   During the boot process, file systems listed in /etc/fstab are
   automatically mounted (unless they are listed with the noauto option).

   The /etc/fstab file contains a list of lines of the following format:

 device       /mount-point fstype     options      dumpfreq     passno

   device

           A device name (which should exist), as explained in Section 12.2.

   mount-point

           A directory (which should exist), on which to mount the file
           system.

   fstype

           The file system type to pass to mount(8). The default DragonFly
           file system is ufs.

   options

           Either rw for read-write file systems, or ro for read-only file
           systems, followed by any other options that may be needed. A
           common option is noauto for file systems not normally mounted
           during the boot sequence. Other options are listed in the mount(8)
           manual page.

   dumpfreq

           This is used by dump(8) to determine which file systems require
           dumping. If the field is missing, a value of zero is assumed.

   passno

           This determines the order in which file systems should be checked.
           File systems that should be skipped should have their passno set
           to zero. The root file system (which needs to be checked before
           everything else) should have its passno set to one, and other file
           systems' passno should be set to values greater than one. If more
           than one file systems have the same passno then fsck(8) will
           attempt to check file systems in parallel if possible.

   Consult the fstab(5) manual page for more information on the format of the
   /etc/fstab file and the options it contains.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.6.2 The mount Command

   The mount(8) command is what is ultimately used to mount file systems.

   In its most basic form, you use:

 # mount device mountpoint

   There are plenty of options, as mentioned in the mount(8) manual page, but
   the most common are:

   Mount Options

   -a

           Mount all the file systems listed in /etc/fstab. Except those
           marked as ``noauto'', excluded by the -t flag, or those that are
           already mounted.

   -d

           Do everything except for the actual mount system call. This option
           is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to determine what
           mount(8) is actually trying to do.

   -f

           Force the mount of an unclean file system (dangerous), or forces
           the revocation of write access when downgrading a file system's
           mount status from read-write to read-only.

   -r

           Mount the file system read-only. This is identical to using the
           rdonly argument to the -o option.

   -t fstype

           Mount the given file system as the given file system type, or
           mount only file systems of the given type, if given the -a option.

           ``ufs'' is the default file system type.

   -u

           Update mount options on the file system.

   -v

           Be verbose.

   -w

           Mount the file system read-write.

   The -o option takes a comma-separated list of the options, including the
   following:

   nodev

           Do not interpret special devices on the file system. This is a
           useful security option.

   noexec

           Do not allow execution of binaries on this file system. This is
           also a useful security option.

   nosuid

           Do not interpret setuid or setgid flags on the file system. This
           is also a useful security option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.6.3 The umount Command

   The umount(8) command takes, as a parameter, one of a mountpoint, a device
   name, or the -a or -A option.

   All forms take -f to force unmounting, and -v for verbosity. Be warned
   that -f is not generally a good idea. Forcibly unmounting file systems
   might crash the computer or damage data on the file system.

   -a and -A are used to unmount all mounted file systems, possibly modified
   by the file system types listed after -t. -A, however, does not attempt to
   unmount the root file system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.7 Processes

   DragonFly is a multi-tasking operating system. This means that it seems as
   though more than one program is running at once. Each program running at
   any one time is called a process. Every command you run will start at
   least one new process, and there are a number of system processes that run
   all the time, keeping the system functional.

   Each process is uniquely identified by a number called a process ID, or
   PID, and, like files, each process also has one owner and group. The owner
   and group information is used to determine what files and devices the
   process can open, using the file permissions discussed earlier. Most
   processes also have a parent process. The parent process is the process
   that started them. For example, if you are typing commands to the shell
   then the shell is a process, and any commands you run are also processes.
   Each process you run in this way will have your shell as its parent
   process. The exception to this is a special process called init(8). init
   is always the first process, so its PID is always 1. init is started
   automatically by the kernel when DragonFly starts.

   Two commands are particularly useful to see the processes on the system,
   ps(1) and top(1). The ps command is used to show a static list of the
   currently running processes, and can show their PID, how much memory they
   are using, the command line they were started with, and so on. The top
   command displays all the running processes, and updates the display every
   few seconds, so that you can interactively see what your computer is
   doing.

   By default, ps only shows you the commands that are running and are owned
   by you. For example:

 % ps
   PID  TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND
   298  p0  Ss     0:01.10 tcsh
  7078  p0  S      2:40.88 xemacs mdoc.xsl (xemacs-21.1.14)
 37393  p0  I      0:03.11 xemacs freebsd.dsl (xemacs-21.1.14)
 48630  p0  S      2:50.89 /usr/local/lib/netscape-linux/navigator-linux-4.77.bi
 48730  p0  IW     0:00.00 (dns helper) (navigator-linux-)
 72210  p0  R+     0:00.00 ps
   390  p1  Is     0:01.14 tcsh
  7059  p2  Is+    1:36.18 /usr/local/bin/mutt -y
  6688  p3  IWs    0:00.00 tcsh
 10735  p4  IWs    0:00.00 tcsh
 20256  p5  IWs    0:00.00 tcsh
   262  v0  IWs    0:00.00 -tcsh (tcsh)
   270  v0  IW+    0:00.00 /bin/sh /usr/X11R6/bin/startx -- -bpp 16
   280  v0  IW+    0:00.00 xinit /home/nik/.xinitrc -- -bpp 16
   284  v0  IW     0:00.00 /bin/sh /home/nik/.xinitrc
   285  v0  S      0:38.45 /usr/X11R6/bin/sawfish

   As you can see in this example, the output from ps(1) is organized into a
   number of columns. PID is the process ID discussed earlier. PIDs are
   assigned starting from 1, go up to 99999, and wrap around back to the
   beginning when you run out. The TT column shows the tty the program is
   running on, and can safely be ignored for the moment. STAT shows the
   program's state, and again, can be safely ignored. TIME is the amount of
   time the program has been running on the CPU--this is usually not the
   elapsed time since you started the program, as most programs spend a lot
   of time waiting for things to happen before they need to spend time on the
   CPU. Finally, COMMAND is the command line that was used to run the
   program.

   ps(1) supports a number of different options to change the information
   that is displayed. One of the most useful sets is auxww. a displays
   information about all the running processes, not just your own. u displays
   the username of the process' owner, as well as memory usage. x displays
   information about daemon processes, and ww causes ps(1) to display the
   full command line, rather than truncating it once it gets too long to fit
   on the screen.

   The output from top(1) is similar. A sample session looks like this:

 % top
 last pid: 72257;  load averages:  0.13,  0.09,  0.03    up 0+13:38:33  22:39:10

 CPU states: 12.6% user,  0.0% nice,  7.8% system,  0.0% interrupt, 79.7% idle
 Mem: 36M Active, 5256K Inact, 13M Wired, 6312K Cache, 15M Buf, 408K Free
 Swap: 256M Total, 38M Used, 217M Free, 15% Inuse

   PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE    RES STATE    TIME   WCPU    CPU COMMAND

   281 nik        2   0 18636K  7112K select   5:36  0.73%  0.73% XF86_SVGA
   296 nik        2   0  3240K  1644K select   0:12  0.05%  0.05% xterm
 48630 nik        2   0 29816K  9148K select   3:18  0.00%  0.00% navigator-linu
   175 root       2   0   924K   252K select   1:41  0.00%  0.00% syslogd
  7059 nik        2   0  7260K  4644K poll     1:38  0.00%  0.00% mutt
 ...

   The output is split into two sections. The header (the first five lines)
   shows the PID of the last process to run, the system load averages (which
   are a measure of how busy the system is), the system uptime (time since
   the last reboot) and the current time. The other figures in the header
   relate to how many processes are running (47 in this case), how much
   memory and swap space has been taken up, and how much time the system is
   spending in different CPU states.

   Below that are a series of columns containing similar information to the
   output from ps(1). As before you can see the PID, the username, the amount
   of CPU time taken, and the command that was run. top(1) also defaults to
   showing you the amount of memory space taken by the process. This is split
   into two columns, one for total size, and one for resident size--total
   size is how much memory the application has needed, and the resident size
   is how much it is actually using at the moment. In this example you can
   see that Netscape(R) has required almost 30 MB of RAM, but is currently
   only using 9 MB.

   top(1) automatically updates this display every two seconds; this can be
   changed with the s option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.8 Daemons, Signals, and Killing Processes

   When you run an editor it is easy to control the editor, tell it to load
   files, and so on. You can do this because the editor provides facilities
   to do so, and because the editor is attached to a terminal. Some programs
   are not designed to be run with continuous user input, and so they
   disconnect from the terminal at the first opportunity. For example, a web
   server spends all day responding to web requests, it normally does not
   need any input from you. Programs that transport email from site to site
   are another example of this class of application.

   We call these programs daemons. Daemons were characters in Greek
   mythology; neither good or evil, they were little attendant spirits that,
   by and large, did useful things for mankind. Much like the web servers and
   mail servers of today do useful things. This is why the mascot for a
   number of BSD-based operating systems has, for a long time, been a
   cheerful looking daemon with sneakers and a pitchfork.

   There is a convention to name programs that normally run as daemons with a
   trailing ``d''. BIND is the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (and the actual
   program that executes is called named), the Apache web server program is
   called httpd, the line printer spooling daemon is lpd and so on. This is a
   convention, not a hard and fast rule; for example, the main mail daemon
   for the Sendmail application is called sendmail, and not maild, as you
   might imagine.

   Sometimes you will need to communicate with a daemon process. These
   communications are called signals, and you can communicate with a daemon
   (or with any other running process) by sending it a signal. There are a
   number of different signals that you can send--some of them have a
   specific meaning, others are interpreted by the application, and the
   application's documentation will tell you how that application interprets
   signals. You can only send a signal to a process that you own. If you send
   a signal to someone else's process with kill(1) or kill(2) permission will
   be denied. The exception to this is the root user, who can send signals to
   everyone's processes.

   DragonFly will also send applications signals in some cases. If an
   application is badly written, and tries to access memory that it is not
   supposed to, DragonFly sends the process the Segmentation Violation signal
   (SIGSEGV). If an application has used the alarm(3) system call to be
   alerted after a period of time has elapsed then it will be sent the Alarm
   signal (SIGALRM), and so on.

   Two signals can be used to stop a process, SIGTERM and SIGKILL. SIGTERM is
   the polite way to kill a process; the process can catch the signal,
   realize that you want it to shut down, close any log files it may have
   open, and generally finish whatever it is doing at the time before
   shutting down. In some cases a process may even ignore SIGTERM if it is in
   the middle of some task that can not be interrupted.

   SIGKILL can not be ignored by a process. This is the ``I do not care what
   you are doing, stop right now'' signal. If you send SIGKILL to a process
   then DragonFly will stop that process there and then[4].

   The other signals you might want to use are SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, and SIGUSR2.
   These are general purpose signals, and different applications will do
   different things when they are sent.

   Suppose that you have changed your web server's configuration file--you
   would like to tell the web server to re-read its configuration. You could
   stop and restart httpd, but this would result in a brief outage period on
   your web server, which may be undesirable. Most daemons are written to
   respond to the SIGHUP signal by re-reading their configuration file. So
   instead of killing and restarting httpd you would send it the SIGHUP
   signal. Because there is no standard way to respond to these signals,
   different daemons will have different behavior, so be sure and read the
   documentation for the daemon in question.

   Signals are sent using the kill(1) command, as this example shows.

   Sending a Signal to a Process

   This example shows how to send a signal to inetd(8). The inetd
   configuration file is /etc/inetd.conf, and inetd will re-read this
   configuration file when it is sent SIGHUP.

    1. Find the process ID of the process you want to send the signal to. Do
       this using ps(1) and grep(1). The grep(1) command is used to search
       through output, looking for the string you specify. This command is
       run as a normal user, and inetd(8) is run as root, so the ax options
       must be given to ps(1).

 % ps -ax | grep inetd
   198  ??  IWs    0:00.00 inetd -wW

       So the inetd(8) PID is 198. In some cases the grep inetd command might
       also occur in this output. This is because of the way ps(1) has to
       find the list of running processes.

    2. Use kill(1) to send the signal. Because inetd(8) is being run by root
       you must use su(1) to become root first.

 % su
 Password:
 # /bin/kill -s HUP 198

       In common with most UNIX commands, kill(1) will not print any output
       if it is successful. If you send a signal to a process that you do not
       own then you will see ``kill: PID: Operation not permitted''. If you
       mistype the PID you will either send the signal to the wrong process,
       which could be bad, or, if you are lucky, you will have sent the
       signal to a PID that is not currently in use, and you will see ``kill:
       PID: No such process''.

         Why Use /bin/kill?: Many shells provide the kill command as a built
         in command; that is, the shell will send the signal directly, rather
         than running /bin/kill. This can be very useful, but different
         shells have a different syntax for specifying the name of the signal
         to send. Rather than try to learn all of them, it can be simpler
         just to use the /bin/kill ... command directly.

   Sending other signals is very similar, just substitute TERM or KILL in the
   command line as necessary.

     Important: Killing random process on the system can be a bad idea. In
     particular, init(8), process ID 1, is very special. Running /bin/kill -s
     KILL 1 is a quick way to shutdown your system. Always double check the
     arguments you run kill(1) with before you press Return.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.9 Shells

   In DragonFly, a lot of everyday work is done in a command line interface
   called a shell. A shell's main job is to take commands from the input
   channel and execute them. A lot of shells also have built in functions to
   help everyday tasks such as file management, file globbing, command line
   editing, command macros, and environment variables. DragonFly comes with a
   set of shells, such as sh, the Bourne Shell, and tcsh, the improved
   C-shell. Many other shells are available from pkgsrc, such as zsh and
   bash.

   Which shell do you use? It is really a matter of taste. If you are a C
   programmer you might feel more comfortable with a C-like shell such as
   tcsh. If you have come from Linux or are new to a UNIX command line
   interface you might try bash. The point is that each shell has unique
   properties that may or may not work with your preferred working
   environment, and that you have a choice of what shell to use.

   One common feature in a shell is filename completion. Given the typing of
   the first few letters of a command or filename, you can usually have the
   shell automatically complete the rest of the command or filename by
   hitting the Tab key on the keyboard. Here is an example. Suppose you have
   two files called foobar and foo.bar. You want to delete foo.bar. So what
   you would type on the keyboard is: rm fo[Tab].[Tab].

   The shell would print out rm foo[BEEP].bar.

   The [BEEP] is the console bell, which is the shell telling me it was
   unable to totally complete the filename because there is more than one
   match. Both foobar and foo.bar start with fo, but it was able to complete
   to foo. If you type in ., then hit Tab again, the shell would be able to
   fill in the rest of the filename for you.

   Another feature of the shell is the use of environment variables.
   Environment variables are a variable key pair stored in the shell's
   environment space. This space can be read by any program invoked by the
   shell, and thus contains a lot of program configuration. Here is a list of
   common environment variables and what they mean:

   Variable                            Description                            
   USER     Current logged in user's name.                                    
   PATH     Colon separated list of directories to search for binaries.       
   DISPLAY  Network name of the X11 display to connect to, if available.      
   SHELL    The current shell.                                                
   TERM     The name of the user's terminal. Used to determine the            
            capabilities of the terminal.                                     
   TERMCAP  Database entry of the terminal escape codes to perform various    
            terminal functions.                                               
   OSTYPE   Type of operating system. e.g., DragonFly.                        
   MACHTYPE The CPU architecture that the system is running on.               
   EDITOR   The user's preferred text editor.                                 
   PAGER    The user's preferred text pager.                                  
   MANPATH  Colon separated list of directories to search for manual pages.   

   Setting an environment variable differs somewhat from shell to shell. For
   example, in the C-Style shells such as tcsh and csh, you would use setenv
   to set environment variables. Under Bourne shells such as sh and bash, you
   would use export to set your current environment variables. For example,
   to set or modify the EDITOR environment variable, under csh or tcsh a
   command like this would set EDITOR to /usr/local/bin/emacs:

 % setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/emacs

   Under Bourne shells:

 % export EDITOR="/usr/local/bin/emacs"

   You can also make most shells expand the environment variable by placing a
   $ character in front of it on the command line. For example, echo $TERM
   would print out whatever $TERM is set to, because the shell expands $TERM
   and passes it on to echo.

   Shells treat a lot of special characters, called meta-characters as
   special representations of data. The most common one is the * character,
   which represents any number of characters in a filename. These special
   meta-characters can be used to do filename globbing. For example, typing
   in echo * is almost the same as typing in ls because the shell takes all
   the files that match * and puts them on the command line for echo to see.

   To prevent the shell from interpreting these special characters, they can
   be escaped from the shell by putting a backslash (\) character in front of
   them. echo $TERM prints whatever your terminal is set to. echo \$TERM
   prints $TERM as is.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.9.1 Changing Your Shell

   The easiest way to change your shell is to use the chsh command. Running
   chsh will place you into the editor that is in your EDITOR environment
   variable; if it is not set, you will be placed in vi. Change the
   ``Shell:'' line accordingly.

   You can also give chsh the -s option; this will set your shell for you,
   without requiring you to enter an editor. For example, if you wanted to
   change your shell to bash, the following should do the trick:

 % chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

     Note: The shell that you wish to use must be present in the /etc/shells
     file. If you have installed a shell from the pkgsrc collection, then
     this should have been done for you already. If you installed the shell
     by hand, you must do this.

     For example, if you installed bash by hand and placed it into
     /usr/local/bin, you would want to:

 # echo "/usr/local/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells

     Then rerun chsh.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.10 Text Editors

   A lot of configuration in DragonFly is done by editing text files. Because
   of this, it would be a good idea to become familiar with a text editor.
   DragonFly comes with a few as part of the base system, and many more are
   available in the pkgsrc collections.

   The easiest and simplest editor to learn is an editor called ee, which
   stands for easy editor. To start ee, one would type at the command line ee
   filename where filename is the name of the file to be edited. For example,
   to edit /etc/rc.conf, type in ee /etc/rc.conf. Once inside of ee, all of
   the commands for manipulating the editor's functions are listed at the top
   of the display. The caret ^ character represents the Ctrl key on the
   keyboard, so ^e expands to the key combination Ctrl+e. To leave ee, hit
   the Esc key, then choose leave editor. The editor will prompt you to save
   any changes if the file has been modified.

   DragonFly also comes with more powerful text editors such as vi as part of
   the base system, while other editors, like emacs and vim, are part of the
   pkgsrc collection. These editors offer much more functionality and power
   at the expense of being a little more complicated to learn. However if you
   plan on doing a lot of text editing, learning a more powerful editor such
   as vim or emacs will save you much more time in the long run.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.11 Devices and Device Nodes

   A device is a term used mostly for hardware-related activities in a
   system, including disks, printers, graphics cards, and keyboards. When
   DragonFly boots, the majority of what DragonFly displays are devices being
   detected. You can look through the boot messages again by viewing
   /var/run/dmesg.boot.

   For example, acd0 is the first IDE CDROM drive, while kbd0 represents the
   keyboard.

   Most of these devices in a UNIX operating system must be accessed through
   special files called device nodes, which are located in the /dev
   directory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.11.1 Creating Device Nodes with MAKEDEV

   When adding a new device to your system, or compiling in support for
   additional devices, you may need to create one or more device nodes for
   the new devices.

   Device nodes are created using the MAKEDEV(8) script as shown below:

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV ad1
      

   This example would make the proper device nodes for the second IDE drive
   when installed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.12 Binary Formats

   To understand why DragonFly uses the elf(5) format, you must first know a
   little about the three currently ``dominant'' executable formats for UNIX:

     * a.out(5)

       The oldest and ``classic'' UNIX object format. It uses a short and
       compact header with a magic number at the beginning that is often used
       to characterize the format (see a.out(5) for more details). It
       contains three loaded segments: .text, .data, and .bss plus a symbol
       table and a string table.

     * COFF

       The SVR3 object format. The header now comprises a section table, so
       you can have more than just .text, .data, and .bss sections.

     * elf(5)

       The successor to COFF, featuring multiple sections and 32-bit or
       64-bit possible values. One major drawback: ELF was also designed with
       the assumption that there would be only one ABI per system
       architecture. That assumption is actually quite incorrect, and not
       even in the commercial SYSV world (which has at least three ABIs:
       SVR4, Solaris, SCO) does it hold true.

       DragonFly tries to work around this problem somewhat by providing a
       utility for branding a known ELF executable with information about the
       ABI it is compliant with. See the manual page for brandelf(1) for more
       information. DragonFly runs ELF.

   So, why are there so many different formats?

   Back in the dim, dark past, there was simple hardware. This simple
   hardware supported a simple, small system. a.out was completely adequate
   for the job of representing binaries on this simple system (a PDP-11). As
   people ported UNIX from this simple system, they retained the a.out format
   because it was sufficient for the early ports of UNIX to architectures
   like the Motorola 68k, VAXen, etc.

   Then some bright hardware engineer decided that if he could force software
   to do some sleazy tricks, then he would be able to shave a few gates off
   the design and allow his CPU core to run faster. While it was made to work
   with this new kind of hardware (known these days as RISC), a.out was
   ill-suited for this hardware, so many formats were developed to get to a
   better performance from this hardware than the limited, simple a.out
   format could offer. Things like COFF, ECOFF, and a few obscure others were
   invented and their limitations explored before things seemed to settle on
   ELF.

   In addition, program sizes were getting huge and disks (and physical
   memory) were still relatively small so the concept of a shared library was
   born. The VM system also became more sophisticated. While each one of
   these advancements was done using the a.out format, its usefulness was
   stretched more and more with each new feature. In addition, people wanted
   to dynamically load things at run time, or to junk parts of their program
   after the init code had run to save in core memory and swap space.
   Languages became more sophisticated and people wanted code called before
   main automatically. Lots of hacks were done to the a.out format to allow
   all of these things to happen, and they basically worked for a time. In
   time, a.out was not up to handling all these problems without an ever
   increasing overhead in code and complexity. While ELF solved many of these
   problems, it would be painful to switch from the system that basically
   worked. So ELF had to wait until it was more painful to remain with a.out
   than it was to migrate to ELF.

   ELF is more expressive than a.out and allows more extensibility in the
   base system. The ELF tools are better maintained, and offer cross
   compilation support, which is important to many people. ELF may be a
   little slower than a.out, but trying to measure it can be difficult. There
   are also numerous details that are different between the two in how they
   map pages, handle init code, etc. None of these are very important, but
   they are differences.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.13 For More Information

  3.13.1 Manual Pages

   The most comprehensive documentation on DragonFly is in the form of manual
   pages. Nearly every program on the system comes with a short reference
   manual explaining the basic operation and various arguments. These manuals
   can be viewed with the man command. Use of the man command is simple:

 % man command

   command is the name of the command you wish to learn about. For example,
   to learn more about ls command type:

 % man ls

   The online manual is divided up into numbered sections:

    1. User commands.

    2. System calls and error numbers.

    3. Functions in the C libraries.

    4. Device drivers.

    5. File formats.

    6. Games and other diversions.

    7. Miscellaneous information.

    8. System maintenance and operation commands.

    9. Kernel internals.

   In some cases, the same topic may appear in more than one section of the
   online manual. For example, there is a chmod user command and a chmod()
   system call. In this case, you can tell the man command which one you want
   by specifying the section:

 % man 1 chmod

   This will display the manual page for the user command chmod. References
   to a particular section of the online manual are traditionally placed in
   parenthesis in written documentation, so chmod(1) refers to the chmod user
   command and chmod(2) refers to the system call.

   This is fine if you know the name of the command and simply wish to know
   how to use it, but what if you cannot recall the command name? You can use
   man to search for keywords in the command descriptions by using the -k
   switch:

 % man -k mail

   With this command you will be presented with a list of commands that have
   the keyword ``mail'' in their descriptions. This is actually functionally
   equivalent to using the apropos command.

   So, you are looking at all those fancy commands in /usr/bin but do not
   have the faintest idea what most of them actually do? Simply do:

 % cd /usr/bin
 % man -f *

   or

 % cd /usr/bin
 % whatis *

   which does the same thing.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  3.13.2 GNU Info Files

   DragonFly includes many applications and utilities produced by the Free
   Software Foundation (FSF). In addition to manual pages, these programs
   come with more extensive hypertext documents called info files which can
   be viewed with the info command or, if you installed emacs, the info mode
   of emacs.

   To use the info(1) command, simply type:

 % info

   For a brief introduction, type h. For a quick command reference, type ?.

       Chapter 4 Installing Applications using NetBSD's pkgsrc framework

4.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly is bundled with a rich collection of system tools as part of the
   base system. However, there is only so much one can do before needing to
   install an additional third-party application to get real work done.
   DragonFly utilizes NetBSD's pkgsrc framework (pkgsrc.org) for installing
   third party software on your system. This system may be used to install
   the newest version of your favorite applications from local media or
   straight off the network.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to install third-party binary software packages from the pkgsrc
       collection.

     * How to build third-party software from the pkgsrc collection.

     * Where to find DragonFly-specific changes to packages.

     * How to remove previously installed packages.

     * How to override the default values that the pkgsrc collection uses.

     * How to upgrade your packages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 Overview of Software Installation

   If you have used a UNIX system before you will know that the typical
   procedure for installing third party software goes something like this:

    1. Download the software, which might be distributed in source code
       format, or as a binary.

    2. Unpack the software from its distribution format (typically a tarball
       compressed with compress(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1)).

    3. Locate the documentation (perhaps an INSTALL or README file, or some
       files in a doc/ subdirectory) and read up on how to install the
       software.

    4. If the software was distributed in source format, compile it. This may
       involve editing a Makefile, or running a configure script, and other
       work.

    5. Test and install the software.

   And that is only if everything goes well. If you are installing a software
   package that was not deliberately ported to DragonFly you may even have to
   go in and edit the code to make it work properly.

   Should you want to, you can continue to install software the
   ``traditional'' way with DragonFly. However, DragonFly provides technology
   from NetBSD, which can save you a lot of effort: pkgsrc. At the time of
   writing, over 6,000 third party applications have been made available in
   this way.

   For any given application, the DragonFly Binary package for that
   application is a single file which you must download. The package contains
   pre-compiled copies of all the commands for the application, as well as
   any configuration files or documentation. A downloaded package file can be
   manipulated with DragonFly package management commands, such as
   pkg_add(1), pkg_delete(1), pkg_info(1), and so on. Installing a new
   application can be carried out with a single command.

   In addition the pkgsrc collection supplies a collection of files designed
   to automate the process of compiling an application from source code.

   Remember that there are a number of steps you would normally carry out if
   you compiled a program yourself (downloading, unpacking, patching,
   compiling, installing). The files that make up a pkgsrc source collection
   contain all the necessary information to allow the system to do this for
   you. You run a handful of simple commands and the source code for the
   application is automatically downloaded, extracted, patched, compiled, and
   installed for you.

   In fact, the pkgsrc source subsystem can also be used to generate packages
   which can later be manipulated with pkg_add and the other package
   management commands that will be introduced shortly.

   Pkgsrc understands dependencies. Suppose you want to install an
   application that depends on a specific library being installed. Both the
   application and the library have been made available through the pkgsrc
   collection. If you use the pkg_add command or the pkgsrc subsystem to add
   the application, both will notice that the library has not been installed,
   and automatically install the library first.

   You might be wondering why pkgsrc bothers with both. Binary packages and
   the source tree both have their own strengths, and which one you use will
   depend on your own preference.

   Binary Package Benefits

     * A compressed package tarball is typically smaller than the compressed
       tarball containing the source code for the application.

     * Packages do not require any additional compilation. For large
       applications, such as Mozilla, KDE, or GNOME this can be important,
       particularly if you are on a slow system.

     * Packages do not require any understanding of the process involved in
       compiling software on DragonFly.

   Pkgsrc source Benefits

     * Binary packages are normally compiled with conservative options,
       because they have to run on the maximum number of systems. By
       installing from the source, you can tweak the compilation options to
       (for example) generate code that is specific to a Pentium IV or Athlon
       processor.

     * Some applications have compile time options relating to what they can
       and cannot do. For example, Apache can be configured with a wide
       variety of different built-in options. By building from the source you
       do not have to accept the default options, and can set them yourself.

       In some cases, multiple packages will exist for the same application
       to specify certain settings. For example, vim is available as a vim
       package and a vim-gtk package, depending on whether you have installed
       an X11 server. This sort of rough tweaking is possible with packages,
       but rapidly becomes impossible if an application has more than one or
       two different compile time options.

     * The licensing conditions of some software distributions forbid binary
       distribution. They must be distributed as source code.

     * Some people do not trust binary distributions. With source code, it is
       possible to check for any vulnerabilities built into the program
       before installing it to an otherwise secure system. Few people perform
       this much review, however.

     * If you have local patches, you will need the source in order to apply
       them.

     * Some people like having code around, so they can read it if they get
       bored, hack it, borrow from it (license permitting, of course), and so
       on.

   To keep track of updated pkgsrc releases subscribe to the netBSD pkgsrc
   users mailing list and the netBSD pkgsrc users mailing list. It's also
   useful to watch the DragonFly User related mailing list as errors with
   pkgsrc on DragonFly should be reported there.

     Warning: Before installing any application, you should check
     http://www.pkgsrc.org/ for security issues related to your application.

     You can also install security/audit-packages which will automatically
     check all installed applications for known vulnerabilities, a check will
     be also performed before any application build. Meanwhile, you can use
     the command audit-packages -d after you have installed some packages.

   The remainder of this chapter will explain how to use the pkgsrc system to
   install and manage third party software on DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 Finding Your Application

   Before you can install any applications you need to know what you want,
   and what the application is called.

   DragonFly's list of available applications is growing all the time.
   Fortunately, there are a number of ways to find what you want:

     * There is a pkgsrc related web site that maintains an up-to-date
       searchable list of all the available applications, at
       http://pkgsrc.se. The packages and the corresponding source tree are
       divided into categories, and you may either search for an application
       by name (if you know it), or see all the applications available in a
       category.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 Using the Binary Packages System

   Original FreeBSD documentation contributed by DragonFly BSD customizations
   contributed by Chern Lee and Adrian Nida.

  4.4.1 Installing a Binary Package

   You can use the pkg_add(1) utility to install a pkgsrc software package
   from a local file or from a server on the network.

   Example 4-1. Downloading a Package Manually and Installing It Locally

 # ftp -a packages.stura.uni-rostock.de
 Connected to fsr.uni-rostock.de.
 220 packages.stura.uni-rostock.de FTP server (Version 6.00LS) ready.

 174638 bytes received in 00:01 (159.30 KB/s)
 ftp> exit
 221 Goodbye.
 # pkg_add 0verkill-0.15.tgz

     Note: It should be noted that simply issuing:

 # pkg_add ftp://packages.stura.uni-rostock.de/pkgsrc-current/DragonFly/RELEASE/i386/All/0verkill-0.15.tgz

     will yield the same result as the above example.

   Unlike the FreeBSD version, the Pkgsrc pkg_add(1) does not need to be
   passed the -r option. As can be seen from the second example, you just
   need to pass in the URL of the package. The utility will also always
   automatically fetch and install all dependencies.

   The example above would download the correct package and add it without
   any further user intervention. If you want to specify an alternative
   DragonFly Packages Mirror, instead of the main distribution site, you have
   to set PACKAGESITE accordingly, to override the default settings.
   pkg_add(1) uses fetch(3) to download the files, which honors various
   environment variables, including FTP_PASSIVE_MODE, FTP_PROXY, and
   FTP_PASSWORD. You may need to set one or more of these if you are behind a
   firewall, or need to use an FTP/HTTP proxy. See fetch(3) for the complete
   list.

   Binary package files are distributed in .tgz formats. You can find them at
   the default location ftp://goBSD.com//packages/, among other sites. The
   layout of the packages is similar to that of the /usr/pkgsrc tree. Each
   category has its own directory, and every package can be found within the
   All directory.

   The directory structure of the binary package system matches the source
   tree layout; they work with each other to form the entire package system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.4.2 Managing Packages

   pkg_info(1) is a utility that lists and describes the various packages
   installed.

 # pkg_info
 digest-20050731     Message digest wrapper utility
 screen-4.0.2nb4     Multi-screen window manager
 ...

   pkg_version(1) is a utility that summarizes the versions of all installed
   packages. It compares the package version to the current version found in
   the ports tree.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.4.3 Deleting a Package

   To remove a previously installed software package, use the pkg_delete(1)
   utility.

 # pkg_delete xchat-1.7.1

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.4.4 Miscellaneous

   All package information is stored within the /var/db/pkg directory. The
   installed file list and descriptions of each package can be found within
   subdirectories of this directory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5 Using the pkgsrc(R) Source Tree

   The following sections provide basic instructions on using the pkgsrc
   source tree to install or remove programs from your system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.5.1 Obtaining the pkgsrc Source Tree

   Before you can install pkgsrc packages from source, you must first obtain
   the pkgsrc source tree--which is essentially a set of Makefiles, patches,
   and description files placed in /usr/pkgsrc.

   The primary method to obtain and keep your pkgsrc collection up to date is
   by using CVS

   CVS

   This is a quick method for getting the pkgsrc collection using CVS.

    1. Run cvs:

           # cd /usr/
           # cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.us.netbsd.org:/cvsroot co pkgsrc

    2. Running the following command later will download and apply all the
       recent changes to your source tree.

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc
           # cvs up

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.5.2 Installing Packages from Source

   The first thing that should be explained when it comes to the source tree
   is what is actually meant by a ``skeleton''. In a nutshell, a source
   skeleton is a minimal set of files that tell your DragonFly system how to
   cleanly compile and install a program. Each source skeleton should
   include:

     * A Makefile. The Makefile contains various statements that specify how
       the application should be compiled and where it should be installed on
       your system.

     * A distinfo file. This file contains information about the files that
       must be downloaded to build the port and their checksums, to verify
       that files have not been corrupted during the download using md5(1).

     * A files directory. This directory contains the application specific
       files that are needed for the programs appropriate run-time
       configuration.

       This directory may also contain other files used to build the port.

     * A patches directory. This directory contains patches to make the
       program compile and install on your DragonFly system. Patches are
       basically small files that specify changes to particular files. They
       are in plain text format, and basically say ``Remove line 10'' or
       ``Change line 26 to this ...''. Patches are also known as ``diffs''
       because they are generated by the diff(1) program.

     * A DESCR file. This is a more detailed, often multiple-line,
       description of the program.

     * A PLIST file. This is a list of all the files that will be installed
       by the port. It also tells the pkgsrc system what files to remove upon
       deinstallation.

   Some pkgsrc source skeletons have other files, such as MESSAGE. The pkgsrc
   system uses these files to handle special situations. If you want more
   details on these files, and on pkgsrc in general, check out The pkgsrc
   guide, available at the NetBSD website.

   Now that you have enough background information to know what the pkgsrc
   source tree is used for, you are ready to install your first compiled
   package. There are two ways this can be done, and each is explained below.

   Before we get into that, however, you will need to choose an application
   to install. There are a few ways to do this, with the easiest method being
   the pkgsrc listing on Joerg Sonnenberger's web site. You can browse
   through the packages listed there.

   Another way to find a particular source tree is by using the pkgsrc
   collection's built-in search mechanism. To use the search feature, you
   will need to be in the /usr/pkgsrc directory. Once in that directory, run
   bmake search key="program-name" where program-name is the name of the
   program you want to find. This searches packages names, comments,
   descriptions and dependencies and can be used to find packages which
   relate to a particular subject if you don't know the name of the program
   you are looking for. For example, if you were looking for apache2:

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc
 # bmake search key="apache2"
 Extracting complete dependency database.  This may take a while...

 R-deps: perl>=5.0 apr>=0.9.7.2.0.55nb2 expat>=2.0.0nb1
 Arch:   any

   The part of the output you want to pay particular attention to is the
   ``Path:'' line, since that tells you where to find the source tree for the
   requested application. The other information provided is not needed in
   order to install the package, so it will not be covered here.

   The search string is case-insensitive. Searching for ``APACHE'' will yield
   the same results as searching for ``apache''.

     Note: It should be noted that ``Extracting [the] complete dependency
     database'' does indeed take a while.

     Note: You must be logged in as root to install packages.

   Now that you have found an application you would like to install, you are
   ready to do the actual installation. The source package includes
   instructions on how to build source code, but does not include the actual
   source code. You can get the source code from a CD-ROM or from the
   Internet. Source code is distributed in whatever manner the software
   author desires. Frequently this is a tarred and gzipped file, but it might
   be compressed with some other tool or even uncompressed. The program
   source code, whatever form it comes in, is called a ``distfile''. You can
   get the distfile from a CD-ROM or from the Internet.

     Warning: Before installing any application, you should be sure to have
     an up-to-date source tree and you should check http://www.pkgsrc.org/
     for security issues related to your port.

     A security vulnerabilities check can be automatically done by
     audit-packages before any new application installation. This tool can be
     found in the pkgsrc collection (security/audit-packages). Consider
     running auditpackages -d before installing a new package, to fetch the
     current vulnerabilities database. A security audit and an update of the
     database will be performed during the daily security system check. For
     more informations read the audit-packages and periodic(8) manual pages.

     Note: It should be noted that the current setup of DragonFly requires
     the use of bmake instead of make. This is because the current version of
     make on DragonFly does not support all the parameters that NetBSD's
     does.

     Note: You can save an extra step by just running bmake install instead
     of bmake and bmake install as two separate steps.

     Note: Some shells keep a cache of the commands that are available in the
     directories listed in the PATH environment variable, to speed up lookup
     operations for the executable file of these commands. If you are using
     one of these shells, you might have to use the rehash command after
     installing a package, before the newly installed commands can be used.
     This is true for both shells that are part of the base-system (such as
     tcsh) and shells that are available as packages (for instance,
     shells/zsh).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    4.5.2.1 Installing Packages from the Internet

   As with the last section, this section makes an assumption that you have a
   working Internet connection. If you do not, you will need to put a copy of
   the distfile into /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles manually.

   Installing a package from the Internet is done exactly the same way as it
   would be if you already had the distfile. The only difference between the
   two is that the distfile is downloaded from the Internet on demand.

   Here are the steps involved:

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc/chat/ircII
         # bmake install clean

 #

   As you can see, the only difference are the lines that tell you where the
   system is fetching the package's distfile from.

   The pkgsrc system uses ftp(1) to download the files, which honors various
   environment variables, including FTP_PASSIVE_MODE, FTP_PROXY, and
   FTP_PASSWORD. You may need to set one or more of these if you are behind a
   firewall, or need to use an FTP/HTTP proxy. See ftp(1) for the complete
   list.

   For users which cannot be connected all the time, the bmake fetch option
   is provided. Just run this command at the top level directory
   (/usr/pkgsrc) and the required files will be downloaded for you. This
   command will also work in the lower level categories, for example:
   /usr/pkgsrc/net. Note that if a package depends on libraries or other
   packages this will not fetch the distfiles of those packages as well.

     Note: You can build all the packages in a category or as a whole by
     running bmake in the top level directory, just like the aforementioned
     bmake fetch method. This is dangerous, however, as some applications
     cannot co-exist. In other cases, some packages can install two different
     files with the same filename.

   In some rare cases, users may need to acquire the tarballs from a site
   other than the MASTER_SITES (the location where files are downloaded
   from). You can override the MASTER_SORT, MASTER_SORT_REGEX and
   INET_COUNTRY options either within the /etc/mk.conf.

     Note: Some packages allow (or even require) you to provide build options
     which can enable/disable parts of the application which are unneeded,
     certain security options, and other customizations. A few which come to
     mind are www/mozilla, security/gpgme, and mail/sylpheed-claws. To find
     out what build options the application you are installing requires type:

 # bmake show-options

     To change the build process, either change the values of
     PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS or PKG_OPTIONS.PackageName in /etc/mk.conf or on the
     commandline as so:

 # bmake PKG_OPTIONS.ircII="-ssl"

     An option is enabled if listed. It is disabled if it is prefixed by a
     minus sign.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    4.5.2.2 Dealing with imake

   Some applications that use imake (a part of the X Window System) do not
   work well with PREFIX, and will insist on installing under /usr/X11R6.
   Similarly, some Perl ports ignore PREFIX and install in the Perl tree.
   Making these applications respect PREFIX is a difficult or impossible job.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.5.3 Removing Installed Packages

   Now that you know how to install packages, you are probably wondering how
   to remove them, just in case you install one and later on decide that you
   installed the wrong program. We will remove our previous example (which
   was ircII for those of you not paying attention). As with installing
   packages, the first thing you must do is change to the package directory,
   /usr/pkgsrc/chat/ircII. After you change directories, you are ready to
   uninstall ircII. This is done with the bmake deinstall command:

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc/chat/ircII
 # make deinstall
 ===>  Deinstalling for ircII-20040820

   That was easy enough. You have removed ircII from your system. If you
   would like to reinstall it, you can do so by running bmake reinstall from
   the /usr/ports/chat/ircII directory.

   The bmake deinstall and bmake reinstall sequence does not work once you
   have run bmake clean. If you want to deinstall a package after cleaning,
   use pkg_delete(1) as discussed in the Pkgsrc section of the Handbook.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.5.4 Packages and Disk Space

   Using the pkgsrc collection can definitely eat up your disk space. For
   this reason you should always remember to clean up the work directories
   using the bmake clean option. This will remove the work directory after a
   package has been built, and installed. You can also remove the tar files
   from the distfiles directory, and remove the installed package when their
   use has delimited.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.5.5 Upgrading Packages

     Note: Once you have updated your pkgsrc collection, before attempting a
     package upgrade, you should check the /usr/pkgsrc/UPDATING file. This
     file describes various issues and additional steps users may encounter
     and need to perform when updating a port.

   Keeping your packages up to date can be a tedious job. For instance, to
   upgrade a package you would go to the package directory, build the
   package, deinstall the old package , install the new package, and then
   clean up after the build. Imagine doing that for five packages, tedious
   right? This was a large problem for system administrators to deal with,
   and now we have utilities which do this for us. For instance the pkg_chk
   utility will do everything for you!

   pkg_chk requires a few steps in order to work correctly. They are listed
   here.

 # pkg_chk -g # make initial list of installed packages
         # pkg_chk -r  # remove all packages that are not up to date and packages that depend on them
         # pkg_chk -a  # install all missing packages (use binary packages, this is the default)
         # pkg_chk -as # install all missing packages (build from source)
        

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6 Post-installation Activities

   After installing a new application you will normally want to read any
   documentation it may have included, edit any configuration files that are
   required, ensure that the application starts at boot time (if it is a
   daemon), and so on.

   The exact steps you need to take to configure each application will
   obviously be different. However, if you have just installed a new
   application and are wondering ``What now?'' these tips might help:

     * Use pkg_info(1) to find out which files were installed, and where. For
       example, if you have just installed FooPackage version 1.0.0, then
       this command

 # pkg_info -L foopackage-1.0.0 | less

       will show all the files installed by the package. Pay special
       attention to files in man/ directories, which will be manual pages,
       etc/ directories, which will be configuration files, and doc/, which
       will be more comprehensive documentation.

       If you are not sure which version of the application was just
       installed, a command like this

 # pkg_info | grep -i foopackage

       will find all the installed packages that have foopackage in the
       package name. Replace foopackage in your command line as necessary.

     * Once you have identified where the application's manual pages have
       been installed, review them using man(1). Similarly, look over the
       sample configuration files, and any additional documentation that may
       have been provided.

     * If the application has a web site, check it for additional
       documentation, frequently asked questions, and so forth. If you are
       not sure of the web site address it may be listed in the output from

 # pkg_info foopackage-1.0.0

       A WWW: line, if present, should provide a URL for the application's
       web site.

     * Packages that should start at boot (such as Internet servers) will
       usually install a sample script in /usr/pkg/etc/rc.d. You should
       review this script for correctness and edit or rename it if needed.
       See Starting Services for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.7 Dealing with Broken Packages

   If you come across a package that does not work for you, there are a few
   things you can do, including:

    1. Fix it! The pkgsrc Guide includes detailed information on the
       ``pkgsrc'' infrastructure so that you can fix the occasional broken
       package or even submit your own!

    2. Gripe--by email only! Send email to the maintainer of the package
       first. Type bmake maintainer or read the Makefile to find the
       maintainer's email address. Remember to include the name and version
       of the port (send the $NetBSD: line from the Makefile) and the output
       leading up to the error when you email the maintainer. If you do not
       get a response from the maintainer, you can try users .

    3. Grab the package from an FTP site near you. The ``master'' package
       collection is on packages.stura.uni-rostock.de in the All directory.
       These are more likely to work than trying to compile from source and
       are a lot faster as well. Use the pkg_add(1) program to install the
       package on your system.

                         Chapter 5 The X Window System

5.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly uses XFree86 to provide users with a powerful graphical user
   interface. XFree86 is an open-source implementation of the X Window
   System. This chapter will cover installation and configuration of XFree86
   on a DragonFly system. For more information on XFree86 and video hardware
   that it supports, check the XFree86 web site.

     Warning: This chapter contains a number of outdated references to the
     FreeBSD ports collection. Most instructions still apply to pkgsrc, but
     proceed with caution until this chapter is updated.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

5.2 Understanding X

   Using X for the first time can be somewhat of a shock to someone familiar
   with other graphical environments, such as Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.

   It is not necessary to understand all of the details of various X
   components and how they interact; however, some basic knowledge makes it
   possible to take advantage of X's strengths.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.2.1 Why X?

   X is not the first window system written for UNIX, but it is the most
   popular. X's original development team had worked on another window system
   before writing X. That system's name was ``W'' (for ``Window''). X is just
   the next letter in the Roman alphabet.

   X can be called ``X'', ``X Window System'', ``X11'', and other terms.
   Calling X11 ``X Windows'' can offend some people; see X(7) for a bit more
   insight on this.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.2.2 The X Client/Server Model

   X was designed from the beginning to be network-centric, and adopts a
   ``client-server'' model. In the X model, the ``X server'' runs on the
   computer that has the keyboard, monitor, and mouse attached. The server is
   responsible for managing the display, handling input from the keyboard and
   mouse, and so on. Each X application (such as XTerm, or Netscape) is a
   ``client''. A client sends messages to the server such as ``Please draw a
   window at these coordinates'', and the server sends back messages such as
   ``The user just clicked on the OK button''.

   If there is only one computer involved, such as in a home or small office
   environment, the X server and the X clients will be running on the same
   computer. However, it is perfectly possible to run the X server on a less
   powerful desktop computer, and run X applications (the clients) on, say,
   the powerful and expensive machine that serves the office. In this
   scenario the communication between the X client and server takes place
   over the network.

   This confuses some people, because the X terminology is exactly backward
   to what they expect. They expect the ``X server'' to be the big powerful
   machine down the hall, and the ``X client'' to be the machine on their
   desk.

   Remember that the X server is the machine with the monitor and keyboard,
   and the X clients are the programs that display the windows.

   There is nothing in the protocol that forces the client and server
   machines to be running the same operating system, or even to be running on
   the same type of computer. It is certainly possible to run an X server on
   Microsoft Windows or Apple's Mac OS, and there are various free and
   commercial applications available that do exactly that.

   The X server that ships with DragonFly is called XFree86, and is available
   for free, under a license very similar to the DragonFly license.
   Commercial X servers for FreeBSD are also available, and ought to work
   with DragonFly . (Unconfirmed as of this writing.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.2.3 The Window Manager

   The X design philosophy is much like the UNIX design philosophy, ``tools,
   not policy''. This means that X does not try to dictate how a task is to
   be accomplished. Instead, tools are provided to the user, and it is the
   user's responsibility to decide how to use those tools.

   This philosophy extends to X not dictating what windows should look like
   on screen, how to move them around with the mouse, what keystrokes should
   be used to move between windows (i.e., Alt+Tab, in the case of
   Microsoft Windows), what the title bars on each window should look like,
   whether or not they have close buttons on them, and so on.

   Instead, X delegates this responsibility to an application called a
   ``Window Manager''. There are dozens of window managers available for X:
   AfterStep, Blackbox, ctwm, Enlightenment, fvwm, Sawfish, twm, Window
   Maker, and more. Each of these window managers provides a different look
   and feel; some of them support ``virtual desktops''; some of them allow
   customized keystrokes to manage the desktop; some have a ``Start'' button
   or similar device; some are ``themeable'', allowing a complete change of
   look-and-feel by applying a new theme. These window managers, and many
   more, are available in the wm category of pkgsrc.

   In addition, the KDE and GNOME desktop environments both have their own
   window managers which integrate with the desktop.

   Each window manager also has a different configuration mechanism; some
   expect configuration file written by hand, others feature GUI tools for
   most of the configuration tasks; at least one (sawfish) has a
   configuration file written in a dialect of the Lisp language.

     Focus Policy: Another feature the window manager is responsible for is
     the mouse ``focus policy''. Every windowing system needs some means of
     choosing a window to be actively receiving keystrokes, and should
     visibly indicate which window is active as well.

     A familiar focus policy is called ``click-to-focus''. This is the model
     utilized by Microsoft Windows, in which a window becomes active upon
     receiving a mouse click.

     X does not support any particular focus policy. Instead, the window
     manager controls which window has the focus at any one time. Different
     window managers will support different focus methods. All of them
     support click to focus, and the majority of them support several others.

     The most popular focus policies are:

     focus-follows-mouse

             The window that is under the mouse pointer is the window that
             has the focus. This may not necessarily be the window that is on
             top of all the other windows. The focus is changed by pointing
             at another window, there is no need to click in it as well.

     sloppy-focus

             This policy is a small extension to focus-follows-mouse. With
             focus-follows-mouse, if the mouse is moved over the root window
             (or background) then no window has the focus, and keystrokes are
             simply lost. With sloppy-focus, focus is only changed when the
             cursor enters a new window, and not when exiting the current
             window.

     click-to-focus

             The active window is selected by mouse click. The window may
             then be ``raised'', and appear in front of all other windows.
             All keystrokes will now be directed to this window, even if the
             cursor is moved to another window.

     Many window managers support other policies, as well as variations on
     these. Be sure to consult the documentation for the window manager
     itself.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.2.4 Widgets

   The X approach of providing tools and not policy extends to the widgets
   seen on screen in each application.

   ``Widget'' is a term for all the items in the user interface that can be
   clicked or manipulated in some way; buttons, check boxes, radio buttons,
   icons, lists, and so on. Microsoft Windows calls these ``controls''.

   Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS both have a very rigid widget policy.
   Application developers are supposed to ensure that their applications
   share a common look and feel. With X, it was not considered sensible to
   mandate a particular graphical style, or set of widgets to adhere to.

   As a result, do not expect X applications to have a common look and feel.
   There are several popular widget sets and variations, including the
   original Athena widget set from MIT, Motif(R) (on which the widget set in
   Microsoft Windows was modeled, all bevelled edges and three shades of
   grey), OpenLook, and others.

   Most newer X applications today will use a modern-looking widget set,
   either Qt, used by KDE, or GTK, used by the GNOME project. In this
   respect, there is some convergence in look-and-feel of the UNIX desktop,
   which certainly makes things easier for the novice user.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3 Installing XFree86(TM)

     Warning: This section is out of date; please consult the DragonFly BSD
     wiki or mailing lists for recent discussion.

   A binary package to use with pkg_add(1) tool is also available for XFree86
   4.X. When the remote fetching feature of pkg_add(1) is used, the version
   number of the package must be removed. pkg_add(1) will automatically fetch
   the latest version of the application. So to fetch and install the package
   of XFree86 4.X, simply type:

 # pkg_add XFree86

   You can also use the ports collection to install XFree86 4.X, for that you
   simply need to type the following commands:

 # cd /usr/ports/x11/XFree86-4
 # make install clean

     Note: The examples above will install the complete XFree86 distribution
     including the servers, clients, fonts etc. Separate packages for
     different parts of XFree86 4.X are also available.

   The rest of this chapter will explain how to configure XFree86, and how to
   set up a productive desktop environment.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.4 XFree86 Configuration

   Contributed by Christopher Shumway.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.4.1 Before Starting

   Before configuration of XFree86 4.X, the following information about the
   target system is needed:

     * Monitor specifications

     * Video Adapter chipset

     * Video Adapter memory

   The specifications for the monitor are used by XFree86 to determine the
   resolution and refresh rate to run at. These specifications can usually be
   obtained from the documentation that came with the monitor or from the
   manufacturer's website. There are two ranges of numbers that are needed,
   the horizontal scan rate and the vertical synchronization rate.

   The video adapter's chipset defines what driver module XFree86 uses to
   talk to the graphics hardware. With most chipsets, this can be
   automatically determined, but it is still useful to know in case the
   automatic detection does not work correctly.

   Video memory on the graphic adapter determines the resolution and color
   depth which the system can run at. This is important to know so the user
   knows the limitations of the system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.4.2 Configuring XFree86 4.X

   Configuration of XFree86 4.X is a multi-step process. The first step is to
   build an initial configuration file with the -configure option to XFree86.
   As the super user, simply run:

 # XFree86 -configure

   This will generate a skeleton XFree86 configuration file in the /root
   directory called XF86Config.new (in fact the directory used is the one
   covered by the environment variable $HOME, and it will depend from the way
   you got the superuser rights). The XFree86 program will attempt to probe
   the graphics hardware on the system and will write a configuration file to
   load the proper drivers for the detected hardware on the target system.

   The next step is to test the existing configuration to verify that XFree86
   can work with the graphics hardware on the target system. To perform this
   task, the user needs to run:

 # XFree86 -xf86config XF86Config.new

   If a black and grey grid and an X mouse cursor appear, the configuration
   was successful. To exit the test, just press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
   simultaneously.

     Note: If the mouse does not work, be sure the device has been
     configured. See moused(8) for more information

   Next, tune the XF86Config.new configuration file to taste. Open the file
   in a text editor such as emacs(1) or ee(1). First, add the frequencies for
   the target system's monitor. These are usually expressed as a horizontal
   and vertical synchronization rate. These values are added to the
   XF86Config.new file under the "Monitor" section:

 Section "Monitor"
         Identifier   "Monitor0"
         VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
         ModelName    "Monitor Model"
         HorizSync    30-107
         VertRefresh  48-120
 EndSection

   The HorizSync and VertRefresh keywords may not exist in the configuration
   file. If they do not, they need to be added, with the correct horizontal
   synchronization rate placed after the HorizSync keyword and the vertical
   synchronization rate after the VertRefresh keyword. In the example above
   the target monitor's rates were entered.

   X allows DPMS (Energy Star) features to be used with capable monitors. The
   xset(1) program controls the time-outs and can force standby, suspend, or
   off modes. If you wish to enable DPMS features for your monitor, you must
   add the following line to the monitor section:

         Option       "DPMS"

   While the XF86Config.new configuration file is still open in an editor,
   select the default resolution and color depth desired. This is defined in
   the "Screen" section:

 Section "Screen"
         Identifier "Screen0"
         Device     "Card0"
         Monitor    "Monitor0"
         DefaultDepth 24
         SubSection "Display"
                 Depth     24
                 Modes     "1024x768"
         EndSubSection
 EndSection

   The DefaultDepth keyword describes the color depth to run at by default.
   This can be overridden with the -bpp command line switch to XFree86(1).
   The Modes keyword describes the resolution to run at for the given color
   depth. Note that only VESA standard modes are supported as defined by the
   target system's graphics hardware. In the example above, the default color
   depth is twenty-four bits per pixel. At this color depth, the accepted
   resolution is one thousand twenty-four pixels by seven hundred and
   sixty-eight pixels.

   Finally, write the configuration file and test it using the test mode
   given above. If all is well, the configuration file needs to be installed
   in a common location where XFree86(1) can find it. This is typically
   /etc/X11/XF86Config or /usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config.

 # cp XF86Config.new /etc/X11/XF86Config

   Once the configuration file has been placed in a common location,
   configuration is complete. In order to start XFree86 4.X with startx(1),
   install the x11/wrapper port. XFree86 4.X can also be started with xdm(1).

     Note: There is also a graphical tool for configuration, xf86cfg(1), that
     comes with the XFree86 4.X distribution. It allows to interactively
     define your configuration by choosing the appropriate drivers and
     settings. This program can be used under console as well, just use the
     command xf86cfg -textmode. For more details, refer to the xf86cfg(1)
     manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.4.3 Advanced Configuration Topics

    5.4.3.1 Configuration with Intel(R) i810 Graphics Chipsets

   Configuration with Intel(R) i810 integrated chipsets requires the agpgart
   AGP programming interface for XFree86 to drive the card. The agp(4) driver
   is in the GENERIC kernel since releases 4.8-RELEASE and 5.0-RELEASE. On
   prior releases, you will have to add the following line:

 device agp

   in your kernel configuration file and rebuild a new kernel. Instead, you
   may want to load the agp.ko kernel module automatically with the loader(8)
   at boot time. For that, simply add this line to /boot/loader.conf:

 agp_load="YES"

   Next, a device node needs to be created for the programming interface. To
   create the AGP device node, run MAKEDEV(8) in the /dev directory:

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV agpgart

   This will allow configuration of the hardware as any other graphics board.
   Note on systems without the agp(4) driver compiled in the kernel, trying
   to load the module with kldload(8) will not work. This driver has to be in
   the kernel at boot time through being compiled in or using
   /boot/loader.conf.

   If you are using XFree86 4.1.0 (or later) and messages about unresolved
   symbols like fbPictureInit appear, try adding the following line after
   Driver "i810" in the XFree86 configuration file:

 Option "NoDDC"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.5 Using Fonts in XFree86

   Contributed by Murray Stokely.

  5.5.1 Type1 Fonts

   The default fonts that ship with XFree86 are less than ideal for typical
   desktop publishing applications. Large presentation fonts show up jagged
   and unprofessional looking, and small fonts in Netscape are almost
   completely unintelligible. However, there are several free, high quality
   Type1 (PostScript(R)) fonts available which can be readily used with
   XFree86, either version 3.X or version 4.X. For instance, the URW font
   collection (x11-fonts/urwfonts) includes high quality versions of standard
   type1 fonts (Times Roman(R), Helvetica(R), Palatino(R) and others). The
   Freefonts collection (x11-fonts/freefonts) includes many more fonts, but
   most of them are intended for use in graphics software such as the Gimp,
   and are not complete enough to serve as screen fonts. In addition, XFree86
   can be configured to use TrueType fonts with a minimum of effort: see the
   section on TrueType fonts later.

   To install the above Type1 font collections from the ports collection, run
   the following commands:

 # cd /usr/ports/x11-fonts/urwfonts
 # make install clean

   And likewise with the freefont or other collections. To tell the X server
   that these fonts exist, add an appropriate line to the XF86Config file (in
   /etc/ for XFree86 version 3, or in /etc/X11/ for version 4), which reads:

 FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/URW/"

   Alternatively, at the command line in the X session run:

 % xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/URW
 % xset fp rehash

   This will work but will be lost when the X session is closed, unless it is
   added to the startup file (~/.xinitrc for a normal startx session, or
   ~/.xsession when logging in through a graphical login manager like XDM). A
   third way is to use the new XftConfig file: see the section on
   anti-aliasing.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.5.2 TrueType(R) Fonts

   XFree86 4.X has built in support for rendering TrueType fonts. There are
   two different modules that can enable this functionality. The freetype
   module is used in this example because it is more consistent with the
   other font rendering back-ends. To enable the freetype module just add the
   following line to the "Module" section of the /etc/X11/XF86Config file.

 Load  "freetype"

   For XFree86 3.3.X, a separate TrueType font server is needed. Xfstt is
   commonly used for this purpose. To install Xfstt, simply install the port
   x11-servers/Xfstt.

   Now make a directory for the TrueType fonts (for example,
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType) and copy all of the TrueType fonts into
   this directory. Keep in mind that TrueType fonts cannot be directly taken
   from a Macintosh(R); they must be in UNIX/DOS/Windows format for use by
   XFree86. Once the files have been copied into this directory, use ttmkfdir
   to create a fonts.dir file, so that the X font renderer knows that these
   new files have been installed. ttmkfdir is available from the FreeBSD
   Ports Collection as x11-fonts/ttmkfdir or the pkgsrc collection at
   fonts/ttmkfdir2.

 # cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
 # ttmkfdir > fonts.dir

   Now add the TrueType directory to the font path. This is just the same as
   described above for Type1 fonts, that is, use

 % xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
 % xset fp rehash

   or add a FontPath line to the XF86Config file.

   That's it. Now Netscape, Gimp, StarOffice(TM), and all of the other X
   applications should now recognize the installed TrueType fonts. Extremely
   small fonts (as with text in a high resolution display on a web page) and
   extremely large fonts (within StarOffice) will look much better now.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.5.3 Anti-Aliased Fonts

   Updated for XFree86 4.3 by Joe Marcus Clarke.

   Anti-aliasing has been available in XFree86 since 4.0.2. However, font
   configuration was cumbersome before the introduction of XFree86 4.3.0.
   Starting in version 4.3.0, all fonts in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ and
   ~/.fonts/ are automatically made available for anti-aliasing to Xft-aware
   applications. Not all applications are Xft-aware yet, but many have
   received Xft support. Examples of Xft-aware applications include Qt 2.3
   and higher (the toolkit for the KDE desktop), Gtk+ 2.0 and higher (the
   toolkit for the GNOME desktop), and Mozilla 1.2 and higher.

   In order to control which fonts are anti-aliased, or to configure
   anti-aliasing properties, create (or edit, if it already exists) the file
   /usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf. Several advanced features of the Xft font
   system can be tuned using this file; this section describes only some
   simple possibilities. For more details, please see fonts-conf(5).

   This file must be in XML format. Pay careful attention to case, and make
   sure all tags are properly closed. The file begins with the usual XML
   header followed by a DOCTYPE definition, and then the <fontconfig> tag:

       <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
       <fontconfig>
    

   As previously stated, all fonts in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ as well as
   ~/.fonts/ are already made available to Xft-aware applications. If you
   wish to add another directory outside of these two directory trees, add a
   line similar to the following to /usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf:

 <dir>/path/to/my/fonts</dir>

   After adding new fonts, and especially new font directories, you should
   run the following command to rebuild the font caches:

 # fc-cache -f

   Anti-aliasing makes borders slightly fuzzy, which makes very small text
   more readable and removes ``staircases'' from large text, but can cause
   eyestrain if applied to normal text. To exclude point sizes smaller than
   14 point from anti-aliasing, include these lines:

         <match target="font">
             <test name="size" compare="less">
                 <double>14</double>
             </test>
             <edit name="antialias" mode="assign">
                 <bool>false</bool>
             </edit>
         </match>

   Spacing for some monospaced fonts may also be inappropriate with
   anti-aliasing. This seems to be an issue with KDE, in particular. One
   possible fix for this is to force the spacing for such fonts to be 100.
   Add the following lines:

        <match target="pattern" name="family">
            <test qual="any" name="family">
                <string>fixed</string>
            </test>
            <edit name="family" mode="assign">
                <string>mono</string>
            </edit>
         </match>
         <match target="pattern" name="family">
             <test qual="any" name="family">
                 <string>console</string>
             </test>
             <edit name="family" mode="assign">
                 <string>mono</string>
             </edit>
         </match>

   (this aliases the other common names for fixed fonts as "mono"), and then
   add:

          <match target="pattern" name="family">
              <test qual="any" name="family">
                  <string>mono</string>
              </test>
              <edit name="spacing" mode="assign">
                  <int>100</int>
              </edit>
          </match>     

   Certain fonts, such as Helvetica, may have a problem when anti-aliased.
   Usually this manifests itself as a font that seems cut in half vertically.
   At worst, it may cause applications such as Mozilla to crash. To avoid
   this, consider adding the following to local.conf:

          <match target="pattern" name="family">
              <test qual="any" name="family">
                  <string>Helvetica</string>
              </test>
              <edit name="family" mode="assign">
                  <string>sans-serif</string>
              </edit>
          </match>       

   Once you have finished editing local.conf make sure you end the file with
   the </fontconfig> tag. Not doing this will cause your changes to be
   ignored.

   The default font set that comes with XFree86 is not very desirable when it
   comes to anti-aliasing. A much better set of default fonts can be found in
   the x11-fonts/bitstream-vera port. This port will install a
   /usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf file if one does not exist already. If the
   file does exist, the port will create a
   /usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf-vera file. Merge the contents of this file
   into /usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf, and the Bitstream fonts will
   automatically replace the default XFree86 Serif, Sans Serif, and
   Monospaced fonts.

   Finally, users can add their own settings via their personal .fonts.conf
   files. To do this, each user should simply create a ~/.fonts.conf. This
   file must also be in XML format.

   One last point: with an LCD screen, sub-pixel sampling may be desired.
   This basically treats the (horizontally separated) red, green and blue
   components separately to improve the horizontal resolution; the results
   can be dramatic. To enable this, add the line somewhere in the local.conf
   file:

          <match target="font">
              <test qual="all" name="rgba">
                  <const>unknown</const>
              </test>
              <edit name="rgba" mode="assign">
                  <const>rgb</const>
              </edit>
          </match>
       

     Note: Depending on the sort of display, rgb may need to be changed to
     bgr, vrgb or vbgr: experiment and see which works best.

   Anti-aliasing should be enabled the next time the X server is started.
   However, programs must know how to take advantage of it. At present, the
   Qt toolkit does, so the entire KDE environment can use anti-aliased fonts
   (see Section 5.7.3.2 on KDE for details). Gtk+ and GNOME can also be made
   to use anti-aliasing via the ``Font'' capplet (see Section 5.7.1.3 for
   details). By default, Mozilla 1.2 and greater will automatically use
   anti-aliasing. To disable this, rebuild Mozilla with the -DWITHOUT_XFT
   flag.

5.6 The X Display Manager

   Contributed by Seth Kingsley.

  5.6.1 Overview

   The X Display Manager (XDM) is an optional part of the X Window System
   that is used for login session management. This is useful for several
   types of situations, including minimal ``X Terminals'', desktops, and
   large network display servers. Since the X Window System is network and
   protocol independent, there are a wide variety of possible configurations
   for running X clients and servers on different machines connected by a
   network. XDM provides a graphical interface for choosing which display
   server to connect to, and entering authorization information such as a
   login and password combination.

   Think of XDM as providing the same functionality to the user as the
   getty(8) utility (see Section 17.3.2 for details). That is, it performs
   system logins to the display being connected to and then runs a session
   manager on behalf of the user (usually an X window manager). XDM then
   waits for this program to exit, signaling that the user is done and should
   be logged out of the display. At this point, XDM can display the login and
   display chooser screens for the next user to login.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.6.2 Using XDM

   The XDM daemon program is located in /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm. This program can
   be run at any time as root and it will start managing the X display on the
   local machine. If XDM is to be run every time the machine boots up, a
   convenient way to do this is by adding an entry to /etc/ttys. For more
   information about the format and usage of this file, see Section 17.3.2.1.
   There is a line in the default /etc/ttys file for running the XDM daemon
   on a virtual terminal:

 ttyv8   "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"  xterm   off secure

   By default this entry is disabled; in order to enable it change the fifth
   field from off to on and restart init(8) using the directions in Section
   17.3.2.2. The first field, the name of the terminal this program will
   manage, is ttyv8. This means that XDM will start running on the 9th
   virtual terminal.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.6.3 Configuring XDM

   The XDM configuration directory is located in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm. In
   this directory there are several files used to change the behavior and
   appearance of XDM. Typically these files will be found:

      File                             Description                           
   Xaccess    Client authorization ruleset.                                  
   Xresources Default X resource values.                                     
   Xservers   List of remote and local displays to manage.                   
   Xsession   Default session script for logins.                             
   Xsetup_*   Script to launch applications before the login interface.      
   xdm-config Global configuration for all displays running on this machine. 
   xdm-errors Errors generated by the server program.                        
   xdm-pid    The process ID of the currently running XDM.                   

   Also in this directory are a few scripts and programs used to set up the
   desktop when XDM is running. The purpose of each of these files will be
   briefly described. The exact syntax and usage of all of these files is
   described in xdm(1).

   The default configuration is a simple rectangular login window with the
   hostname of the machine displayed at the top in a large font and
   ``Login:'' and ``Password:'' prompts below. This is a good starting point
   for changing the look and feel of XDM screens.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.1 Xaccess

   The protocol for connecting to XDM controlled displays is called the X
   Display Manager Connection Protocol (XDMCP). This file is a ruleset for
   controlling XDMCP connections from remote machines. By default, it allows
   any client to connect, but that does not matter unless the xdm-config is
   changed to listen for remote connections.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.2 Xresources

   This is an application-defaults file for the display chooser and the login
   screens. This is where the appearance of the login program can be
   modified. The format is identical to the app-defaults file described in
   the XFree86 documentation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.3 Xservers

   This is a list of the remote displays the chooser should provide as
   choices.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.4 Xsession

   This is the default session script for XDM to run after a user has logged
   in. Normally each user will have a customized session script in
   ~/.xsession that overrides this script.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.5 Xsetup_*

   These will be run automatically before displaying the chooser or login
   interfaces. There is a script for each display being used, named Xsetup_
   followed by the local display number (for instance Xsetup_0). Typically
   these scripts will run one or two programs in the background such as
   xconsole.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.6 xdm-config

   This contains settings in the form of app-defaults that are applicable to
   every display that this installation manages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.6.3.7 xdm-errors

   This contains the output of the X servers that XDM is trying to run. If a
   display that XDM is trying to start hangs for some reason, this is a good
   place to look for error messages. These messages are also written to the
   user's ~/.xsession-errors file on a per-session basis.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.6.4 Running a Network Display Server

   In order for other clients to connect to the display server, edit the
   access control rules, and enable the connection listener. By default these
   are set to conservative values. To make XDM listen for connections, first
   comment out a line in the xdm-config file:

 ! SECURITY: do not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests
 ! Comment out this line if you want to manage X terminals with xdm
 DisplayManager.requestPort:     0

   and then restart XDM. Remember that comments in app-defaults files begin
   with a ``!'' character, not the usual ``#''. More strict access controls
   may be desired. Look at the example entries in Xaccess, and refer to the
   xdm(1) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.6.5 Replacements for XDM

   Several replacements for the default XDM program exist. One of them, KDM
   (bundled with KDE) is described later in this chapter. KDM offers many
   visual improvements and cosmetic frills, as well as the functionality to
   allow users to choose their window manager of choice at login time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.7 Desktop Environments

   Contributed by Valentino Vaschetto.

   This section describes the different desktop environments available for X
   on DragonFly . A ``desktop environment'' can mean anything ranging from a
   simple window manager to a complete suite of desktop applications, such as
   KDE or GNOME.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.7.1 GNOME

    5.7.1.1 About GNOME

   GNOME is a user-friendly desktop environment that enables users to easily
   use and configure their computers. GNOME includes a panel (for starting
   applications and displaying status), a desktop (where data and
   applications can be placed), a set of standard desktop tools and
   applications, and a set of conventions that make it easy for applications
   to cooperate and be consistent with each other. Users of other operating
   systems or environments should feel right at home using the powerful
   graphics-driven environment that GNOME provides.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.1.2 Installing GNOME

   The easiest way to install GNOME is with a package or through the ports
   collection:

   To install the GNOME package from the network, simply type:

 # pkg_add gnome

   To build GNOME from source, use the ports tree:

 # cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
 # make install clean

   Once GNOME is installed, the X server must be told to start GNOME instead
   of a default window manager. If a custom .xinitrc is already in place,
   simply replace the line that starts the current window manager with one
   that starts /usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session instead. If nothing special has
   been done to configuration file, then it is enough to simply type:

 % echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc

   Next, type startx, and the GNOME desktop environment will be started.

     Note: If a display manager, like XDM, is being used, this will not work.
     Instead, create an executable .xsession file with the same command in
     it. To do this, edit the file and replace the existing window manager
     command with /usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session:

 % echo "#!/bin/sh" > ~/.xsession
 % echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session" >> ~/.xsession
 % chmod +x ~/.xsession

   Another option is to configure the display manager to allow choosing the
   window manager at login time; the section on KDE details explains how to
   do this for kdm, the display manager of KDE.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.1.3 Anti-aliased Fonts with GNOME

   Starting with version 4.0.2, XFree86 supports anti-aliasing via its
   ``RENDER'' extension. Gtk+ 2.0 and greater (the toolkit used by GNOME) can
   make use of this functionality. Configuring anti-aliasing is described in
   Section 5.5.3. So, with up-to-date software, anti-aliasing is possible
   within the GNOME desktop. Just go to Applications->Desktop
   Preferences->Font, and select either Best shapes, Best contrast, or
   Subpixel smoothing (LCDs). For a Gtk+ application that is not part of the
   GNOME desktop, set the environment variable GDK_USE_XFT to 1 before
   launching the program.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.7.2 KDE

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.2.1 About KDE

   KDE is an easy to use contemporary desktop environment. Some of the things
   that KDE brings to the user are:

     * A beautiful contemporary desktop

     * A desktop exhibiting complete network transparency

     * An integrated help system allowing for convenient, consistent access
       to help on the use of the KDE desktop and its applications

     * Consistent look and feel of all KDE applications

     * Standardized menu and toolbars, keybindings, color-schemes, etc.

     * Internationalization: KDE is available in more than 40 languages

     * Centralized consisted dialog driven desktop configuration

     * A great number of useful KDE applications

   KDE has an office application suite based on KDE's ``KParts'' technology
   consisting of a spread-sheet, a presentation application, an organizer, a
   news client and more. KDE also comes with a web browser called Konqueror,
   which represents a solid competitor to other existing web browsers on UNIX
   systems. More information on KDE can be found on the KDE website.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.2.2 Installing KDE

   Just as with GNOME or any other desktop environment, the easiest way to
   install KDE is from a package or from the ports collection:

   To install the KDE package from the network, simply type:

 # pkg_add kde3

   pkg_add(1) will automatically fetch the latest version of the application.

   To build KDE from source, use the ports tree:

 # cd /usr/ports/x11/kde3
 # make install clean

   After KDE has been installed, the X server must be told to launch this
   application instead of the default window manager. This is accomplished by
   editing the .xinitrc file:

 % echo "exec startkde" > ~/.xinitrc

   Now, whenever the X Window System is invoked with startx, KDE will be the
   desktop.

   If a display manager such as xdm is being used, the configuration is
   slightly different. Edit the .xsession file instead. Instructions for kdm
   are described later in this chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.7.3 More Details on KDE

   Now that KDE is installed on the system, most things can be discovered
   through the help pages, or just by pointing and clicking at various menus.
   Windows or Mac(R) users will feel quite at home.

   The best reference for KDE is the on-line documentation. KDE comes with
   its own web browser, Konqueror, dozens of useful applications, and
   extensive documentation. The remainder of this section discusses the
   technical items that are difficult to learn by random exploration.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.3.1 The KDE Display Manager

   An administrator of a multi-user system may wish to have a graphical login
   screen to welcome users. xdm can be used, as described earlier. However,
   KDE includes an alternative, kdm, which is designed to look more
   attractive and include more login-time options. In particular, users can
   easily choose (via a menu) which desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, or
   something else) to run after logging on.

   To begin with, run the KDE control panel, kcontrol, as root. It is
   generally considered unsafe to run the entire X environment as root.
   Instead, run the window manager as a normal user, open a terminal window
   (such as xterm or KDE's konsole), become root with su (the user must be in
   the wheel group in /etc/group for this), and then type kcontrol.

   Click on the icon on the left marked System, then on Login manager. On the
   right there are various configurable options, which the KDE manual will
   explain in greater detail. Click on sessions on the right. Click New type
   to add various window managers and desktop environments. These are just
   labels, so they can say KDE and GNOME rather than startkde or
   gnome-session. Include a label failsafe.

   Play with the other menus as well, they are mainly cosmetic and
   self-explanatory. When you are done, click on Apply at the bottom, and
   quit the control center.

   To make sure kdm understands what the labels (KDE, GNOME etc) mean, edit
   the files used by xdm.

     Note: In KDE 2.2 this has changed: kdm now uses its own configuration
     files. Please see the KDE 2.2 documentation for details.

   In a terminal window, as root, edit the file
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession. There is a section in the middle like
   this:

 case $# in
 1)
         case $1 in
         failsafe)
                 exec xterm -geometry 80x24-0-0
                 ;;
         esac
 esac

   A few lines need to be added to this section. Assuming the labels from
   used were ``KDE'' and ``GNOME'', use the following:

 case $# in
 1)
         case $1 in
         kde)
                 exec /usr/local/bin/startkde
                 ;;
         GNOME)
                 exec /usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session
                 ;;
         failsafe)
                 exec xterm -geometry 80x24-0-0
                 ;;
         esac
 esac

   For the KDE login-time desktop background to be honored, the following
   line needs to be added to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0:

 /usr/local/bin/kdmdesktop

   Now, make sure kdm is listed in /etc/ttys to be started at the next
   bootup. To do this, simply follow the instructions from the previous
   section on xdm and replace references to the /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm program
   with /usr/local/bin/kdm.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.3.2 Anti-aliased Fonts

   Starting with version 4.0.2, XFree86 supports anti-aliasing via its
   ``RENDER'' extension, and starting with version 2.3, Qt (the toolkit used
   by KDE) supports this extension. Configuring this is described in Section
   5.5.3 on antialiasing X11 fonts. So, with up-to-date software,
   anti-aliasing is possible on a KDE desktop. Just go to the KDE menu, go to
   Preferences->Look and Feel->Fonts, and click on the check box Use
   Anti-Aliasing for Fonts and Icons. For a Qt application which is not part
   of KDE, the environment variable QT_XFT needs to be set to true before
   starting the program.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  5.7.4 XFce

    5.7.4.1 About XFce

   XFce is a desktop environment based on the GTK toolkit used by GNOME, but
   is much more lightweight and meant for those who want a simple, efficient
   desktop which is nevertheless easy to use and configure. Visually, it
   looks very much like CDE, found on commercial UNIX systems. Some of XFce's
   features are:

     * A simple, easy-to-handle desktop

     * Fully configurable via mouse, with drag and drop, etc

     * Main panel similar to CDE, with menus, applets and applications
       launchers

     * Integrated window manager, file manager, sound manager, GNOME
       compliance module, and other things

     * Themeable (since it uses GTK)

     * Fast, light and efficient: ideal for older/slower machines or machines
       with memory limitations

   More information on XFce can be found on the XFce website.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    5.7.4.2 Installing XFce

   A binary package for XFce exists (at the time of writing). To install,
   simply type:

 # pkg_add xfce4

   Alternatively, to build from source, use the ports collection:

 # cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/xfce4
 # make install clean

   Now, tell the X server to launch XFce the next time X is started. Simply
   type this:

 % echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/startxfce4" > ~/.xinitrc

   The next time X is started, XFce will be the desktop. As before, if a
   display manager like xdm is being used, create an .xsession, as described
   in the section on GNOME, but with the /usr/X11R6/bin/startxfce4 command;
   or, configure the display manager to allow choosing a desktop at login
   time, as explained in the section on kdm.

                           II. System Administration

   The remaining chapters of the DragonFly Handbook cover all aspects of
   DragonFly system administration. Each chapter starts by describing what
   you will learn as a result of reading the chapter, and also details what
   you are expected to know before tackling the material.

   These chapters are designed to be read when you need the information. You
   do not have to read them in any particular order, nor do you need to read
   all of them before you can begin using DragonFly.

                       Chapter 6 Configuration and Tuning

   Written by Chern Lee. Based on a tutorial written by Mike Smith. Also
   based on tuning(7) written by Matt Dillon.

6.1 Synopsis

   One of the important aspects of DragonFly is system configuration. Correct
   system configuration will help prevent headaches during future upgrades.
   This chapter will explain much of the DragonFly configuration process,
   including some of the parameters which can be set to tune a DragonFly
   system.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to efficiently work with file systems and swap partitions.

     * The basics of rc.conf configuration and rc.d startup systems.

     * How to configure and test a network card.

     * How to configure virtual hosts on your network devices.

     * How to use the various configuration files in /etc.

     * How to tune DragonFly using sysctl variables.

     * How to tune disk performance and modify kernel limitations.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Understand UNIX and DragonFly basics (Chapter 3).

     * Be familiar with the basics of kernel configuration/compilation
       (Chapter 9).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2 Initial Configuration

  6.2.1 Partition Layout

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2.1.1 Base Partitions

   When laying out file systems with disklabel(8) remember that hard drives
   transfer data faster from the outer tracks to the inner. Thus smaller and
   heavier-accessed file systems should be closer to the outside of the
   drive, while larger partitions like /usr should be placed toward the
   inner. It is a good idea to create partitions in a similar order to: root,
   swap, /var, /usr.

   The size of /var reflects the intended machine usage. /var is used to hold
   mailboxes, log files, and printer spools. Mailboxes and log files can grow
   to unexpected sizes depending on how many users exist and how long log
   files are kept. Most users would never require a gigabyte, but remember
   that /var/tmp must be large enough to contain packages.

   The /usr partition holds much of the files required to support the system,
   the pkgsrc collection (recommended) and the source code (optional). At
   least 2 gigabytes would be recommended for this partition.

   When selecting partition sizes, keep the space requirements in mind.
   Running out of space in one partition while barely using another can be a
   hassle.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2.1.2 Swap Partition

   As a rule of thumb, the swap partition should be about double the size of
   system memory (RAM). For example, if the machine has 128 megabytes of
   memory, the swap file should be 256 megabytes. Systems with less memory
   may perform better with more swap. Less than 256 megabytes of swap is not
   recommended and memory expansion should be considered. The kernel's VM
   paging algorithms are tuned to perform best when the swap partition is at
   least two times the size of main memory. Configuring too little swap can
   lead to inefficiencies in the VM page scanning code and might create
   issues later if more memory is added.

   On larger systems with multiple SCSI disks (or multiple IDE disks
   operating on different controllers), it is recommend that a swap is
   configured on each drive (up to four drives). The swap partitions should
   be approximately the same size. The kernel can handle arbitrary sizes but
   internal data structures scale to 4 times the largest swap partition.
   Keeping the swap partitions near the same size will allow the kernel to
   optimally stripe swap space across disks. Large swap sizes are fine, even
   if swap is not used much. It might be easier to recover from a runaway
   program before being forced to reboot.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2.1.3 Why Partition?

   Several users think a single large partition will be fine, but there are
   several reasons why this is a bad idea. First, each partition has
   different operational characteristics and separating them allows the file
   system to tune accordingly. For example, the root and /usr partitions are
   read-mostly, without much writing. While a lot of reading and writing
   could occur in /var and /var/tmp.

   By properly partitioning a system, fragmentation introduced in the smaller
   write heavy partitions will not bleed over into the mostly-read
   partitions. Keeping the write-loaded partitions closer to the disk's edge,
   will increase I/O performance in the partitions where it occurs the most.
   Now while I/O performance in the larger partitions may be needed, shifting
   them more toward the edge of the disk will not lead to a significant
   performance improvement over moving /var to the edge. Finally, there are
   safety concerns. A smaller, neater root partition which is mostly
   read-only has a greater chance of surviving a bad crash.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.3 Core Configuration

   The principal location for system configuration information is within
   /etc/rc.conf. This file contains a wide range of configuration
   information, principally used at system startup to configure the system.
   Its name directly implies this; it is configuration information for the
   rc* files.

   An administrator should make entries in the rc.conf file to override the
   default settings from /etc/defaults/rc.conf. The defaults file should not
   be copied verbatim to /etc - it contains default values, not examples. All
   system-specific changes should be made in the rc.conf file itself.

   A number of strategies may be applied in clustered applications to
   separate site-wide configuration from system-specific configuration in
   order to keep administration overhead down. The recommended approach is to
   place site-wide configuration into another file, such as
   /etc/rc.conf.site, and then include this file into /etc/rc.conf, which
   will contain only system-specific information.

   As rc.conf is read by sh(1) it is trivial to achieve this. For example:

     * rc.conf:

         . rc.conf.site
         hostname="node15.example.com"
         network_interfaces="fxp0 lo0"
         ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1"

     * rc.conf.site:

         defaultrouter="10.1.1.254"
         saver="daemon"
         blanktime="100"

   The rc.conf.site file can then be distributed to every system using rsync
   or a similar program, while the rc.conf file remains unique.

   Upgrading the system using make world will not overwrite the rc.conf file,
   so system configuration information will not be lost.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.4 Application Configuration

   Typically, installed applications have their own configuration files, with
   their own syntax, etc. It is important that these files be kept separate
   from the base system, so that they may be easily located and managed by
   the package management tools.

   Typically, these files are installed in /usr/local/etc. In the case where
   an application has a large number of configuration files, a subdirectory
   will be created to hold them.

   Normally, when a port or package is installed, sample configuration files
   are also installed. These are usually identified with a .default suffix.
   If there are no existing configuration files for the application, they
   will be created by copying the .default files.

   For example, consider the contents of the directory /usr/local/etc/apache:

 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2184 May 20  1998 access.conf
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2184 May 20  1998 access.conf.default
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   9555 May 20  1998 httpd.conf
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   9555 May 20  1998 httpd.conf.default
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  12205 May 20  1998 magic
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  12205 May 20  1998 magic.default
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2700 May 20  1998 mime.types
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2700 May 20  1998 mime.types.default
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   7980 May 20  1998 srm.conf
 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   7933 May 20  1998 srm.conf.default

   The file sizes show that only the srm.conf file has been changed. A later
   update of the Apache port would not overwrite this changed file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.5 Starting Services

   It is common for a system to host a number of services. These may be
   started in several different fashions, each having different advantages.

   Software installed from a port or the packages collection will often place
   a script in /usr/local/etc/rc.d which is invoked at system startup with a
   start argument, and at system shutdown with a stop argument. This is the
   recommended way for starting system-wide services that are to be run as
   root, or that expect to be started as root. These scripts are registered
   as part of the installation of the package, and will be removed when the
   package is removed.

   A generic startup script in /usr/local/etc/rc.d looks like:

 #!/bin/sh
 echo -n ' FooBar'

 case "$1" in
 start)
         /usr/local/bin/foobar
         ;;
 stop)
         kill -9 `cat /var/run/foobar.pid`
         ;;
 *)
         echo "Usage: `basename $0` {start|stop}" >&2
         exit 64
         ;;
 esac

 exit 0
    

   The startup scripts of DragonFly will look in /usr/local/etc/rc.d for
   scripts that have an .sh extension and are executable by root. Those
   scripts that are found are called with an option start at startup, and
   stop at shutdown to allow them to carry out their purpose. So if you
   wanted the above sample script to be picked up and run at the proper time
   during system startup, you should save it to a file called FooBar.sh in
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d and make sure it is executable. You can make a shell
   script executable with chmod(1) as shown below:

 # chmod 755 FooBar.sh

   Some services expect to be invoked by inetd(8) when a connection is
   received on a suitable port. This is common for mail reader servers (POP
   and IMAP, etc.). These services are enabled by editing the file
   /etc/inetd.conf. See inetd(8) for details on editing this file.

   Some additional system services may not be covered by the toggles in
   /etc/rc.conf. These are traditionally enabled by placing the command(s) to
   invoke them in /etc/rc.local (which does not exist by default). Note that
   rc.local is generally regarded as the location of last resort; if there is
   a better place to start a service, do it there.

     Note: Do not place any commands in /etc/rc.conf. To start daemons, or
     run any commands at boot time, place a script in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
     instead.

   It is also possible to use the cron(8) daemon to start system services.
   This approach has a number of advantages, not least being that because
   cron(8) runs these processes as the owner of the crontab, services may be
   started and maintained by non-root users.

   This takes advantage of a feature of cron(8): the time specification may
   be replaced by @reboot, which will cause the job to be run when cron(8) is
   started shortly after system boot.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.6 Configuring the cron Utility

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   One of the most useful utilities in DragonFly is cron(8). The cron utility
   runs in the background and constantly checks the /etc/crontab file. The
   cron utility also checks the /var/cron/tabs directory, in search of new
   crontab files. These crontab files store information about specific
   functions which cron is supposed to perform at certain times.

   The cron utility uses two different types of configuration files, the
   system crontab and user crontabs. The only difference between these two
   formats is the sixth field. In the system crontab, the sixth field is the
   name of a user for the command to run as. This gives the system crontab
   the ability to run commands as any user. In a user crontab, the sixth
   field is the command to run, and all commands run as the user who created
   the crontab; this is an important security feature.

     Note: User crontabs allow individual users to schedule tasks without the
     need for root privileges. Commands in a user's crontab run with the
     permissions of the user who owns the crontab.

     The root user can have a user crontab just like any other user. This one
     is different from /etc/crontab (the system crontab). Because of the
     system crontab, there's usually no need to create a user crontab for
     root.

   Let us take a look at the /etc/crontab file (the system crontab):

 # /etc/crontab - root's crontab for DragonFly
 #
 # (1)
 #
 SHELL=/bin/sh
 PATH=/etc:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin (2)
 HOME=/var/log
 #
 #
 #minute hour    mday    month   wday    who     command (3)
 #
 #
 */5     *       *       *       *       root    /usr/libexec/atrun (4)

   (1)
           Like most DragonFly configuration files, the # character
           represents a comment. A comment can be placed in the file as a
           reminder of what and why a desired action is performed. Comments
           cannot be on the same line as a command or else they will be
           interpreted as part of the command; they must be on a new line.
           Blank lines are ignored.
   (2)
           First, the environment must be defined. The equals (=) character
           is used to define any environment settings, as with this example
           where it is used for the SHELL, PATH, and HOME options. If the
           shell line is omitted, cron will use the default, which is sh. If
           the PATH variable is omitted, no default will be used and file
           locations will need to be absolute. If HOME is omitted, cron will
           use the invoking users home directory.
   (3)
           This line defines a total of seven fields. Listed here are the
           values minute, hour, mday, month, wday, who, and command. These
           are almost all self explanatory. minute is the time in minutes the
           command will be run. hour is similar to the minute option, just in
           hours. mday stands for day of the month. month is similar to hour
           and minute, as it designates the month. The wday option stands for
           day of the week. All these fields must be numeric values, and
           follow the twenty-four hour clock. The who field is special, and
           only exists in the /etc/crontab file. This field specifies which
           user the command should be run as. When a user installs his or her
           crontab file, they will not have this option. Finally, the command
           option is listed. This is the last field, so naturally it should
           designate the command to be executed.
   (4)
           This last line will define the values discussed above. Notice here
           we have a */5 listing, followed by several more * characters.
           These * characters mean ``first-last'', and can be interpreted as
           every time. So, judging by this line, it is apparent that the
           atrun command is to be invoked by root every five minutes
           regardless of what day or month it is. For more information on the
           atrun command, see the atrun(8) manual page.

           Commands can have any number of flags passed to them; however,
           commands which extend to multiple lines need to be broken with the
           backslash ``\'' continuation character.

   This is the basic set up for every crontab file, although there is one
   thing different about this one. Field number six, where we specified the
   username, only exists in the system /etc/crontab file. This field should
   be omitted for individual user crontab files.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.6.1 Installing a Crontab

     Important: You must not use the procedure described here to edit/install
     the system crontab. Simply use your favorite editor: the cron utility
     will notice that the file has changed and immediately begin using the
     updated version. If you use crontab to load the /etc/crontab file you
     may get an error like ``root: not found'' because of the system
     crontab's additional user field.

   To install a freshly written user crontab, first use your favorite editor
   to create a file in the proper format, and then use the crontab utility.
   The most common usage is:

 % crontab crontab-file

   In this example, crontab-file is the filename of a crontab that was
   previously created.

   There is also an option to list installed crontab files: just pass the -l
   option to crontab and look over the output.

   For users who wish to begin their own crontab file from scratch, without
   the use of a template, the crontab -e option is available. This will
   invoke the selected editor with an empty file. When the file is saved, it
   will be automatically installed by the crontab command.

   If you later want to remove your user crontab completely, use crontab with
   the -r option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7 Using rc under DragonFly

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   DragonFly uses the NetBSD rc.d system for system initialization. Users
   should notice the files listed in the /etc/rc.d directory. Many of these
   files are for basic services which can be controlled with the start, stop,
   and restart options. For instance, sshd(8) can be restarted with the
   following command:

 # /etc/rc.d/sshd restart

   This procedure is similar for other services. Of course, services are
   usually started automatically as specified in rc.conf(5). For example,
   enabling the Network Address Translation daemon at startup is as simple as
   adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

 natd_enable="YES"

   If a natd_enable="NO" line is already present, then simply change the NO
   to YES. The rc scripts will automatically load any other dependent
   services during the next reboot, as described below.

   Since the rc.d system is primarily intended to start/stop services at
   system startup/shutdown time, the standard start, stop and restart options
   will only perform their action if the appropriate /etc/rc.conf variables
   are set. For instance the above sshd restart command will only work if
   sshd_enable is set to YES in /etc/rc.conf. To start, stop or restart a
   service regardless of the settings in /etc/rc.conf, the commands should be
   prefixed with ``force''. For instance to restart sshd regardless of the
   current /etc/rc.conf setting, execute the following command:

 # /etc/rc.d/sshd forcerestart

   It is easy to check if a service is enabled in /etc/rc.conf by running the
   appropriate rc.d script with the option rcvar. Thus, an administrator can
   check that sshd is in fact enabled in /etc/rc.conf by running:

 # /etc/rc.d/sshd rcvar
 # sshd
 $sshd_enable=YES

     Note: The second line (# sshd) is the output from the rc.d script, not a
     root prompt.

   To determine if a service is running, a status option is available. For
   instance to verify that sshd is actually started:

 # /etc/rc.d/sshd status
 sshd is running as pid 433.

   It is also possible to reload a service. This will attempt to send a
   signal to an individual service, forcing the service to reload its
   configuration files. In most cases this means sending the service a SIGHUP
   signal.

   The rcNG structure is used both for network services and system
   initialization. Some services are run only at boot; and the RCNG system is
   what triggers them.

   Many system services depend on other services to function properly. For
   example, NIS and other RPC-based services may fail to start until after
   the rpcbind (portmapper) service has started. To resolve this issue,
   information about dependencies and other meta-data is included in the
   comments at the top of each startup script. The rcorder(8) program is then
   used to parse these comments during system initialization to determine the
   order in which system services should be invoked to satisfy the
   dependencies. The following words may be included at the top of each
   startup file:

     * PROVIDE: Specifies the services this file provides.

     * REQUIRE: Lists services which are required for this service. This file
       will run after the specified services.

     * BEFORE: Lists services which depend on this service. This file will
       run before the specified services.

     * KEYWORD: When rcorder(8) uses the -k option, then only the rc.d files
       matching this keyword are used. [5] For example, when using -k
       shutdown, only the rc.d scripts defining the shutdown keyword are
       used.

       With the -s option, rcorder(8) will skip any rc.d script defining the
       corresponding keyword to skip. For example, scripts defining the
       nostart keyword are skipped at boot time.

   By using this method, an administrator can easily control system services
   without the hassle of ``runlevels'' like some other UNIX operating
   systems.

   Additional information about the DragonFly rc.d system can be found in the
   rc(8), rc.conf(5), and rc.subr(8) manual pages.

6.8 Setting Up Network Interface Cards

   Contributed by Marc Fonvieille.

   Nowadays we can not think about a computer without thinking about a
   network connection. Adding and configuring a network card is a common task
   for any DragonFly administrator.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.8.1 Locating the Correct Driver

   Before you begin, you should know the model of the card you have, the chip
   it uses, and whether it is a PCI or ISA card. DragonFly supports a wide
   variety of both PCI and ISA cards. Check the Hardware Compatibility List
   for your release to see if your card is supported.

   Once you are sure your card is supported, you need to determine the proper
   driver for the card. The file /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT will give you
   the list of network interfaces drivers with some information about the
   supported chipsets/cards. If you have doubts about which driver is the
   correct one, read the manual page of the driver. The manual page will give
   you more information about the supported hardware and even the possible
   problems that could occur.

   If you own a common card, most of the time you will not have to look very
   hard for a driver. Drivers for common network cards are present in the
   GENERIC kernel, so your card should show up during boot, like so:

 dc0: <82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX> port 0xa000-0xa0ff mem 0xd3800000-0xd38
 000ff irq 15 at device 11.0 on pci0
 dc0: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:da
 miibus0: <MII bus> on dc0
 ukphy0: <Generic IEEE 802.3u media interface> on miibus0
 ukphy0:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto
 dc1: <82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX> port 0x9800-0x98ff mem 0xd3000000-0xd30
 000ff irq 11 at device 12.0 on pci0
 dc1: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:db
 miibus1: <MII bus> on dc1
 ukphy1: <Generic IEEE 802.3u media interface> on miibus1
 ukphy1:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto

   In this example, we see that two cards using the dc(4) driver are present
   on the system.

   To use your network card, you will need to load the proper driver. This
   may be accomplished in one of two ways. The easiest way is to simply load
   a kernel module for your network card with kldload(8). A module is not
   available for all network card drivers (ISA cards and cards using the
   ed(4) driver, for example). Alternatively, you may statically compile the
   support for your card into your kernel. Check /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT
   and the manual page of the driver to know what to add in your kernel
   configuration file. For more information about recompiling your kernel,
   please see Chapter 9. If your card was detected at boot by your kernel
   (GENERIC) you do not have to build a new kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.8.2 Configuring the Network Card

   Once the right driver is loaded for the network card, the card needs to be
   configured. As with many other things, the network card may have been
   configured at installation time.

   To display the configuration for the network interfaces on your system,
   enter the following command:

 % ifconfig
 dc0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
         ether 00:a0:cc:da:da:da
         media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX <full-duplex>)
         status: active
 dc1: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
         ether 00:a0:cc:da:da:db
         media: Ethernet 10baseT/UTP
         status: no carrier
 lp0: flags=8810<POINTOPOINT,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
 lo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384
         inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
 tun0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1500

     Note: Note that entries concerning IPv6 (inet6 etc.) were omitted in
     this example.

   In this example, the following devices were displayed:

     * dc0: The first Ethernet interface

     * dc1: The second Ethernet interface

     * lp0: The parallel port interface

     * lo0: The loopback device

     * tun0: The tunnel device used by ppp

   DragonFly uses the driver name followed by the order in which one the card
   is detected at the kernel boot to name the network card, starting the
   count at zero. For example, sis2 would be the third network card on the
   system using the sis(4) driver.

   In this example, the dc0 device is up and running. The key indicators are:

    1. UP means that the card is configured and ready.

    2. The card has an Internet (inet) address (in this case 192.168.1.3).

    3. It has a valid subnet mask (netmask; 0xffffff00 is the same as
       255.255.255.0).

    4. It has a valid broadcast address (in this case, 192.168.1.255).

    5. The MAC address of the card (ether) is 00:a0:cc:da:da:da

    6. The physical media selection is on autoselection mode (media: Ethernet
       autoselect (100baseTX <full-duplex>)). We see that dc1 was configured
       to run with 10baseT/UTP media. For more information on available media
       types for a driver, please refer to its manual page.

    7. The status of the link (status) is active, i.e. the carrier is
       detected. For dc1, we see status: no carrier. This is normal when an
       Ethernet cable is not plugged into the card.

   If the ifconfig(8) output had shown something similar to:

 dc0: flags=8843<BROADCAST,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
                 ether 00:a0:cc:da:da:da

   it would indicate the card has not been configured.

   To configure your card, you need root privileges. The network card
   configuration can be done from the command line with ifconfig(8) as root.

 # ifconfig dc0 inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0

   Manually configuring the care has the disadvantage that you would have to
   do it after each reboot of the system. The file /etc/rc.conf is where to
   add the network card's configuration.

   Open /etc/rc.conf in your favorite editor. You need to add a line for each
   network card present on the system, for example in our case, we added
   these lines:

 ifconfig_dc0="inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
 ifconfig_dc1="inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 media 10baseT/UTP"

   You have to replace dc0, dc1, and so on, with the correct device for your
   cards, and the addresses with the proper ones. You should read the card
   driver and ifconfig(8) manual pages for more details about the allowed
   options and also rc.conf(5) manual page for more information on the syntax
   of /etc/rc.conf.

   If you configured the network during installation, some lines about the
   network card(s) may be already present. Double check /etc/rc.conf before
   adding any lines.

   You will also have to edit the file /etc/hosts to add the names and the IP
   addresses of various machines of the LAN, if they are not already there.
   For more information please refer to hosts(5) and to
   /usr/share/examples/etc/hosts.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.8.3 Testing and Troubleshooting

   Once you have made the necessary changes in /etc/rc.conf, you should
   reboot your system. This will allow the change(s) to the interface(s) to
   be applied, and verify that the system restarts without any configuration
   errors.

   Once the system has been rebooted, you should test the network interfaces.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.8.3.1 Testing the Ethernet Card

   To verify that an Ethernet card is configured correctly, you have to try
   two things. First, ping the interface itself, and then ping another
   machine on the LAN.

   First test the local interface:

 % ping -c5 192.168.1.3
 PING 192.168.1.3 (192.168.1.3): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.082 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.074 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.076 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.108 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.076 ms

 --- 192.168.1.3 ping statistics ---
 5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.074/0.083/0.108/0.013 ms

   Now we have to ping another machine on the LAN:

 % ping -c5 192.168.1.2
 PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.726 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.766 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.700 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.747 ms
 64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.704 ms

 --- 192.168.1.2 ping statistics ---
 5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.700/0.729/0.766/0.025 ms

   You could also use the machine name instead of 192.168.1.2 if you have set
   up the /etc/hosts file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.8.3.2 Troubleshooting

   Troubleshooting hardware and software configurations is always a pain, and
   a pain which can be alleviated by checking the simple things first. Is
   your network cable plugged in? Have you properly configured the network
   services? Did you configure the firewall correctly? Is the card you are
   using supported by DragonFly? Always check the hardware notes before
   sending off a bug report. Update your version of DragonFly to the latest
   PREVIEW version. Check the mailing list archives, or perhaps search the
   Internet.

   If the card works, yet performance is poor, it would be worthwhile to read
   over the tuning(7) manual page. You can also check the network
   configuration as incorrect network settings can cause slow connections.

   Some users experience one or two ``device timeouts'', which is normal for
   some cards. If they continue, or are bothersome, you may wish to be sure
   the device is not conflicting with another device. Double check the cable
   connections. Perhaps you may just need to get another card.

   At times, users see a few ``watchdog timeout'' errors. The first thing to
   do here is to check your network cable. Many cards require a PCI slot
   which supports Bus Mastering. On some old motherboards, only one PCI slot
   allows it (usually slot 0). Check the network card and the motherboard
   documentation to determine if that may be the problem.

   ``No route to host'' messages occur if the system is unable to route a
   packet to the destination host. This can happen if no default route is
   specified, or if a cable is unplugged. Check the output of netstat -rn and
   make sure there is a valid route to the host you are trying to reach. If
   there is not, read on to Chapter 19.

   ``ping: sendto: Permission denied'' error messages are often caused by a
   misconfigured firewall. If ipfw is enabled in the kernel but no rules have
   been defined, then the default policy is to deny all traffic, even ping
   requests! Read on to Section 10.7 for more information.

   Sometimes performance of the card is poor, or below average. In these
   cases it is best to set the media selection mode from autoselect to the
   correct media selection. While this usually works for most hardware, it
   may not resolve this issue for everyone. Again, check all the network
   settings, and read over the tuning(7) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.9 Virtual Hosts

   A very common use of DragonFly is virtual site hosting, where one server
   appears to the network as many servers. This is achieved by assigning
   multiple network addresses to a single interface.

   A given network interface has one ``real'' address, and may have any
   number of ``alias'' addresses. These aliases are normally added by placing
   alias entries in /etc/rc.conf.

   An alias entry for the interface fxp0 looks like:

 ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"

   Note that alias entries must start with alias0 and proceed upwards in
   order, (for example, _alias1, _alias2, and so on). The configuration
   process will stop at the first missing number.

   The calculation of alias netmasks is important, but fortunately quite
   simple. For a given interface, there must be one address which correctly
   represents the network's netmask. Any other addresses which fall within
   this network must have a netmask of all 1s (expressed as either
   255.255.255.255 or 0xffffffff).

   For example, consider the case where the fxp0 interface is connected to
   two networks, the 10.1.1.0 network with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and the
   202.0.75.16 network with a netmask of 255.255.255.240. We want the system
   to appear at 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.5 and at 202.0.75.17 through
   202.0.75.20. As noted above, only the first address in a given network
   range (in this case, 10.0.1.1 and 202.0.75.17) should have a real netmask;
   all the rest (10.1.1.2 through 10.1.1.5 and 202.0.75.18 through
   202.0.75.20) must be configured with a netmask of 255.255.255.255.

   The following entries configure the adapter correctly for this
   arrangement:

  ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias1="inet 10.1.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias2="inet 10.1.1.4 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias3="inet 10.1.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias4="inet 202.0.75.17 netmask 255.255.255.240"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias5="inet 202.0.75.18 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias6="inet 202.0.75.19 netmask 255.255.255.255"
  ifconfig_fxp0_alias7="inet 202.0.75.20 netmask 255.255.255.255"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.10 Configuration Files

  6.10.1 /etc Layout

   There are a number of directories in which configuration information is
   kept. These include:

   /etc                Generic system configuration information; data here is 
                       system-specific.                                       
   /etc/defaults       Default versions of system configuration files.        
   /etc/mail           Extra sendmail(8) configuration, other MTA             
                       configuration files.                                   
   /etc/ppp            Configuration for both user- and kernel-ppp programs.  
   /etc/namedb         Default location for named(8) data. Normally           
                       named.conf and zone files are stored here.             
   /usr/local/etc      Configuration files for installed applications. May    
                       contain per-application subdirectories.                
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d Start/stop scripts for installed applications.         
                       Automatically generated system-specific database       
   /var/db             files, such as the package database, the locate        
                       database, and so on                                    

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.10.2 Hostnames

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.10.2.1 /etc/resolv.conf

   /etc/resolv.conf dictates how DragonFly's resolver accesses the Internet
   Domain Name System (DNS).

   The most common entries to resolv.conf are:

              The IP address of a name server the resolver should query. The  
   nameserver servers are queried in the order listed with a maximum of       
              three.                                                          
   search     Search list for hostname lookup. This is normally determined by 
              the domain of the local hostname.                               
   domain     The local domain name.                                          

   A typical resolv.conf:

 search example.com
 nameserver 147.11.1.11
 nameserver 147.11.100.30

     Note: Only one of the search and domain options should be used.

   If you are using DHCP, dhclient(8) usually rewrites resolv.conf with
   information received from the DHCP server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.10.2.2 /etc/hosts

   /etc/hosts is a simple text database reminiscent of the old Internet. It
   works in conjunction with DNS and NIS providing name to IP address
   mappings. Local computers connected via a LAN can be placed in here for
   simplistic naming purposes instead of setting up a named(8) server.
   Additionally, /etc/hosts can be used to provide a local record of Internet
   names, reducing the need to query externally for commonly accessed names.

 #
 # Host Database
 # This file should contain the addresses and aliases
 # for local hosts that share this file.
 # In the presence of the domain name service or NIS, this file may
 # not be consulted at all; see /etc/nsswitch.conf for the resolution order.
 #
 #
 ::1                     localhost localhost.my.domain myname.my.domain
 127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.my.domain myname.my.domain

 #
 # Imaginary network.
 #10.0.0.2               myname.my.domain myname
 #10.0.0.3               myfriend.my.domain myfriend
 #
 # According to RFC 1918, you can use the following IP networks for
 # private nets which will never be connected to the Internet:
 #
 #       10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
 #       172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
 #       192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255
 #
 # In case you want to be able to connect to the Internet, you need
 # real official assigned numbers.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not try
 # to invent your own network numbers but instead get one from your
 # network provider (if any) or from the Internet Registry (ftp to
 # rs.internic.net, directory `/templates').
 #

   /etc/hosts takes on the simple format of:

 [Internet address] [official hostname] [alias1] [alias2] ...

   For example:

 10.0.0.1 myRealHostname.example.com myRealHostname foobar1 foobar2

   Consult hosts(5) for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.10.3 Log File Configuration

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.10.3.1 syslog.conf

   syslog.conf is the configuration file for the syslogd(8) program. It
   indicates which types of syslog messages are logged to particular log
   files.

 #
 #       Spaces ARE valid field separators in this file. However,
 #       other *nix-like systems still insist on using tabs as field
 #       separators. If you are sharing this file between systems, you
 #       may want to use only tabs as field separators here.
 #       Consult the syslog.conf(5) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.10.3.2 newsyslog.conf

   newsyslog.conf is the configuration file for newsyslog(8), a program that
   is normally scheduled to run by cron(8). newsyslog(8) determines when log
   files require archiving or rearranging. logfile is moved to logfile.0,
   logfile.0 is moved to logfile.1, and so on. Alternatively, the log files
   may be archived in gzip(1) format causing them to be named: logfile.0.gz,
   logfile.1.gz, and so on.

   newsyslog.conf indicates which log files are to be managed, how many are
   to be kept, and when they are to be touched. Log files can be rearranged
   and/or archived when they have either reached a certain size, or at a
   certain periodic time/date.

 # configuration file for newsyslog

  6.10.4 sysctl.conf

   sysctl.conf looks much like rc.conf. Values are set in a variable=value
   form. The specified values are set after the system goes into multi-user
   mode. Not all variables are settable in this mode.

   A sample sysctl.conf turning off logging of fatal signal exits and letting
   Linux programs know they are really running under DragonFly:

 kern.logsigexit=0       # Do not log fatal signal exits (e.g. sig 11)
 compat.linux.osname=DragonFly
 compat.linux.osrelease=4.3-STABLE

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.11 Tuning with sysctl

   sysctl(8) is an interface that allows you to make changes to a running
   DragonFly system. This includes many advanced options of the TCP/IP stack
   and virtual memory system that can dramatically improve performance for an
   experienced system administrator. Over five hundred system variables can
   be read and set using sysctl(8).

   At its core, sysctl(8) serves two functions: to read and to modify system
   settings.

   To view all readable variables:

 % sysctl -a

   To read a particular variable, for example, kern.maxproc:

 % sysctl kern.maxproc
 kern.maxproc: 1044

   To set a particular variable, use the intuitive variable=value syntax:

 # sysctl kern.maxfiles=5000
 kern.maxfiles: 2088 -> 5000

   Settings of sysctl variables are usually either strings, numbers, or
   booleans (a boolean being 1 for yes or a 0 for no).

   If you want to set automatically some variables each time the machine
   boots, add them to the /etc/sysctl.conf file. For more information see the
   sysctl.conf(5) manual page and the Section 6.10.4.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.11.1 sysctl(8) Read-only

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   In some cases it may be desirable to modify read-only sysctl(8) values.
   While this is not recommended, it is also sometimes unavoidable.

   For instance on some laptop models the cardbus(4) device will not probe
   memory ranges, and fail with errors which look similar to:

 cbb0: Could not map register memory
 device_probe_and_attach: cbb0 attach returned 12

   Cases like the one above usually require the modification of some default
   sysctl(8) settings which are set read only. To overcome these situations a
   user can put sysctl(8) ``OIDs'' in their local /boot/loader.conf. Default
   settings are located in the /boot/defaults/loader.conf file.

   Fixing the problem mentioned above would require a user to set
   hw.pci.allow_unsupported_io_range=1 in the aforementioned file. Now
   cardbus(4) will work properly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.12 Tuning Disks

  6.12.1 Sysctl Variables

    6.12.1.1 vfs.vmiodirenable

   The vfs.vmiodirenable sysctl variable may be set to either 0 (off) or 1
   (on); it is 1 by default. This variable controls how directories are
   cached by the system. Most directories are small, using just a single
   fragment (typically 1 K) in the file system and less (typically 512 bytes)
   in the buffer cache. With this variable turned off (to 0), the buffer
   cache will only cache a fixed number of directories even if ou have a huge
   amount of memory. When turned on (to 1), this sysctl allows the buffer
   cache to use the VM Page Cache to cache the directories, making all the
   memory available for caching directories. However, the minimum in-core
   memory used to cache a directory is the physical page size (typically 4 K)
   rather than 512  bytes. We recommend keeping this option on if you are
   running any services which manipulate large numbers of files. Such
   services can include web caches, large mail systems, and news systems.
   Keeping this option on will generally not reduce performance even with the
   wasted memory but you should experiment to find out.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.12.1.2 vfs.write_behind

   The vfs.write_behind sysctl variable defaults to 1 (on). This tells the
   file system to issue media writes as full clusters are collected, which
   typically occurs when writing large sequential files. The idea is to avoid
   saturating the buffer cache with dirty buffers when it would not benefit
   I/O performance. However, this may stall processes and under certain
   circumstances you may wish to turn it off.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.12.1.3 vfs.hirunningspace

   The vfs.hirunningspace sysctl variable determines how much outstanding
   write I/O may be queued to disk controllers system-wide at any given
   instance. The default is usually sufficient but on machines with lots of
   disks you may want to bump it up to four or five megabytes. Note that
   setting too high a value (exceeding the buffer cache's write threshold)
   can lead to extremely bad clustering performance. Do not set this value
   arbitrarily high! Higher write values may add latency to reads occurring
   at the same time.

   There are various other buffer-cache and VM page cache related sysctls. We
   do not recommend modifying these values. The VM system does an extremely
   good job of automatically tuning itself.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.12.1.4 vm.swap_idle_enabled

   The vm.swap_idle_enabled sysctl variable is useful in large multi-user
   systems where you have lots of users entering and leaving the system and
   lots of idle processes. Such systems tend to generate a great deal of
   continuous pressure on free memory reserves. Turning this feature on and
   tweaking the swapout hysteresis (in idle seconds) via
   vm.swap_idle_threshold1 and vm.swap_idle_threshold2 allows you to depress
   the priority of memory pages associated with idle processes more quickly
   then the normal pageout algorithm. This gives a helping hand to the
   pageout daemon. Do not turn this option on unless you need it, because the
   tradeoff you are making is essentially pre-page memory sooner rather than
   later; thus eating more swap and disk bandwidth. In a small system this
   option will have a determinable effect but in a large system that is
   already doing moderate paging this option allows the VM system to stage
   whole processes into and out of memory easily.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.12.1.5 hw.ata.wc

   IDE drives lie about when a write completes. With IDE write caching turned
   on, IDE hard drives not only write data to disk out of order, but will
   sometimes delay writing some blocks indefinitely when under heavy disk
   loads. A crash or power failure may cause serious file system corruption.
   Turning off write caching will remove the danger of this data loss, but
   will also cause disk operations to proceed very slowly. Change this only
   if prepared to suffer with the disk slowdown.

   Changing this variable must be done from the boot loader at boot time.
   Attempting to do it after the kernel boots will have no effect.

   For more information, please see ata(4) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.12.2 Soft Updates

   The tunefs(8) program can be used to fine-tune a file system. This program
   has many different options, but for now we are only concerned with
   toggling Soft Updates on and off, which is done by:

 # tunefs -n enable /filesystem
 # tunefs -n disable /filesystem

   A filesystem cannot be modified with tunefs(8) while it is mounted. A good
   time to enable Soft Updates is before any partitions have been mounted, in
   single-user mode.

     Note: It is possible to enable Soft Updates at filesystem creation time,
     through use of the -U option to newfs(8).

   Soft Updates drastically improves meta-data performance, mainly file
   creation and deletion, through the use of a memory cache. We recommend to
   use Soft Updates on all of your file systems. There are two downsides to
   Soft Updates that you should be aware of: First, Soft Updates guarantees
   filesystem consistency in the case of a crash but could very easily be
   several seconds (even a minute!) behind updating the physical disk. If
   your system crashes you may lose more work than otherwise. Secondly, Soft
   Updates delays the freeing of filesystem blocks. If you have a filesystem
   (such as the root filesystem) which is almost full, performing a major
   update, such as make installworld, can cause the filesystem to run out of
   space and the update to fail.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.12.2.1 More Details about Soft Updates

   There are two traditional approaches to writing a file systems meta-data
   back to disk. (Meta-data updates are updates to non-content data like
   inodes or directories.)

   Historically, the default behavior was to write out meta-data updates
   synchronously. If a directory had been changed, the system waited until
   the change was actually written to disk. The file data buffers (file
   contents) were passed through the buffer cache and backed up to disk later
   on asynchronously. The advantage of this implementation is that it
   operates safely. If there is a failure during an update, the meta-data are
   always in a consistent state. A file is either created completely or not
   at all. If the data blocks of a file did not find their way out of the
   buffer cache onto the disk by the time of the crash, fsck(8) is able to
   recognize this and repair the filesystem by setting the file length to 0.
   Additionally, the implementation is clear and simple. The disadvantage is
   that meta-data changes are slow. An rm -r, for instance, touches all the
   files in a directory sequentially, but each directory change (deletion of
   a file) will be written synchronously to the disk. This includes updates
   to the directory itself, to the inode table, and possibly to indirect
   blocks allocated by the file. Similar considerations apply for unrolling
   large hierarchies (tar -x).

   The second case is asynchronous meta-data updates. This is the default for
   Linux/ext2fs and mount -o async for *BSD ufs. All meta-data updates are
   simply being passed through the buffer cache too, that is, they will be
   intermixed with the updates of the file content data. The advantage of
   this implementation is there is no need to wait until each meta-data
   update has been written to disk, so all operations which cause huge
   amounts of meta-data updates work much faster than in the synchronous
   case. Also, the implementation is still clear and simple, so there is a
   low risk for bugs creeping into the code. The disadvantage is that there
   is no guarantee at all for a consistent state of the filesystem. If there
   is a failure during an operation that updated large amounts of meta-data
   (like a power failure, or someone pressing the reset button), the
   filesystem will be left in an unpredictable state. There is no opportunity
   to examine the state of the filesystem when the system comes up again; the
   data blocks of a file could already have been written to the disk while
   the updates of the inode table or the associated directory were not. It is
   actually impossible to implement a fsck which is able to clean up the
   resulting chaos (because the necessary information is not available on the
   disk). If the filesystem has been damaged beyond repair, the only choice
   is to use newfs(8) on it and restore it from backup.

   The usual solution for this problem was to implement dirty region logging,
   which is also referred to as journaling, although that term is not used
   consistently and is occasionally applied to other forms of transaction
   logging as well. Meta-data updates are still written synchronously, but
   only into a small region of the disk. Later on they will be moved to their
   proper location. Because the logging area is a small, contiguous region on
   the disk, there are no long distances for the disk heads to move, even
   during heavy operations, so these operations are quicker than synchronous
   updates. Additionally the complexity of the implementation is fairly
   limited, so the risk of bugs being present is low. A disadvantage is that
   all meta-data are written twice (once into the logging region and once to
   the proper location) so for normal work, a performance ``pessimization''
   might result. On the other hand, in case of a crash, all pending meta-data
   operations can be quickly either rolled-back or completed from the logging
   area after the system comes up again, resulting in a fast filesystem
   startup.

   Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley FFS, solved this problem with
   Soft Updates: all pending meta-data updates are kept in memory and written
   out to disk in a sorted sequence (``ordered meta-data updates''). This has
   the effect that, in case of heavy meta-data operations, later updates to
   an item ``catch'' the earlier ones if the earlier ones are still in memory
   and have not already been written to disk. So all operations on, say, a
   directory are generally performed in memory before the update is written
   to disk (the data blocks are sorted according to their position so that
   they will not be on the disk ahead of their meta-data). If the system
   crashes, this causes an implicit ``log rewind'': all operations which did
   not find their way to the disk appear as if they had never happened. A
   consistent filesystem state is maintained that appears to be the one of 30
   to 60 seconds earlier. The algorithm used guarantees that all resources in
   use are marked as such in their appropriate bitmaps: blocks and inodes.
   After a crash, the only resource allocation error that occurs is that
   resources are marked as ``used'' which are actually ``free''. fsck(8)
   recognizes this situation, and frees the resources that are no longer
   used. It is safe to ignore the dirty state of the filesystem after a crash
   by forcibly mounting it with mount -f. In order to free resources that may
   be unused, fsck(8) needs to be run at a later time.

   The advantage is that meta-data operations are nearly as fast as
   asynchronous updates (i.e. faster than with logging, which has to write
   the meta-data twice). The disadvantages are the complexity of the code
   (implying a higher risk for bugs in an area that is highly sensitive
   regarding loss of user data), and a higher memory consumption.
   Additionally there are some idiosyncrasies one has to get used to. After a
   crash, the state of the filesystem appears to be somewhat ``older''. In
   situations where the standard synchronous approach would have caused some
   zero-length files to remain after the fsck, these files do not exist at
   all with a Soft Updates filesystem because neither the meta-data nor the
   file contents have ever been written to disk. Disk space is not released
   until the updates have been written to disk, which may take place some
   time after running rm. This may cause problems when installing large
   amounts of data on a filesystem that does not have enough free space to
   hold all the files twice.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.13 Tuning Kernel Limits

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.13.1 File/Process Limits

    6.13.1.1 kern.maxfiles

   kern.maxfiles can be raised or lowered based upon your system
   requirements. This variable indicates the maximum number of file
   descriptors on your system. When the file descriptor table is full,
   ``file: table is full'' will show up repeatedly in the system message
   buffer, which can be viewed with the dmesg command.

   Each open file, socket, or fifo uses one file descriptor. A large-scale
   production server may easily require many thousands of file descriptors,
   depending on the kind and number of services running concurrently.

   kern.maxfile's default value is dictated by the MAXUSERS option in your
   kernel configuration file. kern.maxfiles grows proportionally to the value
   of MAXUSERS. When compiling a custom kernel, it is a good idea to set this
   kernel configuration option according to the uses of your system. From
   this number, the kernel is given most of its pre-defined limits. Even
   though a production machine may not actually have 256 users connected at
   once, the resources needed may be similar to a high-scale web server.

     Note: Setting MAXUSERS to 0 in your kernel configuration file will
     choose a reasonable default value based on the amount of RAM present in
     your system. It is set to 0 in the default GENERIC kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.13.1.2 kern.ipc.somaxconn

   The kern.ipc.somaxconn sysctl variable limits the size of the listen queue
   for accepting new TCP connections. The default value of 128 is typically
   too low for robust handling of new connections in a heavily loaded web
   server environment. For such environments, it is recommended to increase
   this value to 1024 or higher. The service daemon may itself limit the
   listen queue size (e.g. sendmail(8), or Apache) but will often have a
   directive in its configuration file to adjust the queue size. Large listen
   queues also do a better job of avoiding Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.13.2 Network Limits

   The NMBCLUSTERS kernel configuration option dictates the amount of network
   Mbufs available to the system. A heavily-trafficked server with a low
   number of Mbufs will hinder DragonFly's ability. Each cluster represents
   approximately 2 K of memory, so a value of 1024 represents 2 megabytes of
   kernel memory reserved for network buffers. A simple calculation can be
   done to figure out how many are needed. If you have a web server which
   maxes out at 1000 simultaneous connections, and each connection eats a
   16 K receive and 16 K send buffer, you need approximately 32 MB worth of
   network buffers to cover the web server. A good rule of thumb is to
   multiply by 2, so 2x32 MB / 2 KB = 64 MB / 2 kB = 32768. We recommend
   values between 4096 and 32768 for machines with greater amounts of memory.
   Under no circumstances should you specify an arbitrarily high value for
   this parameter as it could lead to a boot time crash. The -m option to
   netstat(1) may be used to observe network cluster use.
   kern.ipc.nmbclusters loader tunable should be used to tune this at boot
   time.

   For busy servers that make extensive use of the sendfile(2) system call,
   it may be necessary to increase the number of sendfile(2) buffers via the
   NSFBUFS kernel configuration option or by setting its value in
   /boot/loader.conf (see loader(8) for details). A common indicator that
   this parameter needs to be adjusted is when processes are seen in the
   sfbufa state. The sysctl variable kern.ipc.nsfbufs is a read-only glimpse
   at the kernel configured variable. This parameter nominally scales with
   kern.maxusers, however it may be necessary to tune accordingly.

     Important: Even though a socket has been marked as non-blocking, calling
     sendfile(2) on the non-blocking socket may result in the sendfile(2)
     call blocking until enough struct sf_buf's are made available.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.13.2.1 net.inet.ip.portrange.*

   The net.inet.ip.portrange.* sysctl variables control the port number
   ranges automatically bound to TCP and UDP sockets. There are three ranges:
   a low range, a default range, and a high range. Most network programs use
   the default range which is controlled by the net.inet.ip.portrange.first
   and net.inet.ip.portrange.last, which default to 1024 and 5000,
   respectively. Bound port ranges are used for outgoing connections, and it
   is possible to run the system out of ports under certain circumstances.
   This most commonly occurs when you are running a heavily loaded web proxy.
   The port range is not an issue when running servers which handle mainly
   incoming connections, such as a normal web server, or has a limited number
   of outgoing connections, such as a mail relay. For situations where you
   may run yourself out of ports, it is recommended to increase
   net.inet.ip.portrange.last modestly. A value of 10000, 20000 or 30000 may
   be reasonable. You should also consider firewall effects when changing the
   port range. Some firewalls may block large ranges of ports (usually
   low-numbered ports) and expect systems to use higher ranges of ports for
   outgoing connections -- for this reason it is recommended that
   net.inet.ip.portrange.first be lowered.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.13.2.2 TCP Bandwidth Delay Product

   The TCP Bandwidth Delay Product Limiting is similar to TCP/Vegas in
   NetBSD. It can be enabled by setting net.inet.tcp.inflight_enable sysctl
   variable to 1. The system will attempt to calculate the bandwidth delay
   product for each connection and limit the amount of data queued to the
   network to just the amount required to maintain optimum throughput.

   This feature is useful if you are serving data over modems, Gigabit
   Ethernet, or even high speed WAN links (or any other link with a high
   bandwidth delay product), especially if you are also using window scaling
   or have configured a large send window. If you enable this option, you
   should also be sure to set net.inet.tcp.inflight_debug to 0 (disable
   debugging), and for production use setting net.inet.tcp.inflight_min to at
   least 6144 may be beneficial. However, note that setting high minimums may
   effectively disable bandwidth limiting depending on the link. The limiting
   feature reduces the amount of data built up in intermediate route and
   switch packet queues as well as reduces the amount of data built up in the
   local host's interface queue. With fewer packets queued up, interactive
   connections, especially over slow modems, will also be able to operate
   with lower Round Trip Times. However, note that this feature only effects
   data transmission (uploading / server side). It has no effect on data
   reception (downloading).

   Adjusting net.inet.tcp.inflight_stab is not recommended. This parameter
   defaults to 20, representing 2 maximal packets added to the bandwidth
   delay product window calculation. The additional window is required to
   stabilize the algorithm and improve responsiveness to changing conditions,
   but it can also result in higher ping times over slow links (though still
   much lower than you would get without the inflight algorithm). In such
   cases, you may wish to try reducing this parameter to 15, 10, or 5; and
   may also have to reduce net.inet.tcp.inflight_min (for example, to 3500)
   to get the desired effect. Reducing these parameters should be done as a
   last resort only.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.14 Adding Swap Space

   No matter how well you plan, sometimes a system does not run as you
   expect. If you find you need more swap space, it is simple enough to add.
   You have three ways to increase swap space: adding a new hard drive,
   enabling swap over NFS, and creating a swap file on an existing partition.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.14.1 Swap on a New Hard Drive

   The best way to add swap, of course, is to use this as an excuse to add
   another hard drive. You can always use another hard drive, after all. If
   you can do this, go reread the discussion about swap space in Section 6.2
   for some suggestions on how to best arrange your swap.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.14.2 Swapping over NFS

   Swapping over NFS is only recommended if you do not have a local hard disk
   to swap to. Even though DragonFly has an excellent NFS implementation, NFS
   swapping will be limited by the available network bandwidth and puts an
   additional burden on the NFS server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.14.3 Swapfiles

   You can create a file of a specified size to use as a swap file. In our
   example here we will use a 64MB file called /usr/swap0. You can use any
   name you want, of course.

   Example 6-1. Creating a Swapfile

    1. Be certain that your kernel configuration includes the vnode driver.
       It is not in recent versions of GENERIC.

 pseudo-device   vn 1   #Vnode driver (turns a file into a device)

    2. Create a vn-device:

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV vn0

    3. Create a swapfile (/usr/swap0):

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/swap0 bs=1024k count=64

    4. Set proper permissions on (/usr/swap0):

 # chmod 0600 /usr/swap0

    5. Enable the swap file in /etc/rc.conf:

 swapfile="/usr/swap0"   # Set to name of swapfile if aux swapfile desired.

    6. Reboot the machine or to enable the swap file immediately, type:

 # vnconfig -e /dev/vn0b /usr/swap0 swap

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.15 Power and Resource Management

   Written by Hiten Pandya and Tom Rhodes.

   It is very important to utilize hardware resources in an efficient manner.
   Before ACPI was introduced, it was very difficult and inflexible for
   operating systems to manage the power usage and thermal properties of a
   system. The hardware was controlled by some sort of BIOS embedded
   interface, such as Plug and Play BIOS (PNPBIOS), or Advanced Power
   Management (APM) and so on. Power and Resource Management is one of the
   key components of a modern operating system. For example, you may want an
   operating system to monitor system limits (and possibly alert you) in case
   your system temperature increased unexpectedly.

   In this section, we will provide comprehensive information about ACPI.
   References will be provided for further reading at the end. Please be
   aware that ACPI is available on DragonFly systems as a default kernel
   module.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.15.1 What Is ACPI?

   Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is a standard written by
   an alliance of vendors to provide a standard interface for hardware
   resources and power management (hence the name). It is a key element in
   Operating System-directed configuration and Power Management, i.e.: it
   provides more control and flexibility to the operating system (OS). Modern
   systems ``stretched'' the limits of the current Plug and Play interfaces
   (such as APM), prior to the introduction of ACPI. ACPI is the direct
   successor to APM (Advanced Power Management).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.15.2 Shortcomings of Advanced Power Management (APM)

   The Advanced Power Management (APM) facility control's the power usage of
   a system based on its activity. The APM BIOS is supplied by the (system)
   vendor and it is specific to the hardware platform. An APM driver in the
   OS mediates access to the APM Software Interface, which allows management
   of power levels.

   There are four major problems in APM. Firstly, power management is done by
   the (vendor-specific) BIOS, and the OS does not have any knowledge of it.
   One example of this, is when the user sets idle-time values for a hard
   drive in the APM BIOS, that when exceeded, it (BIOS) would spin down the
   hard drive, without the consent of the OS. Secondly, the APM logic is
   embedded in the BIOS, and it operates outside the scope of the OS. This
   means users can only fix problems in their APM BIOS by flashing a new one
   into the ROM; which, is a very dangerous procedure, and if it fails, it
   could leave the system in an unrecoverable state. Thirdly, APM is a
   vendor-specific technology, which, means that there is a lot or parity
   (duplication of efforts) and bugs found in one vendor's BIOS, may not be
   solved in others. Last but not the least, the APM BIOS did not have enough
   room to implement a sophisticated power policy, or one that can adapt very
   well to the purpose of the machine.

   Plug and Play BIOS (PNPBIOS) was unreliable in many situations. PNPBIOS is
   16-bit technology, so the OS has to use 16-bit emulation in order to
   ``interface'' with PNPBIOS methods.

   The DragonFly APM driver is documented in the apm(4) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.15.3 Configuring ACPI

   The acpi.ko driver is loaded by default at start up by the loader(8) and
   should not be compiled into the kernel. The reasoning behind this is that
   modules are easier to work with, say if switching to another acpi.ko
   without doing a kernel rebuild. This has the advantage of making testing
   easier. Another reason is that starting ACPI after a system has been
   brought up is not too useful, and in some cases can be fatal. In doubt,
   just disable ACPI all together. This driver should not and can not be
   unloaded because the system bus uses it for various hardware interactions.
   ACPI can be disabled with the acpiconf(8) utility. In fact most of the
   interaction with ACPI can be done via acpiconf(8). Basically this means,
   if anything about ACPI is in the dmesg(8) output, then most likely it is
   already running.

     Note: ACPI and APM cannot coexist and should be used separately. The
     last one to load will terminate if the driver notices the other running.

   In the simplest form, ACPI can be used to put the system into a sleep mode
   with acpiconf(8), the -s flag, and a 1-5 option. Most users will only need
   1. Option 5 will do a soft-off which is the same action as:

 # halt -p

   The other options are available. Check out the acpiconf(8) manual page for
   more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.16 Using and Debugging DragonFly ACPI

   Written by Nate Lawson. With contributions from Peter Schultz and Tom
   Rhodes.

   ACPI is a fundamentally new way of discovering devices, managing power
   usage, and providing standardized access to various hardware previously
   managed by the BIOS. Progress is being made toward ACPI working on all
   systems, but bugs in some motherboards' ACPI Machine Language (AML)
   bytecode, incompleteness in DragonFly's kernel subsystems, and bugs in the
   Intel ACPI-CA interpreter continue to appear.

   This document is intended to help you assist the DragonFly ACPI
   maintainers in identifying the root cause of problems you observe and
   debugging and developing a solution. Thanks for reading this and we hope
   we can solve your system's problems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.1 Submitting Debugging Information

     Note: Before submitting a problem, be sure you are running the latest
     BIOS version and, if available, embedded controller firmware version.

   For those of you that want to submit a problem right away, please send the
   following information to bugs

     * Description of the buggy behavior, including system type and model and
       anything that causes the bug to appear. Also, please note as
       accurately as possible when the bug began occurring if it is new for
       you.

     * The dmesg output after ``boot -v'', including any error messages
       generated by you exercising the bug.

     * dmesg output from ``boot -v'' with ACPI disabled, if disabling it
       helps fix the problem.

     * Output from ``sysctl hw.acpi''. This is also a good way of figuring
       out what features your system offers.

     * URL where your ACPI Source Language (ASL) can be found. Do not send
       the ASL directly to the list as it can be very large. Generate a copy
       of your ASL by running this command:

 # acpidump -t -d > name-system.asl

       (Substitute your login name for name and manufacturer/model for
       system. Example: njl-FooCo6000.asl)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.2 Background

   ACPI is present in all modern computers that conform to the ia32 (x86),
   ia64 (Itanium), and amd64 (AMD) architectures. The full standard has many
   features including CPU performance management, power planes control,
   thermal zones, various battery systems, embedded controllers, and bus
   enumeration. Most systems implement less than the full standard. For
   instance, a desktop system usually only implements the bus enumeration
   parts while a laptop might have cooling and battery management support as
   well. Laptops also have suspend and resume, with their own associated
   complexity.

   An ACPI-compliant system has various components. The BIOS and chipset
   vendors provide various fixed tables (e.g., FADT) in memory that specify
   things like the APIC map (used for SMP), config registers, and simple
   configuration values. Additionally, a table of bytecode (the
   Differentiated System Description Table DSDT) is provided that specifies a
   tree-like name space of devices and methods.

   The ACPI driver must parse the fixed tables, implement an interpreter for
   the bytecode, and modify device drivers and the kernel to accept
   information from the ACPI subsystem. For DragonFly, Intel has provided an
   interpreter (ACPI-CA) that is shared with Linux and NetBSD. The path to
   the ACPI-CA source code is src/sys/contrib/dev/acpica-unix-YYYYMMDD, where
   YYYYMMDD is the release date of the ACPI-CA source code. The glue code
   that allows ACPI-CA to work on DragonFly is in src/sys/dev/acpica5/Osd.
   Finally, drivers that implement various ACPI devices are found in
   src/sys/dev/acpica5, and architecture-dependent code resides in
   /sys/arch/acpica5.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.3 Common Problems

   For ACPI to work correctly, all the parts have to work correctly. Here are
   some common problems, in order of frequency of appearance, and some
   possible workarounds or fixes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.3.1 Suspend/Resume

   ACPI has three suspend to RAM (STR) states, S1-S3, and one suspend to disk
   state (STD), called S4. S5 is ``soft off'' and is the normal state your
   system is in when plugged in but not powered up. S4 can actually be
   implemented two separate ways. S4BIOS is a BIOS-assisted suspend to disk.
   S4OS is implemented entirely by the operating system.

   Start by checking sysctl hw.acpi for the suspend-related items. Here are
   the results for my Thinkpad:

 hw.acpi.supported_sleep_state: S3 S4 S5

 hw.acpi.s4bios: 0

   This means that I can use acpiconf -s to test S3, S4OS, and S5. If s4bios
   was one (1), I would have S4BIOS support instead of S4 OS.

   When testing suspend/resume, start with S1, if supported. This state is
   most likely to work since it doesn't require much driver support. No one
   has implemented S2 but if you have it, it's similar to S1. The next thing
   to try is S3. This is the deepest STR state and requires a lot of driver
   support to properly reinitialize your hardware. If you have problems
   resuming, feel free to email the bugs list but do not expect the problem
   to be resolved since there are a lot of drivers/hardware that need more
   testing and work.

   To help isolate the problem, remove as many drivers from your kernel as
   possible. If it works, you can narrow down which driver is the problem by
   loading drivers until it fails again. Typically binary drivers like
   nvidia.ko, X11 display drivers, and USB will have the most problems while
   Ethernet interfaces usually work fine. If you can load/unload the drivers
   ok, you can automate this by putting the appropriate commands in
   /etc/rc.suspend and /etc/rc.resume. There is a commented-out example for
   unloading and loading a driver. Try setting hw.acpi.reset_video to zero
   (0) if your display is messed up after resume. Try setting longer or
   shorter values for hw.acpi.sleep_delay to see if that helps.

   Another thing to try is load a recent Linux distribution with ACPI support
   and test their suspend/resume support on the same hardware. If it works on
   Linux, it's likely a DragonFly driver problem and narrowing down which
   driver causes the problems will help us fix the problem. Note that the
   ACPI maintainers do not usually maintain other drivers (e.g sound, ATA,
   etc.) so any work done on tracking down a driver problem should probably
   eventually be posted to the bugs list and mailed to the driver maintainer.
   If you are feeling adventurous, go ahead and start putting some debugging
   printf(3)s in a problematic driver to track down where in its resume
   function it hangs.

   Finally, try disabling ACPI and enabling APM instead. If suspend/resume
   works with APM, you may be better off sticking with APM, especially on
   older hardware (pre-2000). It took vendors a while to get ACPI support
   correct and older hardware is more likely to have BIOS problems with ACPI.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.3.2 System Hangs (temporary or permanent)

   Most system hangs are a result of lost interrupts or an interrupt storm.
   Chipsets have a lot of problems based on how the BIOS configures
   interrupts before boot, correctness of the APIC (MADT) table, and routing
   of the System Control Interrupt (SCI).

   Interrupt storms can be distinguished from lost interrupts by checking the
   output of vmstat -i and looking at the line that has acpi0. If the counter
   is increasing at more than a couple per second, you have an interrupt
   storm. If the system appears hung, try breaking to DDB (CTRL+ALT+ESC on
   console) and type show interrupts.

   Your best hope when dealing with interrupt problems is to try disabling
   APIC support with hint.apic.0.disabled="1" in loader.conf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.3.3 Panics

   Panics are relatively rare for ACPI and are the top priority to be fixed.
   The first step is to isolate the steps to reproduce the panic (if
   possible) and get a backtrace. Follow the advice for enabling options DDB
   and setting up a serial console (see Section 17.6.5.3) or setting up a
   dump(8) partition. You can get a backtrace in DDB with tr. If you have to
   handwrite the backtrace, be sure to at least get the lowest five (5) and
   top five (5) lines in the trace.

   Then, try to isolate the problem by booting with ACPI disabled. If that
   works, you can isolate the ACPI subsystem by using various values of
   debug.acpi.disable. See the acpi(4) manual page for some examples.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.3.4 System Powers Up After Suspend or Shutdown

   First, try setting hw.acpi.disable_on_poweroff=``0'' in loader.conf(5).
   This keeps ACPI from disabling various events during the shutdown process.
   Some systems need this value set to ``1'' (the default) for the same
   reason. This usually fixes the problem of a system powering up
   spontaneously after a suspend or poweroff.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.3.5 Other Problems

   If you have other problems with ACPI (working with a docking station,
   devices not detected, etc.), please email a description to the mailing
   list as well; however, some of these issues may be related to unfinished
   parts of the ACPI subsystem so they might take a while to be implemented.
   Please be patient and prepared to test patches we may send you.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.4 ASL, acpidump, and IASL

   The most common problem is the BIOS vendors providing incorrect (or
   outright buggy!) bytecode. This is usually manifested by kernel console
   messages like this:

 ACPI-1287: *** Error: Method execution failed [\\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.FIGD._STA] \\
 (Node 0xc3f6d160), AE_NOT_FOUND

   Often, you can resolve these problems by updating your BIOS to the latest
   revision. Most console messages are harmless but if you have other
   problems like battery status not working, they're a good place to start
   looking for problems in the AML. The bytecode, known as AML, is compiled
   from a source language called ASL. The AML is found in the table known as
   the DSDT. To get a copy of your ASL, use acpidump(8). You should use both
   the -t (show contents of the fixed tables) and -d (disassemble AML to ASL)
   options. See the Submitting Debugging Information section for an example
   syntax.

   The simplest first check you can do is to recompile your ASL to check for
   errors. Warnings can usually be ignored but errors are bugs that will
   usually prevent ACPI from working correctly. To recompile your ASL, issue
   the following command:

 # iasl your.asl

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.5 Fixing Your ASL

   In the long run, our goal is for almost everyone to have ACPI work without
   any user intervention. At this point, however, we are still developing
   workarounds for common mistakes made by the BIOS vendors. The Microsoft
   interpreter (acpi.sys and acpiec.sys) does not strictly check for
   adherence to the standard, and thus many BIOS vendors who only test ACPI
   under Windows never fix their ASL. We hope to continue to identify and
   document exactly what non-standard behavior is allowed by Microsoft's
   interpreter and replicate it so DragonFly can work without forcing users
   to fix the ASL. As a workaround and to help us identify behavior, you can
   fix the ASL manually. If this works for you, please send a diff(1) of the
   old and new ASL so we can possibly work around the buggy behavior in
   ACPI-CA and thus make your fix unnecessary.

   Here is a list of common error messages, their cause, and how to fix them:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.5.1 _OS dependencies

   Some AML assumes the world consists of various Windows versions. You can
   tell DragonFly to claim it is any OS to see if this fixes problems you may
   have. An easy way to override this is to set hw.acpi.osname=``Windows
   2001'' in /boot/loader.conf or other similar strings you find in the ASL.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.5.2 Missing Return statements

   Some methods do not explicitly return a value as the standard requires.
   While ACPI-CA does not handle this, DragonFly has a workaround that allows
   it to return the value implicitly. You can also add explicit Return
   statements where required if you know what value should be returned. To
   force iasl to compile the ASL, use the -f flag.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.16.5.3 Overriding the Default AML

   After you customize your.asl, you will want to compile it, run:

 # iasl your.asl

   You can add the -f flag to force creation of the AML, even if there are
   errors during compilation. Remember that some errors (e.g., missing Return
   statements) are automatically worked around by the interpreter.

   DSDT.aml is the default output filename for iasl. You can load this
   instead of your BIOS's buggy copy (which is still present in flash memory)
   by editing /boot/loader.conf as follows:

 acpi_dsdt_load="YES"
 acpi_dsdt_name="/boot/DSDT.aml"

   Be sure to copy your DSDT.aml to the /boot directory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.16.6 Getting Debugging Output From ACPI

   The ACPI driver has a very flexible debugging facility. It allows you to
   specify a set of subsystems as well as the level of verbosity. The
   subsystems you wish to debug are specified as ``layers'' and are broken
   down into ACPI-CA components (ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS) and ACPI hardware
   support (ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS). The verbosity of debugging output is specified
   as the ``level'' and ranges from ACPI_LV_ERROR (just report errors) to
   ACPI_LV_VERBOSE (everything). The ``level'' is a bitmask so multiple
   options can be set at once, separated by spaces. In practice, you will
   want to use a serial console to log the output if it is so long it flushes
   the console message buffer.

   Debugging output is not enabled by default. To enable it, add options
   ACPI_DEBUG to your kernel config if ACPI is compiled into the kernel. You
   can add ACPI_DEBUG=1 to your /etc/make.conf to enable it globally. If it
   is a module, you can recompile just your acpi.ko module as follows:

 # cd /sys/dev/acpica5
 && make clean &&
 make ACPI_DEBUG=1

   Install acpi.ko in /boot/kernel and add your desired level and layer to
   loader.conf. This example enables debug messages for all ACPI-CA
   components and all ACPI hardware drivers (CPU, LID, etc.) It will only
   output error messages, the least verbose level.

 debug.acpi.layer="ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS"
 debug.acpi.level="ACPI_LV_ERROR"

   If the information you want is triggered by a specific event (say, a
   suspend and then resume), you can leave out changes to loader.conf and
   instead use sysctl to specify the layer and level after booting and
   preparing your system for the specific event. The sysctls are named the
   same as the tunables in loader.conf.

                    Chapter 7 The DragonFly Booting Process

7.1 Synopsis

   The process of starting a computer and loading the operating system is
   referred to as ``the bootstrap process'', or simply ``booting''.
   DragonFly's boot process provides a great deal of flexibility in
   customizing what happens when you start the system, allowing you to select
   from different operating systems installed on the same computer, or even
   different versions of the same operating system or installed kernel.

   This chapter details the configuration options you can set and how to
   customize the DragonFly boot process. This includes everything that
   happens until the DragonFly kernel has started, probed for devices, and
   started init(8). If you are not quite sure when this happens, it occurs
   when the text color changes from bright white to grey.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * What the components of the DragonFly bootstrap system are, and how
       they interact.

     * The options you can give to the components in the DragonFly bootstrap
       to control the boot process.

     * The basics of device.hints(5).

     x86 Only: This chapter only describes the boot process for DragonFly
     running on x86 systems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.2 The Booting Problem

   Turning on a computer and starting the operating system poses an
   interesting dilemma. By definition, the computer does not know how to do
   anything until the operating system is started. This includes running
   programs from the disk. So if the computer can not run a program from the
   disk without the operating system, and the operating system programs are
   on the disk, how is the operating system started?

   This problem parallels one in the book The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.
   A character had fallen part way down a manhole, and pulled himself out by
   grabbing his bootstraps, and lifting. In the early days of computing the
   term bootstrap was applied to the mechanism used to load the operating
   system, which has become shortened to ``booting''.

   On x86 hardware the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is responsible for
   loading the operating system. To do this, the BIOS looks on the hard disk
   for the Master Boot Record (MBR), which must be located on a specific
   place on the disk. The BIOS has enough knowledge to load and run the MBR,
   and assumes that the MBR can then carry out the rest of the tasks involved
   in loading the operating system possibly with the help of the BIOS.

   The code within the MBR is usually referred to as a boot manager,
   especially when it interacts with the user. In this case the boot manager
   usually has more code in the first track of the disk or within some OS's
   file system. (A boot manager is sometimes also called a boot loader, but
   FreeBSD uses that term for a later stage of booting.) Popular boot
   managers include boot0 (a.k.a. Boot Easy, the standard DragonFly boot
   manager), Grub, GAG, and LILO. (Only boot0 fits within the MBR.)

   If you have only one operating system installed on your disks then a
   standard PC MBR will suffice. This MBR searches for the first bootable
   (a.k.a. active) slice on the disk, and then runs the code on that slice to
   load the remainder of the operating system. The MBR installed by fdisk(8),
   by default, is such an MBR. It is based on /boot/mbr.

   If you have installed multiple operating systems on your disks then you
   can install a different boot manager, one that can display a list of
   different operating systems, and allows you to choose the one to boot
   from. Two of these are discussed in the next subsection.

   The remainder of the DragonFly bootstrap system is divided into three
   stages. The first stage is run by the MBR, which knows just enough to get
   the computer into a specific state and run the second stage. The second
   stage can do a little bit more, before running the third stage. The third
   stage finishes the task of loading the operating system. The work is split
   into these three stages because the PC standards put limits on the size of
   the programs that can be run at stages one and two. Chaining the tasks
   together allows DragonFly to provide a more flexible loader.

   The kernel is then started and it begins to probe for devices and
   initialize them for use. Once the kernel boot process is finished, the
   kernel passes control to the user process init(8), which then makes sure
   the disks are in a usable state. init(8) then starts the user-level
   resource configuration which mounts file systems, sets up network cards to
   communicate on the network, and generally starts all the processes that
   usually are run on a DragonFly system at startup.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.3 The Boot Manager and Boot Stages

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.3.1 The Boot Manager

   The code in the MBR or boot manager is sometimes referred to as stage zero
   of the boot process. This subsection discusses two of the boot managers
   previously mentioned: boot0 and LILO.

   The boot0 Boot Manager: The MBR installed by FreeBSD's installer or
   boot0cfg(8), by default, is based on /boot/boot0. (The boot0 program is
   very simple, since the program in the MBR can only be 446 bytes long
   because of the slice table and 0x55AA identifier at the end of the MBR.)
   If you have installed boot0 and multiple operating systems on your hard
   disks, then you will see a display similar to this one at boot time:

   Example 7-1. boot0 Screenshot

 F1 DOS
 F2 FreeBSD
 F3 Linux
 F4 ??
 F5 Drive 1

 Default: F2

   Other operating systems, in particular Windows, have been known to
   overwrite an existing MBR with their own. If this happens to you, or you
   want to replace your existing MBR with the DragonFly MBR then use the
   following command:

 # fdisk -B -b /boot/boot0 device

   where device is the device that you boot from, such as ad0 for the first
   IDE disk, ad2 for the first IDE disk on a second IDE controller, da0 for
   the first SCSI disk, and so on. Or, if you want a custom configuration of
   the MBR, use boot0cfg(8).

   The LILO Boot Manager: To install this boot manager so it will also boot
   DragonFly, first start Linux and add the following to your existing
   /etc/lilo.conf configuration file:

 other=/dev/hdXY
 table=/dev/hdX
 loader=/boot/chain.b
 label=DragonFly

   In the above, specify DragonFly's primary partition and drive using Linux
   specifiers, replacing X with the Linux drive letter and Y with the Linux
   primary partition number. If you are using a SCSI drive, you will need to
   change /dev/hd to read something similar to /dev/sd. The
   loader=/boot/chain.b line can be omitted if you have both operating
   systems on the same drive. Now run /sbin/lilo -v to commit your new
   changes to the system; this should be verified by checking its screen
   messages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.3.2 Stage One, /boot/boot1, and Stage Two, /boot/boot2

   Conceptually the first and second stages are part of the same program, on
   the same area of the disk. Because of space constraints they have been
   split into two, but you would always install them together. They are
   copied from the combined file /boot/boot by the installer or disklabel
   (see below).

   They are located outside file systems, in the first track of the boot
   slice, starting with the first sector. This is where boot0, or any other
   boot manager, expects to find a program to run which will continue the
   boot process. The number of sectors used is easily determined from the
   size of /boot/boot.

   They are found on the boot sector of the boot slice, which is where boot0,
   or any other program on the MBR expects to find the program to run to
   continue the boot process. The files in the /boot directory are copies of
   the real files, which are stored outside of the DragonFly file system.

   boot1 is very simple, since it can only be 512 bytes in size, and knows
   just enough about the DragonFly disklabel, which stores information about
   the slice, to find and execute boot2.

   boot2 is slightly more sophisticated, and understands the DragonFly file
   system enough to find files on it, and can provide a simple interface to
   choose the kernel or loader to run.

   Since the loader is much more sophisticated, and provides a nice
   easy-to-use boot configuration, boot2 usually runs it, but previously it
   was tasked to run the kernel directly.

   Example 7-2. boot2 Screenshot

 >> DragonFly/i386 BOOT
 Default: 0:ad(0,a)/boot/loader
 boot:

   If you ever need to replace the installed boot1 and boot2 use
   disklabel(8):

 # disklabel -B diskslice

   where diskslice is the disk and slice you boot from, such as ad0s1 for the
   first slice on the first IDE disk.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.3.3 Stage Three, /boot/loader

   The loader is the final stage of the three-stage bootstrap, and is located
   on the file system, usually as /boot/loader.

   The loader is intended as a user-friendly method for configuration, using
   an easy-to-use built-in command set, backed up by a more powerful
   interpreter, with a more complex command set.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    7.3.3.1 Loader Program Flow

   During initialization, the loader will probe for a console and for disks,
   and figure out what disk it is booting from. It will set variables
   accordingly, and an interpreter is started where user commands can be
   passed from a script or interactively.

   The loader will then read /boot/loader.rc, which by default reads in
   /boot/defaults/loader.conf which sets reasonable defaults for variables
   and reads /boot/loader.conf for local changes to those variables.
   loader.rc then acts on these variables, loading whichever modules and
   kernel are selected.

   Finally, by default, the loader issues a 10 second wait for key presses,
   and boots the kernel if it is not interrupted. If interrupted, the user is
   presented with a prompt which understands the easy-to-use command set,
   where the user may adjust variables, unload all modules, load modules, and
   then finally boot or reboot.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    7.3.3.2 Loader Built-In Commands

   These are the most commonly used loader commands. For a complete
   discussion of all available commands, please see loader(8).

   autoboot seconds

           Proceeds to boot the kernel if not interrupted within the time
           span given, in seconds. It displays a countdown, and the default
           time span is 10 seconds.

   boot [-options] [kernelname]

           Immediately proceeds to boot the kernel, with the given options,
           if any, and with the kernel name given, if it is.

   boot-conf

           Goes through the same automatic configuration of modules based on
           variables as what happens at boot. This only makes sense if you
           use unload first, and change some variables, most commonly kernel.

   help [topic]

           Shows help messages read from /boot/loader.help. If the topic
           given is index, then the list of available topics is given.

   include filename ...

           Processes the file with the given filename. The file is read in,
           and interpreted line by line. An error immediately stops the
           include command.

   load [-t type] filename

           Loads the kernel, kernel module, or file of the type given, with
           the filename given. Any arguments after filename are passed to the
           file.

   ls [-l] [path]

           Displays a listing of files in the given path, or the root
           directory, if the path is not specified. If -l is specified, file
           sizes will be shown too.

   lsdev [-v]

           Lists all of the devices from which it may be possible to load
           modules. If -v is specified, more details are printed.

   lsmod [-v]

           Displays loaded modules. If -v is specified, more details are
           shown.

   more filename

           Displays the files specified, with a pause at each LINES
           displayed.

   reboot

           Immediately reboots the system.

   set variable, set variable=value

           Sets the loader's environment variables.

   unload

           Removes all loaded modules.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    7.3.3.3 Loader Examples

   Here are some practical examples of loader usage:

     * To simply boot your usual kernel, but in single-user mode:

 boot -s

     * To unload your usual kernel and modules, and then load just your old
       (or another) kernel:

 unload
 load kernel.old

       You can use kernel.GENERIC to refer to the generic kernel that comes
       on the install disk, or kernel.old to refer to your previously
       installed kernel (when you have upgraded or configured your own
       kernel, for example).

         Note: Use the following to load your usual modules with another
         kernel:

 unload
 set kernel="kernel.old"
 boot-conf

     * To load a kernel configuration script (an automated script which does
       the things you would normally do in the kernel boot-time
       configurator):

 load -t userconfig_script /boot/kernel.conf

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.4 Kernel Interaction During Boot

   Once the kernel is loaded by either loader (as usual) or boot2 (bypassing
   the loader), it examines its boot flags, if any, and adjusts its behavior
   as necessary.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.4.1 Kernel Boot Flags

   Here are the more common boot flags:

   -a

           during kernel initialization, ask for the device to mount as the
           root file system.

   -C

           boot from CDROM.

   -c

           run UserConfig, the boot-time kernel configurator

   -s

           boot into single-user mode

   -v

           be more verbose during kernel startup

     Note: There are other boot flags; read boot(8) for more information on
     them.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.5 Init: Process Control Initialization

   Once the kernel has finished booting, it passes control to the user
   process init(8), which is located at /sbin/init, or the program path
   specified in the init_path variable in loader.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.5.1 Automatic Reboot Sequence

   The automatic reboot sequence makes sure that the file systems available
   on the system are consistent. If they are not, and fsck(8) cannot fix the
   inconsistencies, init(8) drops the system into single-user mode for the
   system administrator to take care of the problems directly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.5.2 Single-User Mode

   This mode can be reached through the automatic reboot sequence, or by the
   user booting with the -s option or setting the boot_single variable in
   loader.

   It can also be reached by calling shutdown(8) without the reboot (-r) or
   halt (-h) options, from multi-user mode.

   If the system console is set to insecure in /etc/ttys, then the system
   prompts for the root password before initiating single-user mode.

   Example 7-3. An Insecure Console in /etc/ttys

 # name  getty                           type    status          comments
 #
 # If console is marked "insecure", then init will ask for the root password
 # when going to single-user mode.
 console none                            unknown off insecure

     Note: An insecure console means that you consider your physical security
     to the console to be insecure, and want to make sure only someone who
     knows the root password may use single-user mode, and it does not mean
     that you want to run your console insecurely. Thus, if you want
     security, choose insecure, not secure.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  7.5.3 Multi-User Mode

   If init(8) finds your file systems to be in order, or once the user has
   finished in single-user mode, the system enters multi-user mode, in which
   it starts the resource configuration of the system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    7.5.3.1 Resource Configuration (rc)

   The resource configuration system reads in configuration defaults from
   /etc/defaults/rc.conf, and system-specific details from /etc/rc.conf, and
   then proceeds to mount the system file systems mentioned in /etc/fstab,
   start up networking services, start up miscellaneous system daemons, and
   finally runs the startup scripts of locally installed packages.

   The rc(8) manual page is a good reference to the resource configuration
   system, as is examining the scripts themselves.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.6 Shutdown Sequence

   Upon controlled shutdown, via shutdown(8), init(8) will attempt to run the
   script /etc/rc.shutdown, and then proceed to send all processes the TERM
   signal, and subsequently the KILL signal to any that do not terminate
   timely.

   To power down a DragonFly machine on architectures and systems that
   support power management, simply use the command shutdown -p now to turn
   the power off immediately. To just reboot a DragonFly system, just use
   shutdown -r now. You need to be root or a member of operator group to run
   shutdown(8). The halt(8) and reboot(8) commands can also be used, please
   refer to their manual pages and to shutdown(8)'s one for more information.

     Note: Power management requires acpi(4) support in the kernel or loaded
     as a module, or apm(4) support.

   Contributed by Neil Blakey-Milner.

8.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly allows multiple users to use the computer at the same time.
   Obviously, only one of those users can be sitting in front of the screen
   and keyboard at any one time [6], but any number of users can log in
   through the network to get their work done. To use the system every user
   must have an account.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * The differences between the various user accounts on a DragonFly
       system.

     * How to add user accounts.

     * How to remove user accounts.

     * How to change account details, such as the user's full name, or
       preferred shell.

     * How to set limits on a per-account basis, to control the resources
       such as memory and CPU time that accounts and groups of accounts are
       allowed to access.

     * How to use groups to make account management easier.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Understand the basics of UNIX and DragonFly (Chapter 3).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.2 Introduction

   All access to the system is achieved via accounts, and all processes are
   run by users, so user and account management are of integral importance on
   DragonFly systems.

   Every account on a DragonFly system has certain information associated
   with it to identify the account.

   User name

           The user name as it would be typed at the login: prompt. User
           names must be unique across the computer; you may not have two
           users with the same user name. There are a number of rules for
           creating valid user names, documented in passwd(5); you would
           typically use user names that consist of eight or fewer all lower
           case characters.

   Password

           Each account has a password associated with it. The password may
           be blank, in which case no password will be required to access the
           system. This is normally a very bad idea; every account should
           have a password.

   User ID (UID)

           The UID is a number, traditionally from 0 to 65535[7], used to
           uniquely identify the user to the system. Internally, DragonFly
           uses the UID to identify users--any DragonFly commands that allow
           you to specify a user name will convert it to the UID before
           working with it. This means that you can have several accounts
           with different user names but the same UID. As far as DragonFly is
           concerned, these accounts are one user. It is unlikely you will
           ever need to do this.

   Group ID (GID)

           The GID is a number, traditionally from 0 to 65535[7], used to
           uniquely identify the primary group that the user belongs to.
           Groups are a mechanism for controlling access to resources based
           on a user's GID rather than their UID. This can significantly
           reduce the size of some configuration files. A user may also be in
           more than one group.

   Login class

           Login classes are an extension to the group mechanism that provide
           additional flexibility when tailoring the system to different
           users.

   Password change time

           By default DragonFly does not force users to change their
           passwords periodically. You can enforce this on a per-user basis,
           forcing some or all of your users to change their passwords after
           a certain amount of time has elapsed.

   Account expiry time

           By default DragonFly does not expire accounts. If you are creating
           accounts that you know have a limited lifespan, for example, in a
           school where you have accounts for the students, then you can
           specify when the account expires. After the expiry time has
           elapsed the account cannot be used to log in to the system,
           although the account's directories and files will remain.

   User's full name

           The user name uniquely identifies the account to DragonFly, but
           does not necessarily reflect the user's real name. This
           information can be associated with the account.

   Home directory

           The home directory is the full path to a directory on the system
           in which the user will start when logging on to the system. A
           common convention is to put all user home directories under
           /home/username or /usr/home/username. The user would store their
           personal files in their home directory, and any directories they
           may create in there.

   User shell

           The shell provides the default environment users use to interact
           with the system. There are many different kinds of shells, and
           experienced users will have their own preferences, which can be
           reflected in their account settings.

   There are three main types of accounts: the Superuser, system users, and
   user accounts. The Superuser account, usually called root, is used to
   manage the system with no limitations on privileges. System users run
   services. Finally, user accounts are used by real people, who log on, read
   mail, and so forth.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3 The Superuser Account

   The superuser account, usually called root, comes preconfigured to
   facilitate system administration, and should not be used for day-to-day
   tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of the system,
   or programming.

   This is because the superuser, unlike normal user accounts, can operate
   without limits, and misuse of the superuser account may result in
   spectacular disasters. User accounts are unable to destroy the system by
   mistake, so it is generally best to use normal user accounts whenever
   possible, unless you especially need the extra privilege.

   You should always double and triple-check commands you issue as the
   superuser, since an extra space or missing character can mean irreparable
   data loss.

   So, the first thing you should do after reading this chapter is to create
   an unprivileged user account for yourself for general usage if you have
   not already. This applies equally whether you are running a multi-user or
   single-user machine. Later in this chapter, we discuss how to create
   additional accounts, and how to change between the normal user and
   superuser.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.4 System Accounts

   System users are those used to run services such as DNS, mail, web
   servers, and so forth. The reason for this is security; if all services
   ran as the superuser, they could act without restriction.

   Examples of system users are daemon, operator, bind (for the Domain Name
   Service), and news. Often sysadmins create httpd to run web servers they
   install.

   nobody is the generic unprivileged system user. However, it is important
   to keep in mind that the more services that use nobody, the more files and
   processes that user will become associated with, and hence the more
   privileged that user becomes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5 User Accounts

   User accounts are the primary means of access for real people to the
   system, and these accounts insulate the user and the environment,
   preventing the users from damaging the system or other users, and allowing
   users to customize their environment without affecting others.

   Every person accessing your system should have a unique user account. This
   allows you to find out who is doing what, prevent people from clobbering
   each others' settings or reading each others' mail, and so forth.

   Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate their use of the
   system, by using alternate shells, editors, key bindings, and language.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.6 Modifying Accounts

   There are a variety of different commands available in the UNIX
   environment to manipulate user accounts. The most common commands are
   summarized below, followed by more detailed examples of their usage.

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Command   |                          Summary                          |
   |------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | adduser(8) | The recommended command-line application for adding new   |
   |            | users.                                                    |
   |------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | rmuser(8)  | The recommended command-line application for removing     |
   |            | users.                                                    |
   |------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | chpass(1)  | A flexible tool to change user database information.      |
   |------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | passwd(1)  | The simple command-line tool to change user passwords.    |
   |------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | pw(8)      | A powerful and flexible tool to modify all aspects of     |
   |            | user accounts.                                            |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  8.6.1 adduser

   adduser(8) is a simple program for adding new users. It creates entries in
   the system passwd and group files. It will also create a home directory
   for the new user, copy in the default configuration files (``dotfiles'')
   from /usr/share/skel, and can optionally mail the new user a welcome
   message.

   To create the initial configuration file, use adduser -s -config_create.
   [8] Next, we configure adduser(8) defaults, and create our first user
   account, since using root for normal usage is evil and nasty.

   Example 8-1. Configuring adduser and adding a user

 # adduser -v
 Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.
 Check /etc/shells
 Check /etc/master.passwd
 Check /etc/group
 Enter your default shell: csh date no sh tcsh zsh [sh]: zsh
 Your default shell is: zsh -> /usr/local/bin/zsh
 Enter your default HOME partition: [/home]:
 Copy dotfiles from: /usr/share/skel no [/usr/share/skel]:
 Send message from file: /etc/adduser.message no
 [/etc/adduser.message]: no
 Do not send message
 Use passwords (y/n) [y]: y

 Write your changes to /etc/adduser.conf? (y/n) [n]: y

 Ok, let's go.
 Don't worry about mistakes. I will give you the chance later to correct any input.
 Enter username [a-z0-9_-]: jru
 Enter full name []: J. Random User
 Enter shell csh date no sh tcsh zsh [zsh]:
 Enter home directory (full path) [/home/jru]:
 Uid [1001]:
 Enter login class: default []:
 Login group jru [jru]:
 Login group is ``jru''. Invite jru into other groups: guest no
 [no]: wheel
 Enter password []:
 Enter password again []:

 Name:     jru
 Password: ****
 Fullname: J. Random User
 Uid:      1001
 Gid:      1001 (jru)
 Class:   
 Groups:   jru wheel
 HOME:     /home/jru
 Shell:    /usr/local/bin/zsh
 OK? (y/n) [y]: y
 Added user ``jru''
 Copy files from /usr/share/skel to /home/jru
 Add another user? (y/n) [y]: n
 Goodbye!
 #

   In summary, we changed the default shell to zsh (an additional shell found
   in pkgsrc), and turned off the sending of a welcome mail to added users.
   We then saved the configuration, created an account for jru, and made sure
   jru is in wheel group (so that she may assume the role of root with the
   su(1) command.)

     Note: The password you type in is not echoed, nor are asterisks
     displayed. Make sure you do not mistype the password twice.

     Note: Just use adduser(8) without arguments from now on, and you will
     not have to go through changing the defaults. If the program asks you to
     change the defaults, exit the program, and try the -s option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  8.6.2 rmuser

   You can use rmuser(8) to completely remove a user from the system.
   rmuser(8) performs the following steps:

    1. Removes the user's crontab(1) entry (if any).

    2. Removes any at(1) jobs belonging to the user.

    3. Kills all processes owned by the user.

    4. Removes the user from the system's local password file.

    5. Removes the user's home directory (if it is owned by the user).

    6. Removes the incoming mail files belonging to the user from /var/mail.

    7. Removes all files owned by the user from temporary file storage areas
       such as /tmp.

    8. Finally, removes the username from all groups to which it belongs in
       /etc/group.

         Note: If a group becomes empty and the group name is the same as the
         username, the group is removed; this complements the per-user unique
         groups created by adduser(8).

   rmuser(8) cannot be used to remove superuser accounts, since that is
   almost always an indication of massive destruction.

   By default, an interactive mode is used, which attempts to make sure you
   know what you are doing.

   Example 8-2. rmuser Interactive Account Removal

 # rmuser jru
 Matching password entry:
 jru:*:1001:1001::0:0:J. Random User:/home/jru:/usr/local/bin/zsh
 Is this the entry you wish to remove? y
 Remove user's home directory (/home/jru)? y
 Updating password file, updating databases, done.
 Updating group file: trusted (removing group jru -- personal group is empty) done.
 Removing user's incoming mail file /var/mail/jru: done.
 Removing files belonging to jru from /tmp: done.
 Removing files belonging to jru from /var/tmp: done.
 Removing files belonging to jru from /var/tmp/vi.recover: done.
 #

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  8.6.3 chpass

   chpass(1) changes user database information such as passwords, shells, and
   personal information.

   Only system administrators, as the superuser, may change other users'
   information and passwords with chpass(1).

   When passed no options, aside from an optional username, chpass(1)
   displays an editor containing user information. When the user exists from
   the editor, the user database is updated with the new information.

   Example 8-3. Interactive chpass by Superuser

 #Changing user database information for jru.
 Login: jru
 Password: *
 Uid [#]: 1001
 Gid [# or name]: 1001
 Change [month day year]:
 Expire [month day year]:
 Class:
 Home directory: /home/jru
 Shell: /usr/local/bin/zsh
 Full Name: J. Random User
 Office Location:
 Office Phone:
 Home Phone:
 Other information:

   The normal user can change only a small subset of this information, and
   only for themselves.

   Example 8-4. Interactive chpass by Normal User

 #Changing user database information for jru.
 Shell: /usr/local/bin/zsh
 Full Name: J. Random User
 Office Location:
 Office Phone:
 Home Phone:
 Other information:

     Note: chfn(1) and chsh(1) are just links to chpass(1), as are
     ypchpass(1), ypchfn(1), and ypchsh(1). NIS support is automatic, so
     specifying the yp before the command is not necessary. If this is
     confusing to you, do not worry, NIS will be covered in Chapter 19.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  8.6.4 passwd

   passwd(1) is the usual way to change your own password as a user, or
   another user's password as the superuser.

     Note: To prevent accidental or unauthorized changes, the original
     password must be entered before a new password can be set.

   Example 8-5. Changing Your Password

 % passwd
 Changing local password for jru.
 Old password:
 New password:
 Retype new password:
 passwd: updating the database...
 passwd: done

   Example 8-6. Changing Another User's Password as the Superuser

 # passwd jru
 Changing local password for jru.
 New password:
 Retype new password:
 passwd: updating the database...
 passwd: done

     Note: As with chpass(1), yppasswd(1) is just a link to passwd(1), so NIS
     works with either command.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  8.6.5 pw

   pw(8) is a command line utility to create, remove, modify, and display
   users and groups. It functions as a front end to the system user and group
   files. pw(8) has a very powerful set of command line options that make it
   suitable for use in shell scripts, but new users may find it more
   complicated than the other commands presented here.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.7 Limiting Users

   If you have users, the ability to limit their system use may have come to
   mind. DragonFly provides several ways an administrator can limit the
   amount of system resources an individual may use. These limits are divided
   into two sections: disk quotas, and other resource limits.

   Disk quotas limit disk usage to users, and they provide a way to quickly
   check that usage without calculating it every time. Quotas are discussed
   in Section 12.12.

   The other resource limits include ways to limit the amount of CPU, memory,
   and other resources a user may consume. These are defined using login
   classes and are discussed here.

   Login classes are defined in /etc/login.conf. The precise semantics are
   beyond the scope of this section, but are described in detail in the
   login.conf(5) manual page. It is sufficient to say that each user is
   assigned to a login class (default by default), and that each login class
   has a set of login capabilities associated with it. A login capability is
   a name=value pair, where name is a well-known identifier and value is an
   arbitrary string processed accordingly depending on the name. Setting up
   login classes and capabilities is rather straight-forward and is also
   described in login.conf(5).

   Resource limits are different from plain vanilla login capabilities in two
   ways. First, for every limit, there is a soft (current) and hard limit. A
   soft limit may be adjusted by the user or application, but may be no
   higher than the hard limit. The latter may be lowered by the user, but
   never raised. Second, most resource limits apply per process to a specific
   user, not the user as a whole. Note, however, that these differences are
   mandated by the specific handling of the limits, not by the implementation
   of the login capability framework (i.e., they are not really a special
   case of login capabilities).

   And so, without further ado, below are the most commonly used resource
   limits (the rest, along with all the other login capabilities, may be
   found in login.conf(5)).

   coredumpsize

           The limit on the size of a core file generated by a program is,
           for obvious reasons, subordinate to other limits on disk usage
           (e.g., filesize, or disk quotas). Nevertheless, it is often used
           as a less-severe method of controlling disk space consumption:
           since users do not generate core files themselves, and often do
           not delete them, setting this may save them from running out of
           disk space should a large program (e.g., emacs) crash.

   cputime

           This is the maximum amount of CPU time a user's process may
           consume. Offending processes will be killed by the kernel.

             Note: This is a limit on CPU time consumed, not percentage of
             the CPU as displayed in some fields by top(1) and ps(1). A limit
             on the latter is, at the time of this writing, not possible, and
             would be rather useless: legitimate use of a compiler, for
             instance, can easily use almost 100% of a CPU for some time.

   filesize

           This is the maximum size of a file the user may possess. Unlike
           disk quotas, this limit is enforced on individual files, not the
           set of all files a user owns.

   maxproc

           This is the maximum number of processes a user may be running.
           This includes foreground and background processes alike. For
           obvious reasons, this may not be larger than the system limit
           specified by the kern.maxproc sysctl(8). Also note that setting
           this too small may hinder a user's productivity: it is often
           useful to be logged in multiple times or execute pipelines. Some
           tasks, such as compiling a large program, also spawn multiple
           processes (e.g., make(1), cc(1), and other intermediate
           preprocessors).

   memorylocked

           This is the maximum amount a memory a process may have requested
           to be locked into main memory (e.g., see mlock(2)). Some
           system-critical programs, such as amd(8), lock into main memory
           such that in the event of being swapped out, they do not
           contribute to a system's trashing in time of trouble.

   memoryuse

           This is the maximum amount of memory a process may consume at any
           given time. It includes both core memory and swap usage. This is
           not a catch-all limit for restricting memory consumption, but it
           is a good start.

   openfiles

           This is the maximum amount of files a process may have open. In
           DragonFly, files are also used to represent sockets and IPC
           channels; thus, be careful not to set this too low. The
           system-wide limit for this is defined by the kern.maxfiles
           sysctl(8).

   sbsize

           This is the limit on the amount of network memory, and thus mbufs,
           a user may consume. This originated as a response to an old DoS
           attack by creating a lot of sockets, but can be generally used to
           limit network communications.

   stacksize

           This is the maximum size a process' stack may grow to. This alone
           is not sufficient to limit the amount of memory a program may use;
           consequently, it should be used in conjunction with other limits.

   There are a few other things to remember when setting resource limits.
   Following are some general tips, suggestions, and miscellaneous comments.

     * Processes started at system startup by /etc/rc are assigned to the
       daemon login class.

     * Although the /etc/login.conf that comes with the system is a good
       source of reasonable values for most limits, only you, the
       administrator, can know what is appropriate for your system. Setting a
       limit too high may open your system up to abuse, while setting it too
       low may put a strain on productivity.

     * Users of the X Window System (X11) should probably be granted more
       resources than other users. X11 by itself takes a lot of resources,
       but it also encourages users to run more programs simultaneously.

     * Remember that many limits apply to individual processes, not the user
       as a whole. For example, setting openfiles to 50 means that each
       process the user runs may open up to 50 files. Thus, the gross amount
       of files a user may open is the value of openfiles multiplied by the
       value of maxproc. This also applies to memory consumption.

   For further information on resource limits and login classes and
   capabilities in general, please consult the relevant manual pages:
   cap_mkdb(1), getrlimit(2), login.conf(5).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.8 Personalizing Users

   Localization is an environment set up by the system administrator or user
   to accommodate different languages, character sets, date and time
   standards, and so on. This is discussed in the localization chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.9 Groups

   A group is simply a list of users. Groups are identified by their group
   name and GID (Group ID). In DragonFly (and most other UNIX like systems),
   the two factors the kernel uses to decide whether a process is allowed to
   do something is its user ID and list of groups it belongs to. Unlike a
   user ID, a process has a list of groups associated with it. You may hear
   some things refer to the ``group ID'' of a user or process; most of the
   time, this just means the first group in the list.

   The group name to group ID map is in /etc/group. This is a plain text file
   with four colon-delimited fields. The first field is the group name, the
   second is the encrypted password, the third the group ID, and the fourth
   the comma-delimited list of members. It can safely be edited by hand
   (assuming, of course, that you do not make any syntax errors!). For a more
   complete description of the syntax, see the group(5) manual page.

   If you do not want to edit /etc/group manually, you can use the pw(8)
   command to add and edit groups. For example, to add a group called teamtwo
   and then confirm that it exists you can use:

   Example 8-7. Adding a Group Using pw(8)

 # pw groupadd teamtwo
 # pw groupshow teamtwo
 teamtwo:*:1100:

   The number 1100 above is the group ID of the group teamtwo. Right now,
   teamtwo has no members, and is thus rather useless. Let's change that by
   inviting jru to the teamtwo group.

   Example 8-8. Adding Somebody to a Group Using pw(8)

 # pw groupmod teamtwo -M jru
 # pw groupshow teamtwo
 teamtwo:*:1100:jru

   The argument to the -M option is a comma-delimited list of users who are
   members of the group. From the preceding sections, we know that the
   password file also contains a group for each user. The latter (the user)
   is automatically added to the group list by the system; the user will not
   show up as a member when using the groupshow command to pw(8), but will
   show up when the information is queried via id(1) or similar tool. In
   other words, pw(8) only manipulates the /etc/group file; it will never
   attempt to read additionally data from /etc/passwd.

   Example 8-9. Using id(1) to Determine Group Membership

 % id jru
 uid=1001(jru) gid=1001(jru) groups=1001(jru), 1100(teamtwo)

   As you can see, jru is a member of the groups jru and teamtwo.

   For more information about pw(8), see its manual page, and for more
   information on the format of /etc/group, consult the group(5) manual page.

                   Chapter 9 Configuring the DragonFly Kernel

   Updated and restructured by Jim Mock. Originally contributed by Jake
   Hamby.

9.1 Synopsis

   The kernel is the core of the DragonFly operating system. It is
   responsible for managing memory, enforcing security controls, networking,
   disk access, and much more. While more and more of DragonFly becomes
   dynamically configurable it is still occasionally necessary to reconfigure
   and recompile your kernel.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * Why you might need to build a custom kernel.

     * How to write a kernel configuration file, or alter an existing
       configuration file.

     * How to use the kernel configuration file to create and build a new
       kernel.

     * How to install the new kernel.

     * How to create any entries in /dev that may be required.

     * How to troubleshoot if things go wrong.

9.2 Why Build a Custom Kernel?

   Traditionally, DragonFly has had what is called a ``monolithic'' kernel.
   This means that the kernel was one large program, supported a fixed list
   of devices, and if you wanted to change the kernel's behavior then you had
   to compile a new kernel, and then reboot your computer with the new
   kernel.

   Today, DragonFly is rapidly moving to a model where much of the kernel's
   functionality is contained in modules which can be dynamically loaded and
   unloaded from the kernel as necessary. This allows the kernel to adapt to
   new hardware suddenly becoming available (such as PCMCIA cards in a
   laptop), or for new functionality to be brought into the kernel that was
   not necessary when the kernel was originally compiled. This is known as a
   modular kernel. Colloquially these are called KLDs.

   Despite this, it is still necessary to carry out some static kernel
   configuration. In some cases this is because the functionality is so tied
   to the kernel that it can not be made dynamically loadable. In others it
   may simply be because no one has yet taken the time to write a dynamic
   loadable kernel module for that functionality yet.

   Building a custom kernel is one of the most important rites of passage
   nearly every UNIX user must endure. This process, while time consuming,
   will provide many benefits to your DragonFly system. Unlike the GENERIC
   kernel, which must support a wide range of hardware, a custom kernel only
   contains support for your PC's hardware. This has a number of benefits,
   such as:

     * Faster boot time. Since the kernel will only probe the hardware you
       have on your system, the time it takes your system to boot will
       decrease dramatically.

     * Less memory usage. A custom kernel often uses less memory than the
       GENERIC kernel, which is important because the kernel must always be
       present in real memory. For this reason, a custom kernel is especially
       useful on a system with a small amount of RAM.

     * Additional hardware support. A custom kernel allows you to add in
       support for devices such as sound cards, which are not present in the
       GENERIC kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.3 Building and Installing a Custom Kernel

   First, let us take a quick tour of the kernel build directory. All
   directories mentioned will be relative to the main /usr/src/sys directory,
   which is also accessible through /sys. There are a number of
   subdirectories here representing different parts of the kernel, but the
   most important, for our purposes, are arch/conf, where you will edit your
   custom kernel configuration, and compile, which is the staging area where
   your kernel will be built. arch represents either i386 or amd64, at this
   point in development. Everything inside a particular architecture's
   directory deals with that architecture only; the rest of the code is
   common to all platforms to which DragonFly could potentially be ported.
   Notice the logical organization of the directory structure, with each
   supported device, file system, and option in its own subdirectory.

     Note: If there is not a /usr/src/sys directory on your system, then the
     kernel source has not been installed. The easiest way to do this is via
     cvsup.

   Next, move to the arch/conf directory and copy the GENERIC configuration
   file to the name you want to give your kernel. For example:

 # cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf
 # cp GENERIC MYKERNEL

   Traditionally, this name is in all capital letters and, if you are
   maintaining multiple DragonFly machines with different hardware, it is a
   good idea to name it after your machine's hostname. We will call it
   MYKERNEL for the purpose of this example.

     Tip: Storing your kernel config file directly under /usr/src can be a
     bad idea. If you are experiencing problems it can be tempting to just
     delete /usr/src and start again. Five seconds after you do that you
     realize that you have deleted your custom kernel config file. Do not
     edit GENERIC directly, as it may get overwritten the next time you
     update your source tree, and your kernel modifications will be lost.

     You might want to keep your kernel config file elsewhere, and then
     create a symbolic link to the file in the i386 directory.

     For example:

 # cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf
 # mkdir /root/kernels
 # cp GENERIC /root/kernels/MYKERNEL    
 # ln -s /root/kernels/MYKERNEL

     Note: You must execute these and all of the following commands under the
     root account or you will get permission denied errors.

   Now, edit MYKERNEL with your favorite text editor. If you are just
   starting out, the only editor available will probably be vi, which is too
   complex to explain here, but is covered well in many books in the
   bibliography. However, DragonFly does offer an easier editor called ee
   which, if you are a beginner, should be your editor of choice. Feel free
   to change the comment lines at the top to reflect your configuration or
   the changes you have made to differentiate it from GENERIC.

   If you have built a kernel under SunOS(TM) or some other BSD operating
   system, much of this file will be very familiar to you. If you are coming
   from some other operating system such as DOS, on the other hand, the
   GENERIC configuration file might seem overwhelming to you, so follow the
   descriptions in the Configuration File section slowly and carefully.

     Note: Be sure to always check the file /usr/src/UPDATING, before you
     perform any update steps, in the case you sync your source tree with the
     latest sources of the DragonFly project. In this file all important
     issues with updating DragonFly are typed out. /usr/src/UPDATING always
     fits your version of the DragonFly source, and is therefore more
     accurate for new information than the handbook.

   Building a Kernel

    1. Change to the /usr/src directory.

 # cd /usr/src

    2. Compile the kernel.

 # make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL

    3. Install the new kernel.

 # make installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL

   If you have not upgraded your source tree in any way since the last time
   you successfully completed a buildworld-installworld cycle (you have not
   run CVSup), then it is safe to use the quickworld and quickkernel,
   buildworld, buildkernel sequence.

   The new kernel will be copied to the root directory as /kernel and the old
   kernel will be moved to /kernel.old. Now, shutdown the system and reboot
   to use your new kernel. In case something goes wrong, there are some
   troubleshooting instructions at the end of this chapter. Be sure to read
   the section which explains how to recover in case your new kernel does not
   boot.

     Note: If you have added any new devices (such as sound cards), you may
     have to add some device nodes to your /dev directory before you can use
     them. For more information, take a look at Making Device Nodes section
     later on in this chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4 The Configuration File

   The general format of a configuration file is quite simple. Each line
   contains a keyword and one or more arguments. For simplicity, most lines
   only contain one argument. Anything following a # is considered a comment
   and ignored. The following sections describe each keyword, generally in
   the order they are listed in GENERIC, although some related keywords have
   been grouped together in a single section (such as Networking) even though
   they are actually scattered throughout the GENERIC file. An exhaustive
   list of options and more detailed explanations of the device lines is
   present in the LINT configuration file, located in the same directory as
   GENERIC. If you are in doubt as to the purpose or necessity of a line,
   check first in LINT.

   The following is an example GENERIC kernel configuration file with various
   additional comments where needed for clarity. This example should match
   your copy in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC fairly closely. For details of
   all the possible kernel options, see /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT.

 #
 #
 # GENERIC -- Generic kernel configuration file for DragonFly/i386
 #
 # Check the LINT configuration file in sys/i386/conf, for an
 # exhaustive list of options.
 #

   The following are the mandatory keywords required in every kernel you
   build:

 machine         i386

   This is the machine architecture. It must be either i386, or amd64.

 cpu          I386_CPU
 cpu          I486_CPU
 cpu          I586_CPU
 cpu          I686_CPU

   The above option specifies the type of CPU you have in your system. You
   may have multiple instances of the CPU line (i.e., you are not sure
   whether you should use I586_CPU or I686_CPU), however, for a custom
   kernel, it is best to specify only the CPU you have. If you are unsure of
   your CPU type, you can check the /var/run/dmesg.boot file to view your
   boot up messages.

 ident          GENERIC

   This is the identification of the kernel. You should change this to
   whatever you named your kernel, i.e. MYKERNEL if you have followed the
   instructions of the previous examples. The value you put in the ident
   string will print when you boot up the kernel, so it is useful to give the
   new kernel a different name if you want to keep it separate from your
   usual kernel (i.e. you want to build an experimental kernel).

 maxusers          n

   The maxusers option sets the size of a number of important system tables.
   This number is supposed to be roughly equal to the number of simultaneous
   users you expect to have on your machine.

   (Recommended) The system will auto-tune this setting for you if you
   explicitly set it to 0[9]. If you want to manage it yourself you will want
   to set maxusers to at least 4, especially if you are using the X Window
   System or compiling software. The reason is that the most important table
   set by maxusers is the maximum number of processes, which is set to 20 +
   16 * maxusers, so if you set maxusers to 1, then you can only have 36
   simultaneous processes, including the 18 or so that the system starts up
   at boot time, and the 15 or so you will probably create when you start the
   X Window System. Even a simple task like reading a manual page will start
   up nine processes to filter, decompress, and view it. Setting maxusers to
   64 will allow you to have up to 1044 simultaneous processes, which should
   be enough for nearly all uses. If, however, you see the dreaded proc table
   full error when trying to start another program, or are running a server
   with a large number of simultaneous users, you can always increase the
   number and rebuild.

     Note: maxusers does not limit the number of users which can log into
     your machine. It simply sets various table sizes to reasonable values
     considering the maximum number of users you will likely have on your
     system and how many processes each of them will be running. One keyword
     which does limit the number of simultaneous remote logins and X terminal
     windows is pseudo-device pty 16.

 # Floating point support - do not disable.
 device          npx0     at nexus? port IO_NPX irq 13

   npx0 is the interface to the floating point math unit in DragonFly, which
   is either the hardware co-processor or the software math emulator. This is
   not optional.

 # Pseudo devices - the number indicates how many units to allocate.
 pseudo-device   loop          # Network loopback

   This is the generic loopback device for TCP/IP. If you telnet or FTP to
   localhost (a.k.a., 127.0.0.1) it will come back at you through this
   device. This is mandatory.

   Everything that follows is more or less optional. See the notes underneath
   or next to each option for more information.

 #makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          #Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols

   The normal build process of the DragonFly does not include debugging
   information when building the kernel and strips most symbols after the
   resulting kernel is linked, to save some space at the install location. If
   you are going to do tests of kernels in the DEVELOPMENT branch or develop
   changes of your own for the DragonFly kernel, you might want to uncomment
   this line. It will enable the use of the -g option which enables debugging
   information when passed to gcc(1).

 options          MATH_EMULATE      #Support for x87 emulation

   This line allows the kernel to simulate a math co-processor if your
   computer does not have one (386 or 486SX). If you have a 486DX, or a 386
   or 486SX (with a separate 387 or 487 chip), or higher (Pentium,
   Pentium II, etc.), you can comment this line out.

     Note: The normal math co-processor emulation routines that come with
     DragonFly are not very accurate. If you do not have a math co-processor,
     and you need the best accuracy, it is recommended that you change this
     option to GPL_MATH_EMULATE to use the GNU math support, which is not
     included by default for licensing reasons.

 options          INET          #InterNETworking

   Networking support. Leave this in, even if you do not plan to be connected
   to a network. Most programs require at least loopback networking (i.e.,
   making network connections within your PC), so this is essentially
   mandatory.

 options          INET6          #IPv6 communications protocols

   This enables the IPv6 communication protocols.

 options          FFS          #Berkeley Fast Filesystem
 options          FFS_ROOT     #FFS usable as root device [keep this!]

   This is the basic hard drive Filesystem. Leave it in if you boot from the
   hard disk.

 options          UFS_DIRHASH  #Improve performance on big directories

   This option includes functionality to speed up disk operations on large
   directories, at the expense of using additional memory. You would normally
   keep this for a large server, or interactive workstation, and remove it if
   you are using DragonFly on a smaller system where memory is at a premium
   and disk access speed is less important, such as a firewall.

 options          SOFTUPDATES  #Enable FFS Soft Updates support

   This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel, this will help speed up
   write access on the disks. Even when this functionality is provided by the
   kernel, it must be turned on for specific disks. Review the output from
   mount(8) to see if Soft Updates is enabled for your system disks. If you
   do not see the soft-updates option then you will need to activate it using
   the tunefs(8) (for existing filesystems) or newfs(8) (for new filesystems)
   commands.

 options          MFS          #Memory Filesystem
 options          MD_ROOT      #MD is a potential root device

   This is the memory-mapped filesystem. This is basically a RAM disk for
   fast storage of temporary files, useful if you have a lot of swap space
   that you want to take advantage of. A perfect place to mount an MFS
   partition is on the /tmp directory, since many programs store temporary
   data here. To mount an MFS RAM disk on /tmp, add the following line to
   /etc/fstab:

 /dev/ad1s2b     /tmp mfs rw 0 0

   Now you simply need to either reboot, or run the command mount /tmp.

 options          NFS          #Network Filesystem
 options          NFS_ROOT     #NFS usable as root device, NFS required

   The network Filesystem. Unless you plan to mount partitions from a UNIX
   file server over TCP/IP, you can comment these out.

 options          MSDOSFS      #MSDOS Filesystem

   The MS-DOS Filesystem. Unless you plan to mount a DOS formatted hard drive
   partition at boot time, you can safely comment this out. It will be
   automatically loaded the first time you mount a DOS partition, as
   described above. Also, the excellent mtools software (in pkgsrc) allows
   you to access DOS floppies without having to mount and unmount them (and
   does not require MSDOSFS at all).

 options          CD9660       #ISO 9660 Filesystem
 options          CD9660_ROOT  #CD-ROM usable as root, CD9660 required

   The ISO 9660 Filesystem for CDROMs. Comment it out if you do not have a
   CDROM drive or only mount data CDs occasionally (since it will be
   dynamically loaded the first time you mount a data CD). Audio CDs do not
   need this Filesystem.

 options          PROCFS       #Process filesystem

   The process filesystem. This is a ``pretend'' filesystem mounted on /proc
   which allows programs like ps(1) to give you more information on what
   processes are running.

 options          COMPAT_43    #Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP THIS!]

   Compatibility with 4.3BSD. Leave this in; some programs will act strangely
   if you comment this out.

 options          SCSI_DELAY=15000    #Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI

   This causes the kernel to pause for 15 seconds before probing each SCSI
   device in your system. If you only have IDE hard drives, you can ignore
   this, otherwise you will probably want to lower this number, perhaps to
   five seconds (5000 ms), to speed up booting. Of course, if you do this,
   and DragonFly has trouble recognizing your SCSI devices, you will have to
   raise it back up.

 options          UCONSOLE            #Allow users to grab the console

   Allow users to grab the console, which is useful for X users. For example,
   you can create a console xterm by typing xterm -C, which will display any
   write(1), talk(1), and any other messages you receive, as well as any
   console messages sent by the kernel.

 options          USERCONFIG          #boot -c editor

   This option allows you to boot the configuration editor from the boot
   menu.

 options          VISUAL_USERCONFIG   #visual boot -c editor

   This option allows you to boot the visual configuration editor from the
   boot menu.

 options          KTRACE              #ktrace(1) support

   This enables kernel process tracing, which is useful in debugging.

 options          SYSVSHM             #SYSV-style shared memory

   This option provides for System V shared memory. The most common use of
   this is the XSHM extension in X, which many graphics-intensive programs
   will automatically take advantage of for extra speed. If you use X, you
   will definitely want to include this.

 options          SYSVSEM             #SYSV-style semaphores

   Support for System V semaphores. Less commonly used but only adds a few
   hundred bytes to the kernel.

 options          SYSVMSG             #SYSV-style message queues

   Support for System V messages. Again, only adds a few hundred bytes to the
   kernel.

     Note: The ipcs(1) command will list any processes using each of these
     System V facilities.

 options         P1003_1B                #Posix P1003_1B real-time extensions
 options         _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING

   Real-time extensions added in the 1993 POSIX(R). Certain applications in
   the ports collection use these (such as StarOffice).

 options         ICMP_BANDLIM            #Rate limit bad replies

   This option enables ICMP error response bandwidth limiting. You typically
   want this option as it will help protect the machine from denial of
   service packet attacks.

 # To make an SMP kernel, the next two are needed
 #options        SMP                     # Symmetric MultiProcessor Kernel
 #options        APIC_IO                 # Symmetric (APIC) I/O

   The above are both required for SMP support.

 device          isa

   All PCs supported by DragonFly have one of these. Do not remove, even if
   you have no ISA slots. If you have an IBM PS/2 (Micro Channel
   Architecture), DragonFly provides some limited support at this time. For
   more information about the MCA support, see /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT.

 device          eisa

   Include this if you have an EISA motherboard. This enables auto-detection
   and configuration support for all devices on the EISA bus.

 device          pci

   Include this if you have a PCI motherboard. This enables auto-detection of
   PCI cards and gatewaying from the PCI to ISA bus.

 device          agp

   Include this if you have an AGP card in the system. This will enable
   support for AGP, and AGP GART for boards which have these features.

 # Floppy drives
 device          fdc0        at isa? port IO_FD1 irq 6 drq 2
 device          fd0         at fdc0 drive 0
 device          fd1         at fdc0 drive 1

   This is the floppy drive controller. fd0 is the A: floppy drive, and fd1
   is the B: drive.

 device          ata

   This driver supports all ATA and ATAPI devices. You only need one device
   ata line for the kernel to detect all PCI ATA/ATAPI devices on modern
   machines.

 device          atadisk                 # ATA disk drives

   This is needed along with device ata for ATA disk drives.

 device          atapicd                 # ATAPI CDROM drives

   This is needed along with device ata for ATAPI CDROM drives.

 device          atapifd                 # ATAPI floppy drives

   This is needed along with device ata for ATAPI floppy drives.

 device          atapist                 # ATAPI tape drives

   This is needed along with device ata for ATAPI tape drives.

 options         ATA_STATIC_ID           #Static device numbering

   This makes the controller number static (like the old driver) or else the
   device numbers are dynamically allocated.

 # ATA and ATAPI devices
 device          ata0        at isa? port IO_WD1 irq 14
 device          ata1        at isa? port IO_WD2 irq 15

   Use the above for older, non-PCI systems.

 # SCSI Controllers

 device          aic0       at isa?

   SCSI controllers. Comment out any you do not have in your system. If you
   have an IDE only system, you can remove these altogether.

 # SCSI peripherals
 device          scbus      # SCSI bus (required)
 device          da         # Direct Access (disks)
 device          sa         # Sequential Access (tape etc)
 device          cd         # CD
 device          pass       # Passthrough device (direct SCSI
 access)

   SCSI peripherals. Again, comment out any you do not have, or if you have
   only IDE hardware, you can remove them completely.

     Note: The USB umass(4) driver (and a few other drivers) use the SCSI
     subsystem even though they are not real SCSI devices. Therefore make
     sure not to remove SCSI support, if any such drivers are included in the
     kernel configuration.

 # RAID controllers
 device          ida        # Compaq Smart RAID
 device          amr        # AMI MegaRAID
 device          mlx        # Mylex DAC960 family

   Supported RAID controllers. If you do not have any of these, you can
   comment them out or remove them.

 # atkbdc0 controls both the keyboard and the PS/2 mouse
 device          atkbdc0    at isa? port IO_KBD

   The keyboard controller (atkbdc) provides I/O services for the AT keyboard
   and PS/2 style pointing devices. This controller is required by the
   keyboard driver (atkbd) and the PS/2 pointing device driver (psm).

 device          atkbd0     at atkbdc? irq 1

   The atkbd driver, together with atkbdc controller, provides access to the
   AT 84 keyboard or the AT enhanced keyboard which is connected to the AT
   keyboard controller.

 device          psm0       at atkbdc? irq 12

   Use this device if your mouse plugs into the PS/2 mouse port.

 device          vga0        at isa?

   The video card driver.

 # splash screen/screen saver
 pseudo-device          splash

   Splash screen at start up! Screen savers require this too.

 # syscons is the default console driver, resembling an SCO console
 device          sc0          at isa?

   sc0 is the default console driver, which resembles a SCO console. Since
   most full-screen programs access the console through a terminal database
   library like termcap, it should not matter whether you use this or vt0,
   the VT220 compatible console driver. When you log in, set your TERM
   variable to scoansi if full-screen programs have trouble running under
   this console.

 # Enable this and PCVT_FREEBSD for pcvt vt220 compatible console driver
 #device          vt0     at isa?
 #options         XSERVER          # support for X server on a vt console
 #options         FAT_CURSOR       # start with block cursor
 # If you have a ThinkPAD, uncomment this along with the rest of the PCVT lines
 #options         PCVT_SCANSET=2   # IBM keyboards are non-std

   This is a VT220-compatible console driver, backward compatible to
   VT100/102. It works well on some laptops which have hardware
   incompatibilities with sc0. Also set your TERM variable to vt100 or vt220
   when you log in. This driver might also prove useful when connecting to a
   large number of different machines over the network, where termcap or
   terminfo entries for the sc0 device are often not available -- vt100

 device          sio2     at isa? disable port IO_COM3 irq 5
 device          sio3     at isa? disable port IO_COM4 irq 9

   These are the four serial ports referred to as COM1 through COM4 in the
   MS-DOS/Windows world.

     Note: If you have an internal modem on COM4 and a serial port at COM2,
     you will have to change the IRQ of the modem to 2 (for obscure technical
     reasons, IRQ2 = IRQ 9) in order to access it from DragonFly. If you have
     a multiport serial card, check the manual page for sio(4) for more
     information on the proper values for these lines. Some video cards
     (notably those based on S3 chips) use IO addresses in the form of
     0x*2e8, and since many cheap serial cards do not fully decode the 16-bit
     IO address space, they clash with these cards making the COM4 port
     practically unavailable.

     Each serial port is required to have a unique IRQ (unless you are using
     one of the multiport cards where shared interrupts are supported), so
     the default IRQs for COM3 and COM4 cannot be used.

 pseudo-device   ether         # Ethernet support

   ether is only needed if you have an Ethernet card. It includes generic
   Ethernet protocol code.

 pseudo-device   sl      1     # Kernel SLIP

   sl is for SLIP support. This has been almost entirely supplanted by PPP,
   which is easier to set up, better suited for modem-to-modem connection,
   and more powerful. The number after sl specifies how many simultaneous
   SLIP sessions to support.

 pseudo-device   ppp     1     # Kernel PPP

   This is for kernel PPP support for dial-up connections. There is also a
   version of PPP implemented as a userland application that uses tun and
   offers more flexibility and features such as demand dialing. The number
   after ppp specifies how many simultaneous PPP connections to support. .

 device   tun           # Packet tunnel.

   This is used by the userland PPP software. A number after tun specifies
   the number of simultaneous PPP sessions to support. See the PPP section of
   this book for more information.

 pseudo-device   pty           # Pseudo-ttys (telnet etc)

   This is a ``pseudo-terminal'' or simulated login port. It is used by
   incoming telnet and rlogin sessions, xterm, and some other applications
   such as Emacs. The number after pty indicates the number of ptys to
   create. If you need more than the default of 16 simultaneous xterm windows
   and/or remote logins, be sure to increase this number accordingly, up to a
   maximum of 256.

 pseudo-device   md            # Memory ``disks''

   Memory disk pseudo-devices.

 pseudo-device   gif     # IPv6 and IPv4 tunneling

   This implements IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling, IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling, IPv4
   over IPv4 tunneling, and IPv6 over IPv6 tunneling.

 pseudo-device   faith   # IPv6-to-IPv4 relaying (translation)

   This pseudo-device captures packets that are sent to it and diverts them
   to the IPv4/IPv6 translation daemon.

 # The `bpf' device enables the Berkeley Packet Filter.
 # Be aware of the administrative consequences of enabling this!
 pseudo-device   bpf           # Berkeley packet filter

   This is the Berkeley Packet Filter. This pseudo-device allows network
   interfaces to be placed in promiscuous mode, capturing every packet on a
   broadcast network (e.g., an Ethernet). These packets can be captured to
   disk and or examined with the tcpdump(1) program.

     Note: The bpf(4) device is also used by dhclient(8) to obtain the IP
     address of the default router (gateway) and so on. If you use DHCP,
     leave this uncommented.

9.5 Making Device Nodes

   Almost every device in the kernel has a corresponding ``node'' entry in
   the /dev directory. These nodes look like regular files, but are actually
   special entries into the kernel which programs use to access the device.
   The shell script /dev/MAKEDEV, which is executed when you first install
   the operating system, creates nearly all of the device nodes supported.
   However, it does not create all of them, so when you add support for a new
   device, it pays to make sure that the appropriate entries are in this
   directory, and if not, add them. Here is a simple example:

   Suppose you add the IDE CD-ROM support to the kernel. The line to add is:

 device acd0

   This means that you should look for some entries that start with acd0 in
   the /dev directory, possibly followed by a letter, such as c, or preceded
   by the letter r, which means a ``raw'' device. It turns out that those
   files are not there, so you must change to the /dev directory and type:

 # sh MAKEDEV acd0

   When this script finishes, you will find that there are now acd0c and
   racd0c entries in /dev so you know that it executed correctly.

   For sound cards, the following command creates the appropriate entries:

 # sh MAKEDEV snd0

     Note: When creating device nodes for devices such as sound cards, if
     other people have access to your machine, it may be desirable to protect
     the devices from outside access by adding them to the /etc/fbtab file.
     See fbtab(5) for more information.

   Follow this simple procedure for any other non-GENERIC devices which do
   not have entries.

     Note: All SCSI controllers use the same set of /dev entries, so you do
     not need to create these. Also, network cards and SLIP/PPP
     pseudo-devices do not have entries in /dev at all, so you do not have to
     worry about these either.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.6 If Something Goes Wrong

   There are five categories of trouble that can occur when building a custom
   kernel. They are:

   config fails:

           If the config(8) command fails when you give it your kernel
           description, you have probably made a simple error somewhere.
           Fortunately, config(8) will print the line number that it had
           trouble with, so you can quickly skip to it with vi. For example,
           if you see:

 config: line 17: syntax error

           You can skip to the problem in vi by typing 17G in command mode.
           Make sure the keyword is typed correctly, by comparing it to the
           GENERIC kernel or another reference.

   make fails:

           If the make command fails, it usually signals an error in your
           kernel description, but not severe enough for config(8) to catch
           it. Again, look over your configuration, and if you still cannot
           resolve the problem, send mail to the DragonFly Bugs mailing list
           with your kernel configuration, and it should be diagnosed very
           quickly.

   Installing the new kernel fails:

           If the kernel compiled fine, but failed to install (the make
           install or make installkernel command failed), the first thing to
           check is if your system is running at securelevel 1 or higher (see
           init(8)). The kernel installation tries to remove the immutable
           flag from your kernel and set the immutable flag on the new one.
           Since securelevel 1 or higher prevents unsetting the immutable
           flag for any files on the system, the kernel installation needs to
           be performed at securelevel 0 or lower.

   The kernel does not boot:

           If your new kernel does not boot, or fails to recognize your
           devices, do not panic! Fortunately, DragonFly has an excellent
           mechanism for recovering from incompatible kernels. Simply choose
           the kernel you want to boot from at the DragonFly boot loader. You
           can access this when the system counts down from 10. Hit any key
           except for the Enter key, type unload and then type boot
           kernel.old, or the filename of any other kernel that will boot
           properly. When reconfiguring a kernel, it is always a good idea to
           keep a kernel that is known to work on hand.

           After booting with a good kernel you can check over your
           configuration file and try to build it again. One helpful resource
           is the /var/log/messages file which records, among other things,
           all of the kernel messages from every successful boot. Also, the
           dmesg(8) command will print the kernel messages from the current
           boot.

             Note: If you are having trouble building a kernel, make sure to
             keep a GENERIC, or some other kernel that is known to work on
             hand as a different name that will not get erased on the next
             build. You cannot rely on kernel.old because when installing a
             new kernel, kernel.old is overwritten with the last installed
             kernel which may be non-functional. Also, as soon as possible,
             move the working kernel to the proper kernel location or
             commands such as ps(1) will not work properly. The proper
             command to ``unlock'' the kernel file that make installs (in
             order to move another kernel back permanently) is:

 # chflags noschg /kernel

             If you find you cannot do this, you are probably running at a
             securelevel(8) greater than zero. Edit kern_securelevel in
             /etc/rc.conf and set it to -1, then reboot. You can change it
             back to its previous setting when you are happy with your new
             kernel.

             And, if you want to ``lock'' your new kernel into place, or any
             file for that matter, so that it cannot be moved or tampered
             with:

 # chflags schg /kernel

   The kernel works, but ps(1) does not work any more:

           If you have installed a different version of the kernel from the
           one that the system utilities have been built with, many
           system-status commands like ps(1) and vmstat(8) will not work any
           more. You must recompile the libkvm library as well as these
           utilities. This is one reason it is not normally a good idea to
           use a different version of the kernel from the rest of the
           operating system.

   ``friendly'' place in which everyone wants to be your kind neighbor.
   Securing your system is imperative to protect your data, intellectual
   property, time, and much more from the hands of hackers and the like.

   DragonFly provides an array of utilities and mechanisms to ensure the
   integrity and security of your system and network.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * Basic system security concepts, in respect to DragonFly.

     * About the various crypt mechanisms available in DragonFly, such as DES
       and MD5.

10.2 Introduction

   Security is a function that begins and ends with the system administrator.
   While all BSD UNIX multi-user systems have some inherent security, the job
   of building and maintaining additional security mechanisms to keep those
   users ``honest'' is probably one of the single largest undertakings of the
   sysadmin. Machines are only as secure as you make them, and security
   concerns are ever competing with the human necessity for convenience. UNIX
   systems, in general, are capable of running a huge number of simultaneous
   processes and many of these processes operate as servers -- meaning that
   external entities can connect and talk to them. As yesterday's
   mini-computers and mainframes become today's desktops, and as computers
   become networked and internetworked, security becomes an even bigger
   issue.

   Security is best implemented through a layered ``onion'' approach. In a
   nutshell, what you want to do is to create as many layers of security as
   are convenient and then carefully monitor the system for intrusions. You
   do not want to overbuild your security or you will interfere with the
   detection side, and detection is one of the single most important aspects
   of any security mechanism. For example, it makes little sense to set the
   schg flags (see chflags(1)) on every system binary because while this may
   temporarily protect the binaries, it prevents an attacker who has broken
   in from making an easily detectable change that may result in your
   security mechanisms not detecting the attacker at all.

   System security also pertains to dealing with various forms of attack,
   including attacks that attempt to crash, or otherwise make a system
   unusable, but do not attempt to compromise the root account (``break
   root''). Security concerns can be split up into several categories:

    1. Denial of service attacks.

    2. User account compromises.

    3. Root compromise through accessible servers.

    4. Root compromise via user accounts.

    5. Backdoor creation.

   A denial of service attack is an action that deprives the machine of
   needed resources. Typically, DoS attacks are brute-force mechanisms that
   attempt to crash or otherwise make a machine unusable by overwhelming its
   servers or network stack. Some DoS attacks try to take advantage of bugs
   in the networking stack to crash a machine with a single packet. The
   latter can only be fixed by applying a bug fix to the kernel. Attacks on
   servers can often be fixed by properly specifying options to limit the
   load the servers incur on the system under adverse conditions. Brute-force
   network attacks are harder to deal with. A spoofed-packet attack, for
   example, is nearly impossible to stop, short of cutting your system off
   from the Internet. It may not be able to take your machine down, but it
   can saturate your Internet connection.

   A user account compromise is even more common than a DoS attack. Many
   sysadmins still run standard telnetd, rlogind, rshd, and ftpd servers on
   their machines. These servers, by default, do not operate over encrypted
   connections. The result is that if you have any moderate-sized user base,
   one or more of your users logging into your system from a remote location
   (which is the most common and convenient way to login to a system) will
   have his or her password sniffed. The attentive system admin will analyze
   his remote access logs looking for suspicious source addresses even for
   successful logins.

   One must always assume that once an attacker has access to a user account,
   the attacker can break root. However, the reality is that in a well
   secured and maintained system, access to a user account does not
   necessarily give the attacker access to root. The distinction is important
   because without access to root the attacker cannot generally hide his
   tracks and may, at best, be able to do nothing more than mess with the
   user's files, or crash the machine. User account compromises are very
   common because users tend not to take the precautions that sysadmins take.

   System administrators must keep in mind that there are potentially many
   ways to break root on a machine. The attacker may know the root password,
   the attacker may find a bug in a root-run server and be able to break root
   over a network connection to that server, or the attacker may know of a
   bug in a suid-root program that allows the attacker to break root once he
   has broken into a user's account. If an attacker has found a way to break
   root on a machine, the attacker may not have a need to install a backdoor.
   Many of the root holes found and closed to date involve a considerable
   amount of work by the attacker to cleanup after himself, so most attackers
   install backdoors. A backdoor provides the attacker with a way to easily
   regain root access to the system, but it also gives the smart system
   administrator a convenient way to detect the intrusion. Making it
   impossible for an attacker to install a backdoor may actually be
   detrimental to your security, because it will not close off the hole the
   attacker found to break in the first place.

   Security remedies should always be implemented with a multi-layered
   ``onion peel'' approach and can be categorized as follows:

    1. Securing root and staff accounts.

    2. Securing root -- root-run servers and suid/sgid binaries.

    3. Securing user accounts.

    4. Securing the password file.

    5. Securing the kernel core, raw devices, and filesystems.

    6. Quick detection of inappropriate changes made to the system.

    7. Paranoia.

   The next section of this chapter will cover the above bullet items in
   greater depth.

10.3 Securing DragonFly

     Command vs. Protocol: Throughout this document, we will use bold text to
     refer to a command or application. This is used for instances such as
     ssh, since it is a protocol as well as command.

   The sections that follow will cover the methods of securing your DragonFly
   system that were mentioned in the last section of this chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.1 Securing the root Account and Staff Accounts

   First off, do not bother securing staff accounts if you have not secured
   the root account. Most systems have a password assigned to the root
   account. The first thing you do is assume that the password is always
   compromised. This does not mean that you should remove the password. The
   password is almost always necessary for console access to the machine.
   What it does mean is that you should not make it possible to use the
   password outside of the console or possibly even with the su(1) command.
   For example, make sure that your pty's are specified as being insecure in
   the /etc/ttys file so that direct root logins via telnet or rlogin are
   disallowed. If using other login services such as sshd, make sure that
   direct root logins are disabled there as well. You can do this by editing
   your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and making sure that PermitRootLogin is
   set to NO. Consider every access method -- services such as FTP often fall
   through the cracks. Direct root logins should only be allowed via the
   system console.

   Of course, as a sysadmin you have to be able to get to root, so we open up
   a few holes. But we make sure these holes require additional password
   verification to operate. One way to make root accessible is to add
   appropriate staff accounts to the wheel group (in /etc/group). The staff
   members placed in the wheel group are allowed to su to root. You should
   never give staff members native wheel access by putting them in the wheel
   group in their password entry. Staff accounts should be placed in a staff
   group, and then added to the wheel group via the /etc/group file. Only
   those staff members who actually need to have root access should be placed
   in the wheel group. It is also possible, when using an authentication
   method such as Kerberos, to use Kerberos' .k5login file in the root
   account to allow a ksu(1) to root without having to place anyone at all in
   the wheel group. This may be the better solution since the wheel mechanism
   still allows an intruder to break root if the intruder has gotten hold of
   your password file and can break into a staff account. While having the
   wheel mechanism is better than having nothing at all, it is not
   necessarily the safest option.

   An indirect way to secure staff accounts, and ultimately root access is to
   use an alternative login access method and do what is known as
   ``starring'' out the encrypted password for the staff accounts. Using the
   vipw(8) command, one can replace each instance of an encrypted password
   with a single ``*'' character. This command will update the
   /etc/master.passwd file and user/password database to disable
   password-authenticated logins.

   A staff account entry such as:

 foobar:R9DT/Fa1/LV9U:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh

   Should be changed to this:

 foobar:*:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh

   This change will prevent normal logins from occurring, since the encrypted
   password will never match ``*''. With this done, staff members must use
   another mechanism to authenticate themselves such as kerberos(1) or ssh(1)
   using a public/private key pair. When using something like Kerberos, one
   generally must secure the machines which run the Kerberos servers and your
   desktop workstation. When using a public/private key pair with ssh, one
   must generally secure the machine used to login from (typically one's
   workstation). An additional layer of protection can be added to the key
   pair by password protecting the key pair when creating it with
   ssh-keygen(1). Being able to ``star'' out the passwords for staff accounts
   also guarantees that staff members can only login through secure access
   methods that you have set up. This forces all staff members to use secure,
   encrypted connections for all of their sessions, which closes an important
   hole used by many intruders: sniffing the network from an unrelated, less
   secure machine.

   The more indirect security mechanisms also assume that you are logging in
   from a more restrictive server to a less restrictive server. For example,
   if your main box is running all sorts of servers, your workstation should
   not be running any. In order for your workstation to be reasonably secure
   you should run as few servers as possible, up to and including no servers
   at all, and you should run a password-protected screen blanker. Of course,
   given physical access to a workstation an attacker can break any sort of
   security you put on it. This is definitely a problem that you should
   consider, but you should also consider the fact that the vast majority of
   break-ins occur remotely, over a network, from people who do not have
   physical access to your workstation or servers.

   Using something like Kerberos also gives you the ability to disable or
   change the password for a staff account in one place, and have it
   immediately affect all the machines on which the staff member may have an
   account. If a staff member's account gets compromised, the ability to
   instantly change his password on all machines should not be underrated.
   With discrete passwords, changing a password on N machines can be a mess.
   You can also impose re-passwording restrictions with Kerberos: not only
   can a Kerberos ticket be made to timeout after a while, but the Kerberos
   system can require that the user choose a new password after a certain
   period of time (say, once a month).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.2 Securing Root-run Servers and SUID/SGID Binaries

   The prudent sysadmin only runs the servers he needs to, no more, no less.
   Be aware that third party servers are often the most bug-prone. For
   example, running an old version of imapd or popper is like giving a
   universal root ticket out to the entire world. Never run a server that you
   have not checked out carefully. Many servers do not need to be run as
   root. For example, the ntalk, comsat, and finger daemons can be run in
   special user sandboxes. A sandbox is not perfect, unless you go through a
   large amount of trouble, but the onion approach to security still stands:
   If someone is able to break in through a server running in a sandbox, they
   still have to break out of the sandbox. The more layers the attacker must
   break through, the lower the likelihood of his success. Root holes have
   historically been found in virtually every server ever run as root,
   including basic system servers. If you are running a machine through which
   people only login via sshd and never login via telnetd or rshd or rlogind,
   then turn off those services!

   DragonFly now defaults to running ntalkd, comsat, and finger in a sandbox.
   Another program which may be a candidate for running in a sandbox is
   named(8). /etc/defaults/rc.conf includes the arguments necessary to run
   named in a sandbox in a commented-out form. Depending on whether you are
   installing a new system or upgrading an existing system, the special user
   accounts used by these sandboxes may not be installed. The prudent
   sysadmin would research and implement sandboxes for servers whenever
   possible.

   There are a number of other servers that typically do not run in
   sandboxes: sendmail, popper, imapd, ftpd, and others. There are
   alternatives to some of these, but installing them may require more work
   than you are willing to perform (the convenience factor strikes again).
   You may have to run these servers as root and rely on other mechanisms to
   detect break-ins that might occur through them.

   The other big potential root holes in a system are the suid-root and sgid
   binaries installed on the system. Most of these binaries, such as rlogin,
   reside in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin. While nothing is 100% safe,
   the system-default suid and sgid binaries can be considered reasonably
   safe. Still, root holes are occasionally found in these binaries. A root
   hole was found in Xlib in 1998 that made xterm (which is typically suid)
   vulnerable. It is better to be safe than sorry and the prudent sysadmin
   will restrict suid binaries, that only staff should run, to a special
   group that only staff can access, and get rid of (chmod 000) any suid
   binaries that nobody uses. A server with no display generally does not
   need an xterm binary. Sgid binaries can be almost as dangerous. If an
   intruder can break an sgid-kmem binary, the intruder might be able to read
   /dev/kmem and thus read the encrypted password file, potentially
   compromising any passworded account. Alternatively an intruder who breaks
   group kmem can monitor keystrokes sent through pty's, including pty's used
   by users who login through secure methods. An intruder that breaks the tty
   group can write to almost any user's tty. If a user is running a terminal
   program or emulator with a keyboard-simulation feature, the intruder can
   potentially generate a data stream that causes the user's terminal to echo
   a command, which is then run as that user.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.3 Securing User Accounts

   User accounts are usually the most difficult to secure. While you can
   impose Draconian access restrictions on your staff and ``star'' out their
   passwords, you may not be able to do so with any general user accounts you
   might have. If you do have sufficient control, then you may win out and be
   able to secure the user accounts properly. If not, you simply have to be
   more vigilant in your monitoring of those accounts. Use of ssh and
   Kerberos for user accounts is more problematic, due to the extra
   administration and technical support required, but still a very good
   solution compared to a crypted password file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.4 Securing the Password File

   The only sure fire way is to * out as many passwords as you can and use
   ssh or Kerberos for access to those accounts. Even though the encrypted
   password file (/etc/spwd.db) can only be read by root, it may be possible
   for an intruder to obtain read access to that file even if the attacker
   cannot obtain root-write access.

   Your security scripts should always check for and report changes to the
   password file (see the Checking file integrity section below).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.5 Securing the Kernel Core, Raw Devices, and Filesystems

   If an attacker breaks root he can do just about anything, but there are
   certain conveniences. For example, most modern kernels have a packet
   sniffing device driver built in. Under DragonFly it is called the bpf
   device. An intruder will commonly attempt to run a packet sniffer on a
   compromised machine. You do not need to give the intruder the capability
   and most systems do not have the need for the bpf device compiled in.

   But even if you turn off the bpf device, you still have /dev/mem and
   /dev/kmem to worry about. For that matter, the intruder can still write to
   raw disk devices. Also, there is another kernel feature called the module
   loader, kldload(8). An enterprising intruder can use a KLD module to
   install his own bpf device, or other sniffing device, on a running kernel.
   To avoid these problems you have to run the kernel at a higher secure
   level, at least securelevel 1. The securelevel can be set with a sysctl on
   the kern.securelevel variable. Once you have set the securelevel to 1,
   write access to raw devices will be denied and special chflags flags, such
   as schg, will be enforced. You must also ensure that the schg flag is set
   on critical startup binaries, directories, and script files -- everything
   that gets run up to the point where the securelevel is set. This might be
   overdoing it, and upgrading the system is much more difficult when you
   operate at a higher secure level. You may compromise and run the system at
   a higher secure level but not set the schg flag for every system file and
   directory under the sun. Another possibility is to simply mount / and /usr
   read-only. It should be noted that being too Draconian in what you attempt
   to protect may prevent the all-important detection of an intrusion.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.6 Checking File Integrity: Binaries, Configuration Files, Etc.

   When it comes right down to it, you can only protect your core system
   configuration and control files so much before the convenience factor
   rears its ugly head. For example, using chflags to set the schg bit on
   most of the files in / and /usr is probably counterproductive, because
   while it may protect the files, it also closes a detection window. The
   last layer of your security onion is perhaps the most important --
   detection. The rest of your security is pretty much useless (or, worse,
   presents you with a false sense of safety) if you cannot detect potential
   incursions. Half the job of the onion is to slow down the attacker, rather
   than stop him, in order to give the detection side of the equation a
   chance to catch him in the act.

   The best way to detect an incursion is to look for modified, missing, or
   unexpected files. The best way to look for modified files is from another
   (often centralized) limited-access system. Writing your security scripts
   on the extra-secure limited-access system makes them mostly invisible to
   potential attackers, and this is important. In order to take maximum
   advantage you generally have to give the limited-access box significant
   access to the other machines in the business, usually either by doing a
   read-only NFS export of the other machines to the limited-access box, or
   by setting up ssh key-pairs to allow the limited-access box to ssh to the
   other machines. Except for its network traffic, NFS is the least visible
   method -- allowing you to monitor the filesystems on each client box
   virtually undetected. If your limited-access server is connected to the
   client boxes through a switch, the NFS method is often the better choice.
   If your limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a
   hub, or through several layers of routing, the NFS method may be too
   insecure (network-wise) and using ssh may be the better choice even with
   the audit-trail tracks that ssh lays.

   Once you give a limited-access box, at least read access to the client
   systems it is supposed to monitor, you must write scripts to do the actual
   monitoring. Given an NFS mount, you can write scripts out of simple system
   utilities such as find(1) and md5(1). It is best to physically md5 the
   client-box files at least once a day, and to test control files such as
   those found in /etc and /usr/local/etc even more often. When mismatches
   are found, relative to the base md5 information the limited-access machine
   knows is valid, it should scream at a sysadmin to go check it out. A good
   security script will also check for inappropriate suid binaries and for
   new or deleted files on system partitions such as / and /usr.

   When using ssh rather than NFS, writing the security script is much more
   difficult. You essentially have to scp the scripts to the client box in
   order to run them, making them visible, and for safety you also need to
   scp the binaries (such as find) that those scripts use. The ssh client on
   the client box may already be compromised. All in all, using ssh may be
   necessary when running over insecure links, but it is also a lot harder to
   deal with.

   A good security script will also check for changes to user and staff
   members access configuration files: .rhosts, .shosts, .ssh/authorized_keys
   and so forth... files that might fall outside the purview of the MD5
   check.

   If you have a huge amount of user disk space, it may take too long to run
   through every file on those partitions. In this case, setting mount flags
   to disallow suid binaries and devices on those partitions is a good idea.
   The nodev and nosuid options (see mount(8)) are what you want to look
   into. You should probably scan them anyway, at least once a week, since
   the object of this layer is to detect a break-in whether or not the
   break-in is effective.

   Process accounting (see accton(8)) is a relatively low-overhead feature of
   the operating system which might help as a post-break-in evaluation
   mechanism. It is especially useful in tracking down how an intruder has
   actually broken into a system, assuming the file is still intact after the
   break-in occurs.

   Finally, security scripts should process the log files, and the logs
   themselves should be generated in as secure a manner as possible -- remote
   syslog can be very useful. An intruder tries to cover his tracks, and log
   files are critical to the sysadmin trying to track down the time and
   method of the initial break-in. One way to keep a permanent record of the
   log files is to run the system console to a serial port and collect the
   information on a continuing basis through a secure machine monitoring the
   consoles.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.7 Paranoia

   A little paranoia never hurts. As a rule, a sysadmin can add any number of
   security features, as long as they do not affect convenience, and can add
   security features that do affect convenience with some added thought. Even
   more importantly, a security administrator should mix it up a bit -- if
   you use recommendations such as those given by this document verbatim, you
   give away your methodologies to the prospective attacker who also has
   access to this document.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.8 Denial of Service Attacks

   This section covers Denial of Service attacks. A DoS attack is typically a
   packet attack. While there is not much you can do about modern spoofed
   packet attacks that saturate your network, you can generally limit the
   damage by ensuring that the attacks cannot take down your servers.

    1. Limiting server forks.

    2. Limiting springboard attacks (ICMP response attacks, ping broadcast,
       etc.).

    3. Kernel Route Cache.

   A common DoS attack is against a forking server that attempts to cause the
   server to eat processes, file descriptors, and memory, until the machine
   dies. inetd (see inetd(8)) has several options to limit this sort of
   attack. It should be noted that while it is possible to prevent a machine
   from going down, it is not generally possible to prevent a service from
   being disrupted by the attack. Read the inetd manual page carefully and
   pay specific attention to the -c, -C, and -R options. Note that spoofed-IP
   attacks will circumvent the -C option to inetd, so typically a combination
   of options must be used. Some standalone servers have self-fork-limitation
   parameters.

   Sendmail has its -OMaxDaemonChildren option, which tends to work much
   better than trying to use sendmail's load limiting options due to the load
   lag. You should specify a MaxDaemonChildren parameter, when you start
   sendmail, high enough to handle your expected load, but not so high that
   the computer cannot handle that number of sendmails without falling on its
   face. It is also prudent to run sendmail in queued mode
   (-ODeliveryMode=queued) and to run the daemon (sendmail -bd) separate from
   the queue-runs (sendmail -q15m). If you still want real-time delivery you
   can run the queue at a much lower interval, such as -q1m, but be sure to
   specify a reasonable MaxDaemonChildren option for that sendmail to prevent
   cascade failures.

   Syslogd can be attacked directly and it is strongly recommended that you
   use the -s option whenever possible, and the -a option otherwise.

   You should also be fairly careful with connect-back services such as
   tcpwrapper's reverse-identd, which can be attacked directly. You generally
   do not want to use the reverse-ident feature of tcpwrappers for this
   reason.

   It is a very good idea to protect internal services from external access
   by firewalling them off at your border routers. The idea here is to
   prevent saturation attacks from outside your LAN, not so much to protect
   internal services from network-based root compromise. Always configure an
   exclusive firewall, i.e., ``firewall everything except ports A, B, C, D,
   and M-Z''. This way you can firewall off all of your low ports except for
   certain specific services such as named (if you are primary for a zone),
   ntalkd, sendmail, and other Internet-accessible services. If you try to
   configure the firewall the other way -- as an inclusive or permissive
   firewall, there is a good chance that you will forget to ``close'' a
   couple of services, or that you will add a new internal service and forget
   to update the firewall. You can still open up the high-numbered port range
   on the firewall, to allow permissive-like operation, without compromising
   your low ports. Also take note that DragonFly allows you to control the
   range of port numbers used for dynamic binding, via the various
   net.inet.ip.portrange sysctl's (sysctl -a | fgrep portrange), which can
   also ease the complexity of your firewall's configuration. For example,
   you might use a normal first/last range of 4000 to 5000, and a hiport
   range of 49152 to 65535, then block off everything under 4000 in your
   firewall (except for certain specific Internet-accessible ports, of
   course).

   Another common DoS attack is called a springboard attack -- to attack a
   server in a manner that causes the server to generate responses which
   overloads the server, the local network, or some other machine. The most
   common attack of this nature is the ICMP ping broadcast attack. The
   attacker spoofs ping packets sent to your LAN's broadcast address with the
   source IP address set to the actual machine they wish to attack. If your
   border routers are not configured to stomp on ping's to broadcast
   addresses, your LAN winds up generating sufficient responses to the
   spoofed source address to saturate the victim, especially when the
   attacker uses the same trick on several dozen broadcast addresses over
   several dozen different networks at once. Broadcast attacks of over a
   hundred and twenty megabits have been measured. A second common
   springboard attack is against the ICMP error reporting system. By
   constructing packets that generate ICMP error responses, an attacker can
   saturate a server's incoming network and cause the server to saturate its
   outgoing network with ICMP responses. This type of attack can also crash
   the server by running it out of mbuf's, especially if the server cannot
   drain the ICMP responses it generates fast enough. The DragonFly kernel
   has a new kernel compile option called ICMP_BANDLIM which limits the
   effectiveness of these sorts of attacks. The last major class of
   springboard attacks is related to certain internal inetd services such as
   the udp echo service. An attacker simply spoofs a UDP packet with the
   source address being server A's echo port, and the destination address
   being server B's echo port, where server A and B are both on your LAN. The
   two servers then bounce this one packet back and forth between each other.
   The attacker can overload both servers and their LANs simply by injecting
   a few packets in this manner. Similar problems exist with the internal
   chargen port. A competent sysadmin will turn off all of these
   inetd-internal test services.

   Spoofed packet attacks may also be used to overload the kernel route
   cache. Refer to the net.inet.ip.rtexpire, rtminexpire, and rtmaxcache
   sysctl parameters. A spoofed packet attack that uses a random source IP
   will cause the kernel to generate a temporary cached route in the route
   table, viewable with netstat -rna | fgrep W3. These routes typically
   timeout in 1600 seconds or so. If the kernel detects that the cached route
   table has gotten too big it will dynamically reduce the rtexpire but will
   never decrease it to less than rtminexpire. There are two problems:

    1. The kernel does not react quickly enough when a lightly loaded server
       is suddenly attacked.

    2. The rtminexpire is not low enough for the kernel to survive a
       sustained attack.

   If your servers are connected to the Internet via a T3 or better, it may
   be prudent to manually override both rtexpire and rtminexpire via
   sysctl(8). Never set either parameter to zero (unless you want to crash
   the machine). Setting both parameters to two seconds should be sufficient
   to protect the route table from attack.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.3.9 Access Issues with Kerberos and SSH

   There are a few issues with both Kerberos and ssh that need to be
   addressed if you intend to use them. Kerberos V is an excellent
   authentication protocol, but there are bugs in the kerberized telnet and
   rlogin applications that make them unsuitable for dealing with binary
   streams. Also, by default Kerberos does not encrypt a session unless you
   use the -x option. ssh encrypts everything by default.

   ssh works quite well in every respect except that it forwards encryption
   keys by default. What this means is that if you have a secure workstation
   holding keys that give you access to the rest of the system, and you ssh
   to an insecure machine, your keys are usable. The actual keys themselves
   are not exposed, but ssh installs a forwarding port for the duration of
   your login, and if an attacker has broken root on the insecure machine he
   can utilize that port to use your keys to gain access to any other machine
   that your keys unlock.

   We recommend that you use ssh in combination with Kerberos whenever
   possible for staff logins. ssh can be compiled with Kerberos support. This
   reduces your reliance on potentially exposable ssh keys while at the same
   time protecting passwords via Kerberos. ssh keys should only be used for
   automated tasks from secure machines (something that Kerberos is unsuited
   to do). We also recommend that you either turn off key-forwarding in the
   ssh configuration, or that you make use of the from=IP/DOMAIN option that
   ssh allows in its authorized_keys file to make the key only usable to
   entities logging in from specific machines.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

10.4 DES, MD5, and Crypt

   Parts rewritten and updated by Bill Swingle.

   Every user on a UNIX system has a password associated with their account.
   It seems obvious that these passwords need to be known only to the user
   and the actual operating system. In order to keep these passwords secret,
   they are encrypted with what is known as a ``one-way hash'', that is, they
   can only be easily encrypted but not decrypted. In other words, what we
   told you a moment ago was obvious is not even true: the operating system
   itself does not really know the password. It only knows the encrypted form
   of the password. The only way to get the ``plain-text'' password is by a
   brute force search of the space of possible passwords.

   Unfortunately the only secure way to encrypt passwords when UNIX came into
   being was based on DES, the Data Encryption Standard. This was not such a
   problem for users resident in the US, but since the source code for DES
   could not be exported outside the US, DragonFly had to find a way to both
   comply with US law and retain compatibility with all the other UNIX
   variants that still used DES.

   The solution was to divide up the encryption libraries so that US users
   could install the DES libraries and use DES but international users still
   had an encryption method that could be exported abroad. This is how
   DragonFly came to use MD5 as its default encryption method. MD5 is
   believed to be more secure than DES, so installing DES is offered
   primarily for compatibility reasons.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.4.1 Recognizing Your Crypt Mechanism

   libcrypt.a provides a configurable password authentication hash library.
   Currently the library supports DES, MD5 and Blowfish hash functions. By
   default DragonFly uses MD5 to encrypt passwords.

   It is pretty easy to identify which encryption method DragonFly is set up
   to use. Examining the encrypted passwords in the /etc/master.passwd file
   is one way. Passwords encrypted with the MD5 hash are longer than those
   encrypted with the DES hash and also begin with the characters $1$.
   Passwords starting with $2a$ are encrypted with the Blowfish hash
   function. DES password strings do not have any particular identifying
   characteristics, but they are shorter than MD5 passwords, and are coded in
   a 64-character alphabet which does not include the $ character, so a
   relatively short string which does not begin with a dollar sign is very
   likely a DES password.

   The password format used for new passwords is controlled by the
   passwd_format login capability in /etc/login.conf, which takes values of
   des, md5 or blf. See the login.conf(5) manual page for more information
   about login capabilities.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

10.5 One-time Passwords

   S/Key is a one-time password scheme based on a one-way hash function.
   DragonFly uses the MD4 hash for compatibility but other systems have used
   MD5 and DES-MAC. S/Key ia part of the FreeBSD base system, and is also
   used on a growing number of other operating systems. S/Key is a registered
   trademark of Bell Communications Research, Inc.

   There are three different sorts of passwords which we will discuss below.
   The first is your usual UNIX style or Kerberos password; we will call this
   a ``UNIX password''. The second sort is the one-time password which is
   generated by the S/Key key program or the OPIE opiekey(1) program and
   accepted by the keyinit or opiepasswd(1) programs and the login prompt; we
   will call this a ``one-time password''. The final sort of password is the
   secret password which you give to the key/opiekey programs (and sometimes
   the keyinit/opiepasswd programs) which it uses to generate one-time
   passwords; we will call it a ``secret password'' or just unqualified
   ``password''.

   The secret password does not have anything to do with your UNIX password;
   they can be the same but this is not recommended. S/Key and OPIE secret
   passwords are not limited to eight characters like old UNIX passwords[10],
   they can be as long as you like. Passwords of six or seven word long
   phrases are fairly common. For the most part, the S/Key or OPIE system
   operates completely independently of the UNIX password system.

   Besides the password, there are two other pieces of data that are
   important to S/Key and OPIE. One is what is known as the ``seed'' or
   ``key'', consisting of two letters and five digits. The other is what is
   called the ``iteration count'', a number between 1 and 100. S/Key creates
   the one-time password by concatenating the seed and the secret password,
   then applying the MD4/MD5 hash as many times as specified by the iteration
   count and turning the result into six short English words. These six
   English words are your one-time password. The authentication system
   (primarily PAM) keeps track of the last one-time password used, and the
   user is authenticated if the hash of the user-provided password is equal
   to the previous password. Because a one-way hash is used it is impossible
   to generate future one-time passwords if a successfully used password is
   captured; the iteration count is decremented after each successful login
   to keep the user and the login program in sync. When the iteration count
   gets down to 1, S/Key and OPIE must be reinitialized.

   There are three programs involved in each system which we will discuss
   below. The key and opiekey programs accept an iteration count, a seed, and
   a secret password, and generate a one-time password or a consecutive list
   of one-time passwords. The keyinit and opiepasswd programs are used to
   initialize S/Key and OPIE respectively, and to change passwords, iteration
   counts, or seeds; they take either a secret passphrase, or an iteration
   count, seed, and one-time password. The keyinfo and opieinfo programs
   examine the relevant credentials files (/etc/skeykeys or /etc/opiekeys)
   and print out the invoking user's current iteration count and seed.

   There are four different sorts of operations we will cover. The first is
   using keyinit or opiepasswd over a secure connection to set up
   one-time-passwords for the first time, or to change your password or seed.
   The second operation is using keyinit or opiepasswd over an insecure
   connection, in conjunction with key or opiekey over a secure connection,
   to do the same. The third is using key/opiekey to log in over an insecure
   connection. The fourth is using key or opiekey to generate a number of
   keys which can be written down or printed out to carry with you when going
   to some location without secure connections to anywhere.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.5.1 Secure Connection Initialization

   To initialize S/Key for the first time, change your password, or change
   your seed while logged in over a secure connection (e.g., on the console
   of a machine or via ssh), use the keyinit command without any parameters
   while logged in as yourself:

 % keyinit
 Adding unfurl:
 Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected.
 If you are using telnet or rlogin exit with no password and use keyinit -s.
 Enter secret password:
 Again secret password:

 ID unfurl s/key is 99 to17757
 DEFY CLUB PRO NASH LACE SOFT

   For OPIE, opiepasswd is used instead:

 % opiepasswd -c
 [grimreaper] ~ $ opiepasswd -f -c
 Adding unfurl:
 Only use this method from the console; NEVER from remote. If you are using
 telnet, xterm, or a dial-in, type ^C now or exit with no password.
 Then run opiepasswd without the -c parameter.
 Using MD5 to compute responses.
 Enter new secret pass phrase:
 Again new secret pass phrase:
 ID unfurl OTP key is 499 to4268
 MOS MALL GOAT ARM AVID COED

   At the Enter new secret pass phrase: or Enter secret password: prompts,
   you should enter a password or phrase. Remember, this is not the password
   that you will use to login with, this is used to generate your one-time
   login keys. The ``ID'' line gives the parameters of your particular
   instance: your login name, the iteration count, and seed. When logging in
   the system will remember these parameters and present them back to you so
   you do not have to remember them. The last line gives the particular
   one-time password which corresponds to those parameters and your secret
   password; if you were to re-login immediately, this one-time password is
   the one you would use.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.5.2 Insecure Connection Initialization

   To initialize or change your secret password over an insecure connection,
   you will need to already have a secure connection to some place where you
   can run key or opiekey; this might be in the form of a desk accessory on a
   Macintosh, or a shell prompt on a machine you trust. You will also need to
   make up an iteration count (100 is probably a good value), and you may
   make up your own seed or use a randomly-generated one. Over on the
   insecure connection (to the machine you are initializing), use the keyinit
   -s command:

 % keyinit -s
 Updating unfurl:
 Old key: to17758
 Reminder you need the 6 English words from the key command.
 Enter sequence count from 1 to 9999: 100
 Enter new key [default to17759]:
 s/key 100 to 17759
 s/key access password:
 s/key access password:CURE MIKE BANE HIM RACY GORE

   For OPIE, you need to use opiepasswd:

 % opiepasswd

 Updating unfurl:
 You need the response from an OTP generator.
 Old secret pass phrase:
         otp-md5 498 to4268 ext
         Response: GAME GAG WELT OUT DOWN CHAT
 New secret pass phrase:
         otp-md5 499 to4269
         Response: LINE PAP MILK NELL BUOY TROY

 ID mark OTP key is 499 gr4269
 LINE PAP MILK NELL BUOY TROY

   To accept the default seed (which the keyinit program confusingly calls a
   key), press Return. Then before entering an access password, move over to
   your secure connection or S/Key desk accessory, and give it the same
   parameters:

 % key 100 to17759
 Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
 Enter secret password: <secret password>
 CURE MIKE BANE HIM RACY GORE

   Or for OPIE:

 % opiekey 498 to4268
 Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
 Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
 Enter secret pass phrase:
 GAME GAG WELT OUT DOWN CHAT

   Now switch back over to the insecure connection, and copy the one-time
   password generated over to the relevant program.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.5.3 Generating a Single One-time Password

   Once you have initialized S/Key, when you login you will be presented with
   a prompt like this:

 % telnet example.com
 Trying 10.0.0.1...
 Connected to example.com
 Escape character is '^]'.

 DragonFly/i386 (example.com) (ttypa)

 login: <username>
 s/key 97 fw13894
 Password:

   Or for OPIE:

 % telnet example.com
 Trying 10.0.0.1...
 Connected to example.com
 Escape character is '^]'.

 DragonFly/i386 (example.com) (ttypa)

 login: <username>
 otp-md5 498 gr4269 ext
 Password:

   As a side note, the S/Key and OPIE prompts have a useful feature (not
   shown here): if you press Return at the password prompt, the prompter will
   turn echo on, so you can see what you are typing. This can be extremely
   useful if you are attempting to type in a password by hand, such as from a
   printout.

   At this point you need to generate your one-time password to answer this
   login prompt. This must be done on a trusted system that you can run key
   or opiekey on. (There are versions of these for DOS, Windows and Mac OS as
   well.) They need both the iteration count and the seed as command line
   options. You can cut-and-paste these right from the login prompt on the
   machine that you are logging in to.

   On the trusted system:

 % key 97 fw13894
 Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
 Enter secret password:
 WELD LIP ACTS ENDS ME HAAG

   For OPIE:

 % opiekey 498 to4268
 Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
 Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
 Enter secret pass phrase:
 GAME GAG WELT OUT DOWN CHAT

   Now that you have your one-time password you can continue logging in:

 login: <username>
 s/key 97 fw13894
 Password: <return to enable echo>
 s/key 97 fw13894
 Password [echo on]: WELD LIP ACTS ENDS ME HAAG
 Last login: Tue Mar 21 11:56:41 from 10.0.0.2 ...

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.5.4 Generating Multiple One-time Passwords

   Sometimes you have to go places where you do not have access to a trusted
   machine or secure connection. In this case, it is possible to use the key
   and opiekey commands to generate a number of one-time passwords beforehand
   to be printed out and taken with you. For example:

 % key -n 5 30 zz99999
 Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
 Enter secret password: <secret password>
 26: SODA RUDE LEA LIND BUDD SILT
 27: JILT SPY DUTY GLOW COWL ROT 
 28: THEM OW COLA RUNT BONG SCOT 
 29: COT MASH BARR BRIM NAN FLAG 
 30: CAN KNEE CAST NAME FOLK BILK

   Or for OPIE:

 % opiekey -n 5 30 zz99999
 Using the MD5 algorithm to compute response.
 Reminder: Don't use opiekey from telnet or dial-in sessions.
 Enter secret pass phrase: <secret password>
 26: JOAN BORE FOSS DES NAY QUIT
 27: LATE BIAS SLAY FOLK MUCH TRIG
 28: SALT TIN ANTI LOON NEAL USE
 29: RIO ODIN GO BYE FURY TIC
 30: GREW JIVE SAN GIRD BOIL PHI

   The -n 5 requests five keys in sequence, the 30 specifies what the last
   iteration number should be. Note that these are printed out in reverse
   order of eventual use. If you are really paranoid, you might want to write
   the results down by hand; otherwise you can cut-and-paste into lpr. Note
   that each line shows both the iteration count and the one-time password;
   you may still find it handy to scratch off passwords as you use them.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.5.5 Restricting Use of UNIX(R) Passwords

   S/Key can place restrictions on the use of UNIX passwords based on the
   host name, user name, terminal port, or IP address of a login session.
   These restrictions can be found in the configuration file
   /etc/skey.access. The skey.access(5) manual page has more information on
   the complete format of the file and also details some security cautions to
   be aware of before depending on this file for security.

   If there is no /etc/skey.access file (this is the default), then all users
   will be allowed to use UNIX passwords. If the file exists, however, then
   all users will be required to use S/Key unless explicitly permitted to do
   otherwise by configuration statements in the skey.access file. In all
   cases, UNIX passwords are permitted on the console.

   Here is a sample skey.access configuration file which illustrates the
   three most common sorts of configuration statements:

 permit internet 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0
 permit user fnord
 permit port ttyd0

   The first line (permit internet) allows users whose IP source address
   (which is vulnerable to spoofing) matches the specified value and mask, to
   use UNIX passwords. This should not be considered a security mechanism,
   but rather, a means to remind authorized users that they are using an
   insecure network and need to use S/Key for authentication.

   The second line (permit user) allows the specified username, in this case
   fnord, to use UNIX passwords at any time. Generally speaking, this should
   only be used for people who are either unable to use the key program, like
   those with dumb terminals, or those who are uneducable.

   The third line (permit port) allows all users logging in on the specified
   terminal line to use UNIX passwords; this would be used for dial-ups.

   Here is a sample opieaccess file:

 permit 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0

   This line allows users whose IP source address (which is vulnerable to
   spoofing) matches the specified value and mask, to use UNIX passwords at
   any time.

   If no rules in opieaccess are matched, the default is to deny non-OPIE
   logins.

10.6 Kerberos5

   Contributed by Tillman Hodgson. Based on a contribution by Mark Murray.

   The following information only applies to Kerberos5. Users who wish to use
   the KerberosIV package may install the security/krb4 port.

   Kerberos is a network add-on system/protocol that allows users to
   authenticate themselves through the services of a secure server. Services
   such as remote login, remote copy, secure inter-system file copying and
   other high-risk tasks are made considerably safer and more controllable.

   Kerberos can be described as an identity-verifying proxy system. It can
   also be described as a trusted third-party authentication system. Kerberos
   provides only one function -- the secure authentication of users on the
   network. It does not provide authorization functions (what users are
   allowed to do) or auditing functions (what those users did). After a
   client and server have used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can
   also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data
   integrity as they go about their business.

   Therefore it is highly recommended that Kerberos be used with other
   security methods which provide authorization and audit services.

   The following instructions can be used as a guide on how to set up
   Kerberos as distributed for DragonFly. However, you should refer to the
   relevant manual pages for a complete description.

   For purposes of demonstrating a Kerberos installation, the various
   namespaces will be handled as follows:

     * The DNS domain (``zone'') will be example.org.

     * The Kerberos realm will be EXAMPLE.ORG.

     Note: Please use real domain names when setting up Kerberos even if you
     intend to run it internally. This avoids DNS problems and assures
     inter-operation with other Kerberos realms.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.1 History

   Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to network security problems.
   The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove
   its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network
   connection.

   Kerberos is both the name of a network authentication protocol and an
   adjective to describe programs that implement the program (Kerberos
   telnet, for example). The current version of the protocol is version 5,
   described in RFC 1510.

   Several free implementations of this protocol are available, covering a
   wide range of operating systems. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   (MIT), where Kerberos was originally developed, continues to develop their
   Kerberos package. It is commonly used in the US as a cryptography product,
   as such it has historically been affected by US export regulations. The
   MIT Kerberos is available as a port (security/krb5). Heimdal Kerberos is
   another version 5 implementation, and was explicitly developed outside of
   the US to avoid export regulations (and is thus often included in
   non-commercial UNIX variants). The Heimdal Kerberos distribution is
   available as a port (security/heimdal), and a minimal installation of it
   is included in the base DragonFly install.

   In order to reach the widest audience, these instructions assume the use
   of the Heimdal distribution included in DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.2 Setting up a Heimdal KDC

   The Key Distribution Center (KDC) is the centralized authentication
   service that Kerberos provides -- it is the computer that issues Kerberos
   tickets. The KDC is considered ``trusted'' by all other computers in the
   Kerberos realm, and thus has heightened security concerns.

   Note that while running the Kerberos server requires very few computing
   resources, a dedicated machine acting only as a KDC is recommended for
   security reasons.

   To begin setting up a KDC, ensure that your /etc/rc.conf file contains the
   correct settings to act as a KDC (you may need to adjust paths to reflect
   your own system):

 kerberos5_server_enable="YES"
 kadmind5_server_enable="YES"
 kerberos_stash="YES"

   Next we will set up your Kerberos config file, /etc/krb5.conf:

 [libdefaults]
     default_realm = EXAMPLE.ORG
 [realms]
     EXAMPLE.ORG = {
         kdc = kerberos.example.org
     }
 [domain_realm]
     .example.org = EXAMPLE.ORG

   Note that this /etc/krb5.conf file implies that your KDC will have the
   fully-qualified hostname of kerberos.example.org. You will need to add a
   CNAME (alias) entry to your zone file to accomplish this if your KDC has a
   different hostname.

     Note: For large networks with a properly configured BIND DNS server, the
     above example could be trimmed to:

 [libdefaults]
       default_realm = EXAMPLE.ORG

     With the following lines being appended to the example.org zonefile:

 _kerberos._udp      IN  SRV     01 00 88 kerberos.example.org.
 _kerberos._tcp      IN  SRV     01 00 88 kerberos.example.org.
 _kpasswd._udp       IN  SRV     01 00 464 kerberos.example.org.
 _kerberos-adm._tcp  IN  SRV     01 00 749 kerberos.example.org.
 _kerberos           IN  TXT     EXAMPLE.ORG.

   Next we will create the Kerberos database. This database contains the keys
   of all principals encrypted with a master password. You are not required
   to remember this password, it will be stored in a file
   (/var/heimdal/m-key). To create the master key, run kstash and enter a
   password.

   Once the master key has been created, you can initialize the database
   using the kadmin program with the -l option (standing for ``local''). This
   option instructs kadmin to modify the database files directly rather than
   going through the kadmind network service. This handles the
   chicken-and-egg problem of trying to connect to the database before it is
   created. Once you have the kadmin prompt, use the init command to create
   your realms initial database.

   Lastly, while still in kadmin, create your first principal using the add
   command. Stick to the defaults options for the principal for now, you can
   always change them later with the modify command. Note that you can use
   the ? command at any prompt to see the available options.

   A sample database creation session is shown below:

 # kstash
 Master key: xxxxxxxx
 Verifying password - Master key: xxxxxxxx

 # kadmin -l
 kadmin> init EXAMPLE.ORG
 Realm max ticket life [unlimited]:
 kadmin> add tillman
 Max ticket life [unlimited]:
 Max renewable life [unlimited]:
 Attributes []:
 Password: xxxxxxxx
 Verifying password - Password: xxxxxxxx

   Now it is time to start up the KDC services. Run /etc/rc.d/kerberos start
   and /etc/rc.d/kadmind start to bring up the services. Note that you won't
   have any kerberized daemons running at this point but you should be able
   to confirm the that the KDC is functioning by obtaining and listing a
   ticket for the principal (user) that you just created from the
   command-line of the KDC itself:

 % k5init tillman
 tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG's Password:

 % k5list
 Credentials cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_500
         Principal: tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG

   Issued           Expires          Principal
 Aug 27 15:37:58  Aug 28 01:37:58  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.ORG@EXAMPLE.ORG

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.3 Kerberos enabling a server with Heimdal services

   First, we need a copy of the Kerberos configuration file, /etc/krb5.conf.
   To do so, simply copy it over to the client computer from the KDC in a
   secure fashion (using network utilities, such as scp(1), or physically via
   a floppy disk).

   Next you need a /etc/krb5.keytab file. This is the major difference
   between a server providing Kerberos enabled daemons and a workstation --
   the server must have a keytab file. This file contains the servers host
   key, which allows it and the KDC to verify each others identity. It must
   be transmitted to the server in a secure fashion, as the security of the
   server can be broken if the key is made public. This explicitly means that
   transferring it via a clear text channel, such as FTP, is a very bad idea.

   Typically, you transfer to the keytab to the server using the kadmin
   program. This is handy because you also need to create the host principal
   (the KDC end of the krb5.keytab) using kadmin.

   Note that you must have already obtained a ticket and that this ticket
   must be allowed to use the kadmin interface in the kadmind.acl. See the
   section titled ``Remote administration'' in the Heimdal info pages (info
   heimdal) for details on designing access control lists. If you do not want
   to enable remote kadmin access, you can simply securely connect to the KDC
   (via local console, ssh(1) or Kerberos telnet(1)) and perform
   administration locally using kadmin -l.

   After installing the /etc/krb5.conf file, you can use kadmin from the
   Kerberos server. The add --random-key command will let you add the servers
   host principal, and the ext command will allow you to extract the servers
   host principal to its own keytab. For example:

 # kadmin
 kadmin> add --random-key host/myserver.example.org
 Max ticket life [unlimited]:
 Max renewable life [unlimited]:
 Attributes []:
 kadmin> ext host/myserver.example.org
 kadmin> exit

   Note that the ext command (short for ``extract'') stores the extracted key
   in /etc/krb5.keytab by default.

   If you do not have kadmind running on the KDC (possibly for security
   reasons) and thus do not have access to kadmin remotely, you can add the
   host principal (host/myserver.EXAMPLE.ORG) directly on the KDC and then
   extract it to a temporary file (to avoid over-writing the /etc/krb5.keytab
   on the KDC) using something like this:

 # kadmin
 kadmin> ext --keytab=/tmp/example.keytab host/myserver.example.org
 kadmin> exit

   You can then securely copy the keytab to the server computer (using scp or
   a floppy, for example). Be sure to specify a non-default keytab name to
   avoid over-writing the keytab on the KDC.

   At this point your server can communicate with the KDC (due to its
   krb5.conf file) and it can prove its own identity (due to the krb5.keytab
   file). It is now ready for you to enable some Kerberos services. For this
   example we will enable the telnet service by putting a line like this into
   your /etc/inetd.conf and then restarting the inetd(8) service with
   /etc/rc.d/inetd restart:

 telnet    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/telnetd  telnetd -a user

   The critical bit is that the -a (for authentication) type is set to user.
   Consult the telnetd(8) manual page for more details.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.4 Kerberos enabling a client with Heimdal

   Setting up a client computer is almost trivially easy. As far as Kerberos
   configuration goes, you only need the Kerberos configuration file, located
   at /etc/krb5.conf. Simply securely copy it over to the client computer
   from the KDC.

   Test your client computer by attempting to use kinit, klist, and kdestroy
   from the client to obtain, show, and then delete a ticket for the
   principal you created above. You should also be able to use Kerberos
   applications to connect to Kerberos enabled servers, though if that does
   not work and obtaining a ticket does the problem is likely with the server
   and not with the client or the KDC.

   When testing an application like telnet, try using a packet sniffer (such
   as tcpdump(1)) to confirm that your password is not sent in the clear. Try
   using telnet with the -x option, which encrypts the entire data stream
   (similar to ssh).

   The core Kerberos client applications (traditionally named kinit, klist,
   kdestroy, and kpasswd) are installed in the base DragonFly install. Note
   that DragonFly versions prior to 5.0 renamed them to k5init, k5list,
   k5destroy, k5passwd, and k5stash (though it is typically only used once).

   Various non-core Kerberos client applications are also installed by
   default. This is where the ``minimal'' nature of the base Heimdal
   installation is felt: telnet is the only Kerberos enabled service.

   The Heimdal port adds some of the missing client applications: Kerberos
   enabled versions of ftp, rsh, rcp, rlogin, and a few other less common
   programs. The MIT port also contains a full suite of Kerberos client
   applications.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.5 User configuration files: .k5login and .k5users

   Users within a realm typically have their Kerberos principal (such as
   tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG) mapped to a local user account (such as a local
   account named tillman). Client applications such as telnet usually do not
   require a user name or a principal.

   Occasionally, however, you want to grant access to a local user account to
   someone who does not have a matching Kerberos principal. For example,
   tillman@EXAMPLE.ORG may need access to the local user account
   webdevelopers. Other principals may also need access to that local
   account.

   The .k5login and .k5users files, placed in a users home directory, can be
   used similar to a powerful combination of .hosts and .rhosts, solving this
   problem. For example, if a .k5login with the following contents:

 tillman@example.org
 jdoe@example.org

   Were to be placed into the home directory of the local user webdevelopers
   then both principals listed would have access to that account without
   requiring a shared password.

   Reading the manual pages for these commands is recommended. Note that the
   ksu manual page covers .k5users.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.6 Kerberos Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting

     * When using either the Heimdal or MIT Kerberos ports ensure that your
       PATH environment variable lists the Kerberos versions of the client
       applications before the system versions.

     * Is your time in sync? Are you sure? If the time is not in sync
       (typically within five minutes) authentication will fail.

     * MIT and Heimdal inter-operate nicely. Except for kadmin, the protocol
       for which is not standardized.

     * If you change your hostname, you also need to change your host/
       principal and update your keytab. This also applies to special keytab
       entries like the www/ principal used for Apache's www/mod_auth_kerb.

     * All hosts in your realm must be resolvable (both forwards and reverse)
       in DNS (or /etc/hosts as a minimum). CNAMEs will work, but the A and
       PTR records must be correct and in place. The error message isn't very
       intuitive: ``Kerberos5 refuses authentication because Read req failed:
       Key table entry not found''.

     * Some operating systems that may being acting as clients to your KDC do
       not set the permissions for ksu to be setuid root. This means that ksu
       does not work, which is a good security idea but annoying. This is not
       a KDC error.

     * With MIT Kerberos, if you want to allow a principal to have a ticket
       life longer than the default ten hours, you must use modify_principal
       in kadmin to change the maxlife of both the principal in question and
       the krbtgt principal. Then the principal can use the -l option with
       kinit to request a ticket with a longer lifetime.

     * Note: If you run a packet sniffer on your KDC to add in
         troubleshooting and then run kinit from a workstation, you will
         notice that your TGT is sent immediately upon running kinit -- even
         before you type your password! The explanation is that the Kerberos
         server freely transmits a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) to any
         unauthorized request; however, every TGT is encrypted in a key
         derived from the user's password. Therefore, when a user types their
         password it is not being sent to the KDC, it is being used to
         decrypt the TGT that kinit already obtained. If the decryption
         process results in a valid ticket with a valid time stamp, the user
         has valid Kerberos credentials. These credentials include a session
         key for establishing secure communications with the Kerberos server
         in the future, as well as the actual ticket-granting ticket, which
         is actually encrypted with the Kerberos server's own key. This
         second layer of encryption is unknown to the user, but it is what
         allows the Kerberos server to verify the authenticity of each TGT.

     * You have to keep the time in sync between all the computers in your
       realm. NTP is perfect for this. For more information on NTP, see
       Section 19.12.

     * If you want to use long ticket lifetimes (a week, for example) and you
       are using OpenSSH to connect to the machine where your ticket is
       stored, make sure that Kerberos TicketCleanup is set to no in your
       sshd_config or else your tickets will be deleted when you log out.

     * Remember that host principals can have a longer ticket lifetime as
       well. If your user principal has a lifetime of a week but the host you
       are connecting to has a lifetime of nine hours, you will have an
       expired host principal in your cache and the ticket cache will not
       work as expected.

     * When setting up a krb5.dict file to prevent specific bad passwords
       from being used (the manual page for kadmind covers this briefly),
       remember that it only applies to principals that have a password
       policy assigned to them. The krb5.dict files format is simple: one
       string per line. Creating a symbolic link to /usr/share/dict/words
       might be useful.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.7 Differences with the MIT port

   The major difference between the MIT and Heimdal installs relates to the
   kadmin program which has a different (but equivalent) set of commands and
   uses a different protocol. This has a large implications if your KDC is
   MIT as you will not be able to use the Heimdal kadmin program to
   administer your KDC remotely (or vice versa, for that matter).

   The client applications may also take slightly different command line
   options to accomplish the same tasks. Following the instructions on the
   MIT Kerberos web site (http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/) is recommended.
   Be careful of path issues: the MIT port installs into /usr/local/ by
   default, and the ``normal'' system applications may be run instead of MIT
   if your PATH environment variable lists the system directories first.

     Note: With the MIT security/krb5 port that is provided by DragonFly, be
     sure to read the /usr/local/share/doc/krb5/README.FreeBSD file installed
     by the port if you want to understand why logins via telnetd and klogind
     behave somewhat oddly. Most importantly, correcting the ``incorrect
     permissions on cache file'' behavior requires that the login.krb5 binary
     be used for authentication so that it can properly change ownership for
     the forwarded credentials.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.6.8 Mitigating limitations found in Kerberos

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.6.8.1 Kerberos is an all-or-nothing approach

   Every service enabled on the network must be modified to work with
   Kerberos (or be otherwise secured against network attacks) or else the
   users credentials could be stolen and re-used. An example of this would be
   Kerberos enabling all remote shells (via rsh and telnet, for example) but
   not converting the POP3 mail server which sends passwords in plaintext.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.6.8.2 Kerberos is intended for single-user workstations

   In a multi-user environment, Kerberos is less secure. This is because it
   stores the tickets in the /tmp directory, which is readable by all users.
   If a user is sharing a computer with several other people simultaneously
   (i.e. multi-user), it is possible that the user's tickets can be stolen
   (copied) by another user.

   This can be overcome with the -c filename command-line option or
   (preferably) the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, but this is rarely done.
   In principal, storing the ticket in the users home directory and using
   simple file permissions can mitigate this problem.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.6.8.3 The KDC is a single point of failure

   By design, the KDC must be as secure as the master password database is
   contained on it. The KDC should have absolutely no other services running
   on it and should be physically secured. The danger is high because
   Kerberos stores all passwords encrypted with the same key (the ``master''
   key), which in turn is stored as a file on the KDC.

   As a side note, a compromised master key is not quite as bad as one might
   normally fear. The master key is only used to encrypt the Kerberos
   database and as a seed for the random number generator. As long as access
   to your KDC is secure, an attacker cannot do much with the master key.

   Additionally, if the KDC is unavailable (perhaps due to a denial of
   service attack or network problems) the network services are unusable as
   authentication can not be performed, a recipe for a denial-of-service
   attack. This can alleviated with multiple KDCs (a single master and one or
   more slaves) and with careful implementation of secondary or fall-back
   authentication (PAM is excellent for this).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.6.8.4 Kerberos Shortcomings

   Kerberos allows users, hosts and services to authenticate between
   themselves. It does not have a mechanism to authenticate the KDC to the
   users, hosts or services. This means that a trojanned kinit (for example)
   could record all user names and passwords. Something like
   security/tripwire or other file system integrity checking tools can
   alleviate this.

10.7 Firewalls

   Contributed by Gary Palmer and Alex Nash.

   Firewalls are an area of increasing interest for people who are connected
   to the Internet, and are even finding applications on private networks to
   provide enhanced security. This section will hopefully explain what
   firewalls are, how to use them, and how to use the facilities provided in
   the DragonFly kernel to implement them.

     Note: People often think that having a firewall between your internal
     network and the ``Big Bad Internet'' will solve all your security
     problems. It may help, but a poorly set up firewall system is more of a
     security risk than not having one at all. A firewall can add another
     layer of security to your systems, but it cannot stop a really
     determined cracker from penetrating your internal network. If you let
     internal security lapse because you believe your firewall to be
     impenetrable, you have just made the crackers job that much easier.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.1 What Is a Firewall?

   There are currently two distinct types of firewalls in common use on the
   Internet today. The first type is more properly called a packet filtering
   router. This type of firewall utilizes a multi-homed machine and a set of
   rules to determine whether to forward or block individual packets. A
   multi-homed machine is simply a device with multiple network interfaces.
   The second type, known as a proxy server, relies on daemons to provide
   authentication and to forward packets, possibly on a multi-homed machine
   which has kernel packet forwarding disabled.

   Sometimes sites combine the two types of firewalls, so that only a certain
   machine (known as a bastion host) is allowed to send packets through a
   packet filtering router onto an internal network. Proxy services are run
   on the bastion host, which are generally more secure than normal
   authentication mechanisms.

   DragonFly comes with a kernel packet filter (known as IPFW), which is what
   the rest of this section will concentrate on. Proxy servers can be built
   on DragonFly from third party software, but there is such a variety of
   proxy servers available that it would be impossible to cover them in this
   section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.1.1 Packet Filtering Routers

   A router is a machine which forwards packets between two or more networks.
   A packet filtering router is programmed to compare each packet to a list
   of rules before deciding if it should be forwarded or not. Most modern IP
   routing software includes packet filtering functionality that defaults to
   forwarding all packets. To enable the filters, you need to define a set of
   rules.

   To decide whether a packet should be passed on, the firewall looks through
   its set of rules for a rule which matches the contents of the packet's
   headers. Once a match is found, the rule action is obeyed. The rule action
   could be to drop the packet, to forward the packet, or even to send an
   ICMP message back to the originator. Only the first match counts, as the
   rules are searched in order. Hence, the list of rules can be referred to
   as a ``rule chain''.

   The packet-matching criteria varies depending on the software used, but
   typically you can specify rules which depend on the source IP address of
   the packet, the destination IP address, the source port number, the
   destination port number (for protocols which support ports), or even the
   packet type (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.1.2 Proxy Servers

   Proxy servers are machines which have had the normal system daemons
   (telnetd, ftpd, etc) replaced with special servers. These servers are
   called proxy servers, as they normally only allow onward connections to be
   made. This enables you to run (for example) a proxy telnet server on your
   firewall host, and people can telnet in to your firewall from the outside,
   go through some authentication mechanism, and then gain access to the
   internal network (alternatively, proxy servers can be used for signals
   coming from the internal network and heading out).

   Proxy servers are normally more secure than normal servers, and often have
   a wider variety of authentication mechanisms available, including
   ``one-shot'' password systems so that even if someone manages to discover
   what password you used, they will not be able to use it to gain access to
   your systems as the password expires immediately after the first use. As
   they do not actually give users access to the host machine, it becomes a
   lot more difficult for someone to install backdoors around your security
   system.

   Proxy servers often have ways of restricting access further, so that only
   certain hosts can gain access to the servers. Most will also allow the
   administrator to specify which users can talk to which destination
   machines. Again, what facilities are available depends largely on what
   proxy software you choose.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.2 What Does IPFW Allow Me to Do?

   IPFW, the software supplied with DragonFly, is a packet filtering and
   accounting system which resides in the kernel, and has a user-land control
   utility, ipfw(8). Together, they allow you to define and query the rules
   used by the kernel in its routing decisions.

   There are two related parts to IPFW. The firewall section performs packet
   filtering. There is also an IP accounting section which tracks usage of
   the router, based on rules similar to those used in the firewall section.
   This allows the administrator to monitor how much traffic the router is
   getting from a certain machine, or how much WWW traffic it is forwarding,
   for example.

   As a result of the way that IPFW is designed, you can use IPFW on
   non-router machines to perform packet filtering on incoming and outgoing
   connections. This is a special case of the more general use of IPFW, and
   the same commands and techniques should be used in this situation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.3 Enabling IPFW on DragonFly

   As the main part of the IPFW system lives in the kernel, you will need to
   add one or more options to your kernel configuration file, depending on
   what facilities you want, and recompile your kernel. See "Reconfiguring
   your Kernel" (Chapter 9) for more details on how to recompile your kernel.

     Warning: IPFW defaults to a policy of deny ip from any to any. If you do
     not add other rules during startup to allow access, you will lock
     yourself out of the server upon rebooting into a firewall-enabled
     kernel. We suggest that you set firewall_type=open in your /etc/rc.conf
     file when first enabling this feature, then refining the firewall rules
     in /etc/rc.firewall after you have tested that the new kernel feature
     works properly. To be on the safe side, you may wish to consider
     performing the initial firewall configuration from the local console
     rather than via ssh. Another option is to build a kernel using both the
     IPFIREWALL and IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT options. This will change
     the default rule of IPFW to allow ip from any to any and avoid the
     possibility of a lockout.

   There are currently four kernel configuration options relevant to IPFW:

   options IPFIREWALL

           Compiles into the kernel the code for packet filtering.

   options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE

           Enables code to allow logging of packets through syslogd(8).
           Without this option, even if you specify that packets should be
           logged in the filter rules, nothing will happen.

   options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=10

           Limits the number of packets logged through syslogd(8) on a per
           entry basis. You may wish to use this option in hostile
           environments in which you want to log firewall activity, but do
           not want to be open to a denial of service attack via syslog
           flooding.

           When a chain entry reaches the packet limit specified, logging is
           turned off for that particular entry. To resume logging, you will
           need to reset the associated counter using the ipfw(8) utility:

 # ipfw zero 4500

           Where 4500 is the chain entry you wish to continue logging.

   options IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT

           This changes the default rule action from ``deny'' to ``allow''.
           This avoids the possibility of locking yourself out if you happen
           to boot a kernel with IPFIREWALL support but have not configured
           your firewall yet. It is also very useful if you often use ipfw(8)
           as a filter for specific problems as they arise. Use with care
           though, as this opens up the firewall and changes the way it
           works.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.4 Configuring IPFW

   The configuration of the IPFW software is done through the ipfw(8)
   utility. The syntax for this command looks quite complicated, but it is
   relatively simple once you understand its structure.

   There are currently four different command categories used by the utility:
   addition/deletion, listing, flushing, and clearing. Addition/deletion is
   used to build the rules that control how packets are accepted, rejected,
   and logged. Listing is used to examine the contents of your rule set
   (otherwise known as the chain) and packet counters (accounting). Flushing
   is used to remove all entries from the chain. Clearing is used to zero out
   one or more accounting entries.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.4.1 Altering the IPFW Rules

   The syntax for this form of the command is:

   ipfw [-N] command [index] action [log] protocol addresses [options]

   There is one valid flag when using this form of the command:

   -N

           Resolve addresses and service names in output.

   The command given can be shortened to the shortest unique form. The valid
   commands are:

   add

           Add an entry to the firewall/accounting rule list

   delete

           Delete an entry from the firewall/accounting rule list

   Previous versions of IPFW used separate firewall and accounting entries.
   The present version provides packet accounting with each firewall entry.

   If an index value is supplied, it is used to place the entry at a specific
   point in the chain. Otherwise, the entry is placed at the end of the chain
   at an index 100 greater than the last chain entry (this does not include
   the default policy, rule 65535, deny).

   The log option causes matching rules to be output to the system console if
   the kernel was compiled with IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE.

   Valid actions are:

   reject

           Drop the packet, and send an ICMP host or port unreachable (as
           appropriate) packet to the source.

   allow

           Pass the packet on as normal. (aliases: pass, permit, and accept)

   deny

           Drop the packet. The source is not notified via an ICMP message
           (thus it appears that the packet never arrived at the
           destination).

   count

           Update packet counters but do not allow/deny the packet based on
           this rule. The search continues with the next chain entry.

   Each action will be recognized by the shortest unambiguous prefix.

   The protocols which can be specified are:

   all

           Matches any IP packet

   icmp

           Matches ICMP packets

   tcp

           Matches TCP packets

   udp

           Matches UDP packets

   The address specification is:

   from address/mask [port] to address/mask [port] [via interface]

   You can only specify port in conjunction with protocols which support
   ports (UDP and TCP).

   The via is optional and may specify the IP address or domain name of a
   local IP interface, or an interface name (e.g. ed0) to match only packets
   coming through this interface. Interface unit numbers can be specified
   with an optional wildcard. For example, ppp* would match all kernel PPP
   interfaces.

   The syntax used to specify an address/mask is:

 address

   or

 address/mask-bits

   or

 address:mask-pattern

   A valid hostname may be specified in place of the IP address. mask-bits is
   a decimal number representing how many bits in the address mask should be
   set. e.g. specifying 192.216.222.1/24 will create a mask which will allow
   any address in a class C subnet (in this case, 192.216.222) to be matched.
   mask-pattern is an IP address which will be logically AND'ed with the
   address given. The keyword any may be used to specify ``any IP address''.

   The port numbers to be blocked are specified as:

   port [,port [,port [...]]]

   to specify either a single port or a list of ports, or

   port-port

   to specify a range of ports. You may also combine a single range with a
   list, but the range must always be specified first.

   The options available are:

   frag

           Matches if the packet is not the first fragment of the datagram.

   in

           Matches if the packet is on the way in.

   out

           Matches if the packet is on the way out.

   ipoptions spec

           Matches if the IP header contains the comma separated list of
           options specified in spec. The supported IP options are: ssrr
           (strict source route), lsrr (loose source route), rr (record
           packet route), and ts (time stamp). The absence of a particular
           option may be specified with a leading !.

   established

           Matches if the packet is part of an already established TCP
           connection (i.e. it has the RST or ACK bits set). You can optimize
           the performance of the firewall by placing established rules early
           in the chain.

   setup

           Matches if the packet is an attempt to establish a TCP connection
           (the SYN bit is set but the ACK bit is not).

   tcpflags flags

           Matches if the TCP header contains the comma separated list of
           flags. The supported flags are fin, syn, rst, psh, ack, and urg.
           The absence of a particular flag may be indicated by a leading !.

   icmptypes types

           Matches if the ICMP type is present in the list types. The list
           may be specified as any combination of ranges and/or individual
           types separated by commas. Commonly used ICMP types are: 0 echo
           reply (ping reply), 3 destination unreachable, 5 redirect, 8 echo
           request (ping request), and 11 time exceeded (used to indicate TTL
           expiration as with traceroute(8)).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.4.2 Listing the IPFW Rules

   The syntax for this form of the command is:

   ipfw [-a] [-c] [-d] [-e] [-t] [-N] [-S] list

   There are seven valid flags when using this form of the command:

   -a

           While listing, show counter values. This option is the only way to
           see accounting counters.

   -c

           List rules in compact form.

   -d

           Show dynamic rules in addition to static rules.

   -e

           If -d was specified, also show expired dynamic rules.

   -t

           Display the last match times for each chain entry. The time
           listing is incompatible with the input syntax used by the ipfw(8)
           utility.

   -N

           Attempt to resolve given addresses and service names.

   -S

           Show the set each rule belongs to. If this flag is not specified,
           disabled rules will not be listed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.4.3 Flushing the IPFW Rules

   The syntax for flushing the chain is:

   ipfw flush

   This causes all entries in the firewall chain to be removed except the
   fixed default policy enforced by the kernel (index 65535). Use caution
   when flushing rules; the default deny policy will leave your system cut
   off from the network until allow entries are added to the chain.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.7.4.4 Clearing the IPFW Packet Counters

   The syntax for clearing one or more packet counters is:

   ipfw zero [index]

   When used without an index argument, all packet counters are cleared. If
   an index is supplied, the clearing operation only affects a specific chain
   entry.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.5 Example Commands for ipfw

   This command will deny all packets from the host evil.crackers.org to the
   telnet port of the host nice.people.org:

 # ipfw add deny tcp from evil.crackers.org to nice.people.org 23

   The next example denies and logs any TCP traffic from the entire
   crackers.org network (a class C) to the nice.people.org machine (any
   port).

 # ipfw add deny log tcp from evil.crackers.org/24 to nice.people.org

   If you do not want people sending X sessions to your internal network (a
   subnet of a class C), the following command will do the necessary
   filtering:

 # ipfw add deny tcp from any to my.org/28 6000 setup

   To see the accounting records:

 # ipfw -a list

   or in the short form

 # ipfw -a l

   You can also see the last time a chain entry was matched with:

 # ipfw -at l

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.6 Building a Packet Filtering Firewall

     Note: The following suggestions are just that: suggestions. The
     requirements of each firewall are different and we cannot tell you how
     to build a firewall to meet your particular requirements.

   When initially setting up your firewall, unless you have a test bench
   setup where you can configure your firewall host in a controlled
   environment, it is strongly recommend you use the logging version of the
   commands and enable logging in the kernel. This will allow you to quickly
   identify problem areas and cure them without too much disruption. Even
   after the initial setup phase is complete, I recommend using the logging
   for `deny' as it allows tracing of possible attacks and also modification
   of the firewall rules if your requirements alter.

     Note: If you use the logging versions of the accept command, be aware
     that it can generate large amounts of log data. One log entry will be
     generated for every packet that passes through the firewall, so large
     FTP/http transfers, etc, will really slow the system down. It also
     increases the latencies on those packets as it requires more work to be
     done by the kernel before the packet can be passed on. syslogd will also
     start using up a lot more processor time as it logs all the extra data
     to disk, and it could quite easily fill the partition /var/log is
     located on.

   You should enable your firewall from /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.
   The associated manual page explains which knobs to fiddle and lists some
   preset firewall configurations. If you do not use a preset configuration,
   ipfw list will output the current ruleset into a file that you can pass to
   rc.conf. If you do not use /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf to enable
   your firewall, it is important to make sure your firewall is enabled
   before any IP interfaces are configured.

   The next problem is what your firewall should actually do! This is largely
   dependent on what access to your network you want to allow from the
   outside, and how much access to the outside world you want to allow from
   the inside. Some general rules are:

     * Block all incoming access to ports below 1024 for TCP. This is where
       most of the security sensitive services are, like finger, SMTP (mail)
       and telnet.

     * Block all incoming UDP traffic. There are very few useful services
       that travel over UDP, and what useful traffic there is, is normally a
       security threat (e.g. Suns RPC and NFS protocols). This has its
       disadvantages also, since UDP is a connectionless protocol, denying
       incoming UDP traffic also blocks the replies to outgoing UDP traffic.
       This can cause a problem for people (on the inside) using external
       archie (prospero) servers. If you want to allow access to archie, you
       will have to allow packets coming from ports 191 and 1525 to any
       internal UDP port through the firewall. ntp is another service you may
       consider allowing through, which comes from port 123.

     * Block traffic to port 6000 from the outside. Port 6000 is the port
       used for access to X11 servers, and can be a security threat
       (especially if people are in the habit of doing xhost + on their
       workstations). X11 can actually use a range of ports starting at 6000,
       the upper limit being how many X displays you can run on the machine.
       The upper limit as defined by RFC 1700 (Assigned Numbers) is 6063.

     * Check what ports any internal servers use (e.g. SQL servers, etc). It
       is probably a good idea to block those as well, as they normally fall
       outside the 1-1024 range specified above.

   Another checklist for firewall configuration is available from CERT at
   http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/packet_filtering.html

   As stated above, these are only guidelines. You will have to decide what
   filter rules you want to use on your firewall yourself. We cannot accept
   ANY responsibility if someone breaks into your network, even if you follow
   the advice given above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.7.7 IPFW Overhead and Optimization

   Many people want to know how much overhead IPFW adds to a system. The
   answer to this depends mostly on your rule set and processor speed. For
   most applications dealing with Ethernet and small rule sets, the answer is
   ``negligible''. For those of you that need actual measurements to satisfy
   your curiosity, read on.

   The following measurements were made using FreeBSD 2.2.5-STABLE on a
   486-66. (While IPFW has changed slightly in later releases of DragonFly,
   it still performs with similar speed.) IPFW was modified to measure the
   time spent within the ip_fw_chk routine, displaying the results to the
   console every 1000 packets.

   Two rule sets, each with 1000 rules, were tested. The first set was
   designed to demonstrate a worst case scenario by repeating the rule:

 # ipfw add deny tcp from any to any 55555

   This demonstrates a worst case scenario by causing most of IPFW's packet
   check routine to be executed before finally deciding that the packet does
   not match the rule (by virtue of the port number). Following the 999th
   iteration of this rule was an allow ip from any to any.

   The second set of rules were designed to abort the rule check quickly:

 # ipfw add deny ip from 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.4

   The non-matching source IP address for the above rule causes these rules
   to be skipped very quickly. As before, the 1000th rule was an allow ip
   from any to any.

   The per-packet processing overhead in the former case was approximately
   2.703 ms/packet, or roughly 2.7 microseconds per rule. Thus the
   theoretical packet processing limit with these rules is around 370 packets
   per second. Assuming 10 Mbps Ethernet and a ~1500 byte packet size, we
   would only be able to achieve 55.5% bandwidth utilization.

   For the latter case each packet was processed in approximately 1.172 ms,
   or roughly 1.2 microseconds per rule. The theoretical packet processing
   limit here would be about 853 packets per second, which could consume
   10 Mbps Ethernet bandwidth.

   The excessive number of rules tested and the nature of those rules do not
   provide a real-world scenario -- they were used only to generate the
   timing information presented here. Here are a few things to keep in mind
   when building an efficient rule set:

     * Place an established rule early on to handle the majority of TCP
       traffic. Do not put any allow tcp statements before this rule.

     * Place heavily triggered rules earlier in the rule set than those
       rarely used (without changing the permissiveness of the firewall, of
       course). You can see which rules are used most often by examining the
       packet counting statistics with ipfw -a l.

10.8 OpenSSL

   OpenSSL provides a general-purpose cryptography library, as well as the
   Secure Sockets Layer v2/v3 (SSLv2/SSLv3) and Transport Layer Security v1
   (TLSv1) network security protocols.

   However, one of the algorithms (specifically IDEA) included in OpenSSL is
   protected by patents in the USA and elsewhere, and is not available for
   unrestricted use. IDEA is included in the OpenSSL sources in DragonFly,
   but it is not built by default. If you wish to use it, and you comply with
   the license terms, enable the MAKE_IDEA switch in /etc/make.conf and
   rebuild your sources using make world.

   Today, the RSA algorithm is free for use in USA and other countries. In
   the past it was protected by a patent.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.8.1 Source Code Installations

   OpenSSL is part of the src-crypto and src-secure CVSup collections. See
   the Obtaining DragonFly section for more information about obtaining and
   updating DragonFly source code.

10.9 VPN over IPsec

   Written by Nik Clayton.

   Creating a VPN between two networks, separated by the Internet, using
   DragonFly gateways.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.9.1 Understanding IPsec

   Written by Hiten M. Pandya.

   This section will guide you through the process of setting up IPsec, and
   to use it in an environment which consists of DragonFly and
   Microsoft Windows 2000/XP machines, to make them communicate securely. In
   order to set up IPsec, it is necessary that you are familiar with the
   concepts of building a custom kernel (see Chapter 9).

   IPsec is a protocol which sits on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.
   It allows two or more hosts to communicate in a secure manner (hence the
   name). The DragonFly IPsec ``network stack'' is based on the KAME
   implementation, which has support for both protocol families, IPv4 and
   IPv6.

   IPsec consists of two sub-protocols:

     * Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), protects the IP packet data from
       third party interference, by encrypting the contents using symmetric
       cryptography algorithms (like Blowfish, 3DES).

     * Authentication Header (AH), protects the IP packet header from third
       party interference and spoofing, by computing a cryptographic checksum
       and hashing the IP packet header fields with a secure hashing
       function. This is then followed by an additional header that contains
       the hash, to allow the information in the packet to be authenticated.

   ESP and AH can either be used together or separately, depending on the
   environment.

   IPsec can either be used to directly encrypt the traffic between two hosts
   (known as Transport Mode); or to build ``virtual tunnels'' between two
   subnets, which could be used for secure communication between two
   corporate networks (known as Tunnel Mode). The latter is more commonly
   known as a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The ipsec(4) manual page should
   be consulted for detailed information on the IPsec subsystem in DragonFly.

   To add IPsec support to your kernel, add the following options to your
   kernel configuration file:

 options   IPSEC        #IP security
 options   IPSEC_ESP    #IP security (crypto; define w/ IPSEC)
      

   If IPsec debugging support is desired, the following kernel option should
   also be added:

 options   IPSEC_DEBUG  #debug for IP security
      

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.9.2 The Problem

   There's no standard for what constitutes a VPN. VPNs can be implemented
   using a number of different technologies, each of which have their own
   strengths and weaknesses. This article presents a number of scenarios, and
   strategies for implementing a VPN for each scenario.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.9.3 Scenario #1: Two networks, connected to the Internet, to behave as one

   This is the scenario that caused me to first investigating VPNs. The
   premise is as follows:

     * You have at least two sites

     * Both sites are using IP internally

     * Both sites are connected to the Internet, through a gateway that is
       running DragonFly.

     * The gateway on each network has at least one public IP address.

     * The internal addresses of the two networks can be public or private IP
       addresses, it doesn't matter. You can be running NAT on the gateway
       machine if necessary.

     * The internal IP addresses of the two networks do not collide. While I
       expect it is theoretically possible to use a combination of VPN
       technology and NAT to get this to work, I expect it to be a
       configuration nightmare.

   If you find that you are trying to connect two networks, both of which,
   internally, use the same private IP address range (e.g., both of them use
   192.168.1.x), then one of the networks will have to be renumbered.

   The network topology might look something like this:

 Network #1            [ Internal Hosts ]    Private Net, 192.168.1.2-254
                       [   Win9x/NT/2K  ]
                       [      UNIX      ]
                                |
                                |
                         .---[fxp1]---.      Private IP, 192.168.1.1
                               DragonFly 
                         `---[fxp0]---'      Public IP, A.B.C.D
                                |
                                |
                       -=-=- Internet -=-=-
                                |
                                |
                         .---[fxp0]---.      Public IP, W.X.Y.Z
                               DragonFly 
                         `---[fxp1]---'      Private IP, 192.168.2.1
                                |
                                |
 Network #2            [ Internal Hosts ]
                       [   Win9x/NT/2K  ]    Private Net, 192.168.2.2-254
                       [      UNIX      ]

   Notice the two public IP addresses. I'll use the letters to refer to them
   in the rest of this article. Anywhere you see those letters in this
   article, replace them with your own public IP addresses. Note also that
   internally, the two gateway machines have .1 IP addresses, and that the
   two networks have different private IP addresses (192.168.1.x and
   192.168.2.x respectively). All the machines on the private networks have
   been configured to use the .1 machine as their default gateway.

   The intention is that, from a network point of view, each network should
   view the machines on the other network as though they were directly
   attached the same router -- albeit a slightly slow router with an
   occasional tendency to drop packets.

   This means that (for example), machine 192.168.1.20 should be able to run

 ping 192.168.2.34

   and have it work, transparently. Windows machines should be able to see
   the machines on the other network, browse file shares, and so on, in
   exactly the same way that they can browse machines on the local network.

   And the whole thing has to be secure. This means that traffic between the
   two networks has to be encrypted.

   Creating a VPN between these two networks is a multi-step process. The
   stages are as follows:

    1. Create a ``virtual'' network link between the two networks, across the
       Internet. Test it, using tools like ping(8), to make sure it works.

    2. Apply security policies to ensure that traffic between the two
       networks is transparently encrypted and decrypted as necessary. Test
       this, using tools like tcpdump(1), to ensure that traffic is
       encrypted.

    3. Configure additional software on the DragonFly gateways, to allow
       Windows machines to see one another across the VPN.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.9.3.1 Step 1: Creating and testing a ``virtual'' network link

   Suppose that you were logged in to the gateway machine on network #1 (with
   public IP address A.B.C.D, private IP address 192.168.1.1), and you ran
   ping 192.168.2.1, which is the private address of the machine with IP
   address W.X.Y.Z. What needs to happen in order for this to work?

    1. The gateway machine needs to know how to reach 192.168.2.1. In other
       words, it needs to have a route to 192.168.2.1.

    2. Private IP addresses, such as those in the 192.168.x range are not
       supposed to appear on the Internet at large. Instead, each packet you
       send to 192.168.2.1 will need to be wrapped up inside another packet.
       This packet will need to appear to be from A.B.C.D, and it will have
       to be sent to W.X.Y.Z. This process is called encapsulation.

    3. Once this packet arrives at W.X.Y.Z it will need to
       ``unencapsulated'', and delivered to 192.168.2.1.

   You can think of this as requiring a ``tunnel'' between the two networks.
   The two ``tunnel mouths'' are the IP addresses A.B.C.D and W.X.Y.Z, and
   the tunnel must be told the addresses of the private IP addresses that
   will be allowed to pass through it. The tunnel is used to transfer traffic
   with private IP addresses across the public Internet.

   This tunnel is created by using the generic interface, or gif devices on
   DragonFly. As you can imagine, the gif interface on each gateway host must
   be configured with four IP addresses; two for the public IP addresses, and
   two for the private IP addresses.

   Support for the gif device must be compiled in to the DragonFly kernel on
   both machines. You can do this by adding the line:

 pseudo-device gif

   to the kernel configuration files on both machines, and then compile,
   install, and reboot as normal.

   Configuring the tunnel is a two step process. First the tunnel must be
   told what the outside (or public) IP addresses are, using gifconfig(8).
   Then the private IP addresses must be configured using ifconfig(8).

   On the gateway machine on network #1 you would run the following two
   commands to configure the tunnel.

 gifconfig gif0 A.B.C.D W.X.Y.Z
 ifconfig gif0 inet 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffffff
      

   On the other gateway machine you run the same commands, but with the order
   of the IP addresses reversed.

 gifconfig gif0 W.X.Y.Z A.B.C.D
 ifconfig gif0 inet 192.168.2.1 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffffff
      

   You can then run:

 gifconfig gif0

   to see the configuration. For example, on the network #1 gateway, you
   would see this:

 # gifconfig gif0
 gif0: flags=8011<UP,POINTTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280
 inet 192.168.1.1 --> 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffffff
 physical address inet A.B.C.D --> W.X.Y.Z
      

   As you can see, a tunnel has been created between the physical addresses
   A.B.C.D and W.X.Y.Z, and the traffic allowed through the tunnel is that
   between 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1.

   This will also have added an entry to the routing table on both machines,
   which you can examine with the command netstat -rn. This output is from
   the gateway host on network #1.

 # netstat -rn
 Routing tables
 
 Internet:
 Destination      Gateway       Flags    Refs    Use    Netif  Expire
 ...
 192.168.2.1      192.168.1.1   UH        0        0    gif0
 ...
      

   As the ``Flags'' value indicates, this is a host route, which means that
   each gateway knows how to reach the other gateway, but they do not know
   how to reach the rest of their respective networks. That problem will be
   fixed shortly.

   It is likely that you are running a firewall on both machines. This will
   need to be circumvented for your VPN traffic. You might want to allow all
   traffic between both networks, or you might want to include firewall rules
   that protect both ends of the VPN from one another.

   It greatly simplifies testing if you configure the firewall to allow all
   traffic through the VPN. You can always tighten things up later. If you
   are using ipfw(8) on the gateway machines then a command like

 ipfw add 1 allow ip from any to any via gif0

   will allow all traffic between the two end points of the VPN, without
   affecting your other firewall rules. Obviously you will need to run this
   command on both gateway hosts.

   This is sufficient to allow each gateway machine to ping the other. On
   192.168.1.1, you should be able to run

 ping 192.168.2.1

   and get a response, and you should be able to do the same thing on the
   other gateway machine.

   However, you will not be able to reach internal machines on either network
   yet. This is because of the routing -- although the gateway machines know
   how to reach one another, they do not know how to reach the network behind
   each one.

   To solve this problem you must add a static route on each gateway machine.
   The command to do this on the first gateway would be:

 route add 192.168.2.0 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00
      

   This says ``In order to reach the hosts on the network 192.168.2.0, send
   the packets to the host 192.168.2.1''. You will need to run a similar
   command on the other gateway, but with the 192.168.1.x addresses instead.

   IP traffic from hosts on one network will now be able to reach hosts on
   the other network.

   That has now created two thirds of a VPN between the two networks, in as
   much as it is ``virtual'' and it is a ``network''. It is not private yet.
   You can test this using ping(8) and tcpdump(1). Log in to the gateway host
   and run

 tcpdump dst host 192.168.2.1

   In another log in session on the same host run

 ping 192.168.2.1

   You will see output that looks something like this:

 16:10:24.018080 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo request
 16:10:24.018109 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo reply
 16:10:25.018814 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo request
 16:10:25.018847 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo reply
 16:10:26.028896 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo request
 16:10:26.029112 192.168.1.1 > 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo reply
      

   As you can see, the ICMP messages are going back and forth unencrypted. If
   you had used the -s parameter to tcpdump(1) to grab more bytes of data
   from the packets you would see more information.

   Obviously this is unacceptable. The next section will discuss securing the
   link between the two networks so that it all traffic is automatically
   encrypted.

   Summary:

     * Configure both kernels with ``pseudo-device gif''.

     * Edit /etc/rc.conf on gateway host #1 and add the following lines
       (replacing IP addresses as necessary).

 gifconfig_gif0="A.B.C.D W.X.Y.Z"
 ifconfig_gif0="inet 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffffff"
 static_routes="vpn"
 route_vpn="192.168.2.0 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00"
          

     * Edit your firewall script (/etc/rc.firewall, or similar) on both
       hosts, and add

 ipfw add 1 allow ip from any to any via gif0

     * Make similar changes to /etc/rc.conf on gateway host #2, reversing the
       order of IP addresses.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.9.3.2 Step 2: Securing the link

   To secure the link we will be using IPsec. IPsec provides a mechanism for
   two hosts to agree on an encryption key, and to then use this key in order
   to encrypt data between the two hosts.

   The are two areas of configuration to be considered here.

    1. There must be a mechanism for two hosts to agree on the encryption
       mechanism to use. Once two hosts have agreed on this mechanism there
       is said to be a ``security association'' between them.

    2. There must be a mechanism for specifying which traffic should be
       encrypted. Obviously, you don't want to encrypt all your outgoing
       traffic -- you only want to encrypt the traffic that is part of the
       VPN. The rules that you put in place to determine what traffic will be
       encrypted are called ``security policies''.

   Security associations and security policies are both maintained by the
   kernel, and can be modified by userland programs. However, before you can
   do this you must configure the kernel to support IPsec and the
   Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) protocol. This is done by configuring
   a kernel with:

 options IPSEC
 options IPSEC_ESP
       

   and recompiling, reinstalling, and rebooting. As before you will need to
   do this to the kernels on both of the gateway hosts.

   You have two choices when it comes to setting up security associations.
   You can configure them by hand between two hosts, which entails choosing
   the encryption algorithm, encryption keys, and so forth, or you can use
   daemons that implement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to do this
   for you.

   I recommend the latter. Apart from anything else, it is easier to set up.

   Editing and displaying security policies is carried out using setkey(8).
   By analogy, setkey is to the kernel's security policy tables as route(8)
   is to the kernel's routing tables. setkey can also display the current
   security associations, and to continue the analogy further, is akin to
   netstat -r in that respect.

   There are a number of choices for daemons to manage security associations
   with DragonFly. This article will describe how to use one of these,
   racoon. racoon is in the FreeBSD ports collection, in the security/
   category, and is installed in the usual way.

   racoon must be run on both gateway hosts. On each host it is configured
   with the IP address of the other end of the VPN, and a secret key (which
   you choose, and must be the same on both gateways).

   The two daemons then contact one another, confirm that they are who they
   say they are (by using the secret key that you configured). The daemons
   then generate a new secret key, and use this to encrypt the traffic over
   the VPN. They periodically change this secret, so that even if an attacker
   were to crack one of the keys (which is as theoretically close to
   unfeasible as it gets) it won't do them much good -- by the time they've
   cracked the key the two daemons have chosen another one.

   racoon's configuration is stored in ${PREFIX}/etc/racoon. You should find
   a configuration file there, which should not need to be changed too much.
   The other component of racoon's configuration, which you will need to
   change, is the ``pre-shared key''.

   The default racoon configuration expects to find this in the file
   ${PREFIX}/etc/racoon/psk.txt. It is important to note that the pre-shared
   key is not the key that will be used to encrypt your traffic across the
   VPN link, it is simply a token that allows the key management daemons to
   trust one another.

   psk.txt contains a line for each remote site you are dealing with. In this
   example, where there are two sites, each psk.txt file will contain one
   line (because each end of the VPN is only dealing with one other end).

   On gateway host #1 this line should look like this:

 W.X.Y.Z            secret

   That is, the public IP address of the remote end, whitespace, and a text
   string that provides the secret. Obviously, you shouldn't use ``secret''
   as your key -- the normal rules for choosing a password apply.

   On gateway host #2 the line would look like this

 A.B.C.D            secret

   That is, the public IP address of the remote end, and the same secret key.
   psk.txt must be mode 0600 (i.e., only read/write to root) before racoon
   will run.

   You must run racoon on both gateway machines. You will also need to add
   some firewall rules to allow the IKE traffic, which is carried over UDP to
   the ISAKMP (Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol) port.
   Again, this should be fairly early in your firewall ruleset.

 ipfw add 1 allow udp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z isakmp
 ipfw add 1 allow udp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D isakmp
       

   Once racoon is running you can try pinging one gateway host from the
   other. The connection is still not encrypted, but racoon will then set up
   the security associations between the two hosts -- this might take a
   moment, and you may see this as a short delay before the ping commands
   start responding.

   Once the security association has been set up you can view it using
   setkey(8). Run

 setkey -D

   on either host to view the security association information.

   That's one half of the problem. They other half is setting your security
   policies.

   To create a sensible security policy, let's review what's been set up so
   far. This discussions hold for both ends of the link.

   Each IP packet that you send out has a header that contains data about the
   packet. The header includes the IP addresses of both the source and
   destination. As we already know, private IP addresses, such as the
   192.168.x.y range are not supposed to appear on the public Internet.
   Instead, they must first be encapsulated inside another packet. This
   packet must have the public source and destination IP addresses
   substituted for the private addresses.

   So if your outgoing packet started looking like this:

   .----------------------.
   | Src: 192.168.1.1     |
   | Dst: 192.168.2.1     |
   | <other header info>  |
   +----------------------+
   | <packet data>        |
   `----------------------'

   Then it will be encapsulated inside another packet, looking something like
   this:

   .--------------------------.
   | Src: A.B.C.D             |
   | Dst: W.X.Y.Z             |
   | <other header info>      |
   +--------------------------+
   | .----------------------. |
   | | Src: 192.168.1.1     | |
   | | Dst: 192.168.2.1     | |
   | | <other header info>  | |
   | +----------------------+ |
   | | <packet data>        | |
   | `----------------------' |
   `--------------------------'

   This encapsulation is carried out by the gif device. As you can see, the
   packet now has real IP addresses on the outside, and our original packet
   has been wrapped up as data inside the packet that will be put out on the
   Internet.

   Obviously, we want all traffic between the VPNs to be encrypted. You might
   try putting this in to words, as:

   ``If a packet leaves from A.B.C.D, and it is destined for W.X.Y.Z, then
   encrypt it, using the necessary security associations.''

   ``If a packet arrives from W.X.Y.Z, and it is destined for A.B.C.D, then
   decrypt it, using the necessary security associations.''

   That's close, but not quite right. If you did this, all traffic to and
   from W.X.Y.Z, even traffic that was not part of the VPN, would be
   encrypted. That's not quite what you want. The correct policy is as
   follows

   ``If a packet leaves from A.B.C.D, and that packet is encapsulating
   another packet, and it is destined for W.X.Y.Z, then encrypt it, using the
   necessary security associations.''

   ``If a packet arrives from W.X.Y.Z, and that packet is encapsulating
   another packet, and it is destined for A.B.C.D, then encrypt it, using the
   necessary security associations.''

   A subtle change, but a necessary one.

   Security policies are also set using setkey(8). setkey(8) features a
   configuration language for defining the policy. You can either enter
   configuration instructions via stdin, or you can use the -f option to
   specify a filename that contains configuration instructions.

   The configuration on gateway host #1 (which has the public IP address
   A.B.C.D) to force all outbound traffic to W.X.Y.Z to be encrypted is:

 spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P out ipsec esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
       

   Put these commands in a file (e.g., /etc/ipsec.conf) and then run

 # setkey -f /etc/ipsec.conf

   spdadd tells setkey(8) that we want to add a rule to the secure policy
   database. The rest of this line specifies which packets will match this
   policy. A.B.C.D/32 and W.X.Y.Z/32 are the IP addresses and netmasks that
   identify the network or hosts that this policy will apply to. In this
   case, we want it to apply to traffic between these two hosts. ipencap
   tells the kernel that this policy should only apply to packets that
   encapsulate other packets. -P out says that this policy applies to
   outgoing packets, and ipsec says that the packet will be secured.

   The second line specifies how this packet will be encrypted. esp is the
   protocol that will be used, while tunnel indicates that the packet will be
   further encapsulated in an IPsec packet. The repeated use of A.B.C.D and
   W.X.Y.Z is used to select the security association to use, and the final
   require mandates that packets must be encrypted if they match this rule.

   This rule only matches outgoing packets. You will need a similar rule to
   match incoming packets.

 spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P in ipsec esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;

   Note the in instead of out in this case, and the necessary reversal of the
   IP addresses.

   The other gateway host (which has the public IP address W.X.Y.Z) will need
   similar rules.

 spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P out ipsec esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
        spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P in ipsec esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;

   Finally, you need to add firewall rules to allow ESP and IPENCAP packets
   back and forth. These rules will need to be added to both hosts.

 ipfw add 1 allow esp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
 ipfw add 1 allow esp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
 ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
 ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
       

   Because the rules are symmetric you can use the same rules on each gateway
   host.

   Outgoing packets will now look something like this:

   .------------------------------.  --------------------------.
   | Src: A.B.C.D                 |                            |
   | Dst: W.X.Y.Z                 |                            |
   | <other header info>          |                            |  Encrypted
   +------------------------------+                            |  packet.
   | .--------------------------. |  -------------.            |  contents
   | | Src: A.B.C.D             | |               |            |  are
   | | Dst: W.X.Y.Z             | |               |            |  completely
   | | <other header info>      | |               |            |- secure
   | +--------------------------+ |               |  Encap'd   |  from third
   | | .----------------------. | |  -.           |  packet    |  party
   | | | Src: 192.168.1.1     | | |   |  Original |- with real |  snooping
   | | | Dst: 192.168.2.1     | | |   |  packet,  |  IP addr   |
   | | | <other header info>  | | |   |- private  |            |
   | | +----------------------+ | |   |  IP addr  |            |
   | | | <packet data>        | | |   |           |            |
   | | `----------------------' | |  -'           |            |
   | `--------------------------' |  -------------'            |
   `------------------------------'  --------------------------'
            

   When they are received by the far end of the VPN they will first be
   decrypted (using the security associations that have been negotiated by
   racoon). Then they will enter the gif interface, which will unwrap the
   second layer, until you are left with the innermost packet, which can then
   travel in to the inner network.

   You can check the security using the same ping(8) test from earlier.
   First, log in to the A.B.C.D gateway machine, and run:

 tcpdump dst host 192.168.2.1

   In another log in session on the same host run

 ping 192.168.2.1

   This time you should see output like the following:

 XXX tcpdump output

   Now, as you can see, tcpdump(1) shows the ESP packets. If you try to
   examine them with the -s option you will see (apparently) gibberish,
   because of the encryption.

   Congratulations. You have just set up a VPN between two remote sites.

   Summary

     * Configure both kernels with:

 options IPSEC
 options IPSEC_ESP
          

     * Install security/racoon. Edit ${PREFIX}/etc/racoon/psk.txt on both
       gateway hosts, adding an entry for the remote host's IP address and a
       secret key that they both know. Make sure this file is mode 0600.

     * Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf on each host:

 ipsec_enable="YES"
 ipsec_file="/etc/ipsec.conf"
          

     * Create an /etc/ipsec.conf on each host that contains the necessary
       spdadd lines. On gateway host #1 this would be:

 spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P out ipsec
   esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
 spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P in ipsec
   esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;

       On gateway host #2 this would be:

 spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P out ipsec
   esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
 spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P in ipsec
   esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;

     * Add firewall rules to allow IKE, ESP, and IPENCAP traffic to both
       hosts:

 ipfw add 1 allow udp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z isakmp
 ipfw add 1 allow udp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D isakmp
 ipfw add 1 allow esp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
 ipfw add 1 allow esp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
 ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
 ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
          

   The previous two steps should suffice to get the VPN up and running.
   Machines on each network will be able to refer to one another using IP
   addresses, and all traffic across the link will be automatically and
   securely encrypted.

10.10 OpenSSH

   Contributed by Chern Lee.

   OpenSSH is a set of network connectivity tools used to access remote
   machines securely. It can be used as a direct replacement for rlogin, rsh,
   rcp, and telnet. Additionally, any other TCP/IP connections can be
   tunneled/forwarded securely through SSH. OpenSSH encrypts all traffic to
   effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other
   network-level attacks.

   OpenSSH is maintained by the OpenBSD project, and is based upon SSH
   v1.2.12 with all the recent bug fixes and updates. It is compatible with
   both SSH protocols 1 and 2.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.1 Advantages of Using OpenSSH

   Normally, when using telnet(1) or rlogin(1), data is sent over the network
   in an clear, un-encrypted form. Network sniffers anywhere in between the
   client and server can steal your user/password information or data
   transferred in your session. OpenSSH offers a variety of authentication
   and encryption methods to prevent this from happening.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.2 Enabling sshd

   Be sure to make the following addition to your rc.conf file:

 sshd_enable="YES"

   This will load sshd(8), the daemon program for OpenSSH, the next time your
   system initializes. Alternatively, you can simply run directly the sshd
   daemon by typing sshd on the command line.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.3 SSH Client

   The ssh(1) utility works similarly to rlogin(1).

 # ssh user@example.com
 Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
 Host 'example.com' added to the list of known hosts.
 user@example.com's password: *******

   The login will continue just as it would have if a session was created
   using rlogin or telnet. SSH utilizes a key fingerprint system for
   verifying the authenticity of the server when the client connects. The
   user is prompted to enter yes only when connecting for the first time.
   Future attempts to login are all verified against the saved fingerprint
   key. The SSH client will alert you if the saved fingerprint differs from
   the received fingerprint on future login attempts. The fingerprints are
   saved in ~/.ssh/known_hosts, or ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 for SSH v2
   fingerprints.

   By default, OpenSSH servers are configured to accept both SSH v1 and SSH
   v2 connections. The client, however, can choose between the two. Version 2
   is known to be more robust and secure than its predecessor.

   The ssh(1) command can be forced to use either protocol by passing it the
   -1 or -2 argument for v1 and v2, respectively.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.4 Secure Copy

   The scp(1) command works similarly to rcp(1); it copies a file to or from
   a remote machine, except in a secure fashion.

 #  scp user@example.com:/COPYRIGHT COPYRIGHT
 user@example.com's password: *******
 COPYRIGHT            100% |*****************************|  4735      
 00:00   
 #

   Since the fingerprint was already saved for this host in the previous
   example, it is verified when using scp(1) here.

   The arguments passed to scp(1) are similar to cp(1), with the file or
   files in the first argument, and the destination in the second. Since the
   file is fetched over the network, through SSH, one or more of the file
   arguments takes on the form user@host:<path_to_remote_file>.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.5 Configuration

   The system-wide configuration files for both the OpenSSH daemon and client
   reside within the /etc/ssh directory.

   ssh_config configures the client settings, while sshd_config configures
   the daemon.

   Additionally, the sshd_program (/usr/sbin/sshd by default), and sshd_flags
   rc.conf options can provide more levels of configuration.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.6 ssh-keygen

   Instead of using passwords, ssh-keygen(1) can be used to generate RSA keys
   to authenticate a user:

 % ssh-keygen -t rsa1
 Initializing random number generator...
 Generating p:  .++ (distance 66)
 Generating q:  ..............................++ (distance 498)
 Computing the keys...
 Key generation complete.
 Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/identity):
 Enter passphrase:
 Enter the same passphrase again:
 Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/identity.
 ...

   ssh-keygen(1) will create a public and private key pair for use in
   authentication. The private key is stored in ~/.ssh/identity, whereas the
   public key is stored in ~/.ssh/identity.pub. The public key must be placed
   in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the remote machine in order for the setup to
   work.

   This will allow connection to the remote machine based upon RSA
   authentication instead of passwords.

     Note: The -t rsa1 option will create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol
     version 1. If you want to use RSA keys with the SSH protocol version 2,
     you have to use the command ssh-keygen -t rsa.

   If a passphrase is used in ssh-keygen(1), the user will be prompted for a
   password each time in order to use the private key.

   A SSH protocol version 2 DSA key can be created for the same purpose by
   using the ssh-keygen -t dsa command. This will create a public/private DSA
   key for use in SSH protocol version 2 sessions only. The public key is
   stored in ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub, while the private key is in ~/.ssh/id_dsa.

   DSA public keys are also placed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote
   machine.

   ssh-agent(1) and ssh-add(1) are utilities used in managing multiple
   passworded private keys.

     Warning: The various options and files can be different according to the
     OpenSSH version you have on your system, to avoid problems you should
     consult the ssh-keygen(1) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  10.10.7 SSH Tunneling

   OpenSSH has the ability to create a tunnel to encapsulate another protocol
   in an encrypted session.

   The following command tells ssh(1) to create a tunnel for telnet:

 % ssh -2 -N -f -L 5023:localhost:23 user@foo.example.com
 %

   The ssh command is used with the following options:

   -2

           Forces ssh to use version 2 of the protocol. (Do not use if you
           are working with older SSH servers)

   -N

           Indicates no command, or tunnel only. If omitted, ssh would
           initiate a normal session.

   -f

           Forces ssh to run in the background.

   -L

           Indicates a local tunnel in localport:remotehost:remoteport
           fashion.

   user@foo.example.com

           The remote SSH server.

   An SSH tunnel works by creating a listen socket on localhost on the
   specified port. It then forwards any connection received on the local
   host/port via the SSH connection to the specified remote host and port.

   In the example, port 5023 on localhost is being forwarded to port 23 on
   localhost of the remote machine. Since 23 is telnet, this would create a
   secure telnet session through an SSH tunnel.

   This can be used to wrap any number of insecure TCP protocols such as
   SMTP, POP3, FTP, etc.

   Example 10-1. Using SSH to Create a Secure Tunnel for SMTP

 % ssh -2 -N -f -L 5025:localhost:25 user@mailserver.example.com
 user@mailserver.example.com's password: *****
 % telnet localhost 5025
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 220 mailserver.example.com ESMTP

   This can be used in conjunction with an ssh-keygen(1) and additional user
   accounts to create a more seamless/hassle-free SSH tunneling environment.
   Keys can be used in place of typing a password, and the tunnels can be run
   as a separate user.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    10.10.7.1 Practical SSH Tunneling Examples

      10.10.7.1.1 Secure Access of a POP3 Server

   At work, there is an SSH server that accepts connections from the outside.
   On the same office network resides a mail server running a POP3 server.
   The network, or network path between your home and office may or may not
   be completely trustable. Because of this, you need to check your e-mail in
   a secure manner. The solution is to create an SSH connection to your
   office's SSH server, and tunnel through to the mail server.

 % ssh -2 -N -f -L 2110:mail.example.com:110 user@ssh-server.example.com
 user@ssh-server.example.com's password: ******

   When the tunnel is up and running, you can point your mail client to send
   POP3 requests to localhost port 2110. A connection here will be forwarded
   securely across the tunnel to mail.example.com.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      10.10.7.1.2 Bypassing a Draconian Firewall

   Some network administrators impose extremely draconian firewall rules,
   filtering not only incoming connections, but outgoing connections. You may
   be only given access to contact remote machines on ports 22 and 80 for SSH
   and web surfing.

   You may wish to access another (perhaps non-work related) service, such as
   an Ogg Vorbis server to stream music. If this Ogg Vorbis server is
   streaming on some other port than 22 or 80, you will not be able to access
   it.

   The solution is to create an SSH connection to a machine outside of your
   network's firewall, and use it to tunnel to the Ogg Vorbis server.

 % ssh -2 -N -f -L 8888:music.example.com:8000 user@unfirewalled-system.example.org
 user@unfirewalled-system.example.org's password: *******

   Your streaming client can now be pointed to localhost port 8888, which
   will be forwarded over to music.example.com port 8000, successfully
   evading the firewall.

   Contributed by Sean Kelly. Restructured and updated by Jim Mock.

11.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly can be used to print to a wide variety of printers, from the
   oldest impact printer to the latest laser printers, and everything in
   between, allowing you to produce high quality printed output from the
   applications you run.

   DragonFly can also be configured to act as a print server on a network; in
   this capacity DragonFly can receive print jobs from a variety of other
   computers, including other DragonFly computers, Windows and Mac OS hosts.
   DragonFly will ensure that one job at a time is printed, and can keep
   statistics on which users and machines are doing the most printing,
   produce ``banner'' pages showing who's printout is who's, and more.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to configure the DragonFly print spooler.

     * How to install print filters, to handle special print jobs
       differently, including converting incoming documents to print formats
       that your printers understand.

     * How to enable header, or banner pages on your printout.

     * How to print to printers connected to other computers.

     * How to print to printers connected directly to the network.

     * How to control printer restrictions, including limiting the size of
       print jobs, and preventing certain users from printing.

     * How to keep printer statistics, and account for printer usage.

     * How to troubleshoot printing problems.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to configure and install a new kernel (Chapter 9).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.2 Introduction

   In order to use printers with DragonFly, you will need to set them up to
   work with the Berkeley line printer spooling system, also known as the LPD
   spooling system. It is the standard printer control system in DragonFly.
   This chapter introduces the LPD spooling system, often simply called LPD,
   and will guide you through its configuration.

   If you are already familiar with LPD or another printer spooling system,
   you may wish to skip to section Setting up the spooling system.

   LPD controls everything about a host's printers. It is responsible for a
   number of things:

     * It controls access to attached printers and printers attached to other
       hosts on the network.

     * It enables users to submit files to be printed; these submissions are
       known as jobs.

     * It prevents multiple users from accessing a printer at the same time
       by maintaining a queue for each printer.

     * It can print header pages (also known as banner or burst pages) so
       users can easily find jobs they have printed in a stack of printouts.

     * It takes care of communications parameters for printers connected on
       serial ports.

     * It can send jobs over the network to a LPD spooler on another host.

     * It can run special filters to format jobs to be printed for various
       printer languages or printer capabilities.

     * It can account for printer usage.

   Through a configuration file (/etc/printcap), and by providing the special
   filter programs, you can enable the LPD system to do all or some subset of
   the above for a great variety of printer hardware.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.2.1 Why You Should Use the Spooler

   If you are the sole user of your system, you may be wondering why you
   should bother with the spooler when you do not need access control, header
   pages, or printer accounting. While it is possible to enable direct access
   to a printer, you should use the spooler anyway since:

     * LPD prints jobs in the background; you do not have to wait for data to
       be copied to the printer.

     * LPD can conveniently run a job to be printed through filters to add
       date/time headers or convert a special file format (such as a TeX DVI
       file) into a format the printer will understand. You will not have to
       do these steps manually.

     * Many free and commercial programs that provide a print feature usually
       expect to talk to the spooler on your system. By setting up the
       spooling system, you will more easily support other software you may
       later add or already have.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.3 Basic Setup

   To use printers with the LPD spooling system, you will need to set up both
   your printer hardware and the LPD software. This document describes two
   levels of setup:

     * See section Simple Printer Setup to learn how to connect a printer,
       tell LPD how to communicate with it, and print plain text files to the
       printer.

     * See section Advanced Printer Setup to find out how to print a variety
       of special file formats, to print header pages, to print across a
       network, to control access to printers, and to do printer accounting.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.3.1 Simple Printer Setup

   This section tells how to configure printer hardware and the LPD software
   to use the printer. It teaches the basics:

     * Section Hardware Setup gives some hints on connecting the printer to a
       port on your computer.

     * Section Software Setup shows how to set up the LPD spooler
       configuration file (/etc/printcap).

   If you are setting up a printer that uses a network protocol to accept
   data to print instead of a serial or parallel interface, see Printers With
   Networked Data Stream Interfaces.

   Although this section is called ``Simple Printer Setup'', it is actually
   fairly complex. Getting the printer to work with your computer and the LPD
   spooler is the hardest part. The advanced options like header pages and
   accounting are fairly easy once you get the printer working.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.3.1.1 Hardware Setup

   This section tells about the various ways you can connect a printer to
   your PC. It talks about the kinds of ports and cables, and also the kernel
   configuration you may need to enable DragonFly to speak to the printer.

   If you have already connected your printer and have successfully printed
   with it under another operating system, you can probably skip to section
   Software Setup.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.1.1 Ports and Cables

   Printers sold for use on PC's today generally come with one or more of the
   following three interfaces:

     * Serial interfaces, also known as RS232C or RS232D, or COM ports, use a
       serial port on your computer to send data to the printer. Serial
       interfaces are common in the computer industry and cables are readily
       available and also easy to construct. Serial interfaces sometimes need
       special cables and might require you to configure somewhat complex
       communications options. Most PC serial ports have a maximum
       transmission rate of 115200 bps, which makes printing large graphic
       print jobs with them impractical.

     * Parallel interfaces use a parallel port on your computer to send data
       to the printer. Parallel interfaces are common in the PC market and
       are faster than RS232 serial. Cables are readily available but more
       difficult to construct by hand. There are usually no communications
       options with parallel interfaces, making their configuration
       exceedingly simple.

       Parallel interfaces are sometimes known as ``Centronics'' interfaces,
       named after the connector type on the printer.

     * USB interfaces, named for the Universal Serial Bus, can run at even
       faster speeds than parallel or RS232 serial interfaces. Cables are
       simple and cheap. USB is superior to RS232 Serial and to Parallel for
       printing, but it is not as well supported under UNIX systems. A way to
       avoid this problem is to purchase a printer that has both a USB
       interface and a Parallel interface, as many printers do.

   In general, Parallel interfaces usually offer just one-way communication
   (computer to printer) while serial and USB gives you two-way. Newer
   parallel ports (EPP and ECP) and printers can communicate in both
   directions under DragonFly when a IEEE1284 compliant cable is used.

   Two-way communication to the printer over a parallel port is generally
   done one of two ways. The first method uses a custom built printer driver
   for DragonFly that speaks the proprietary language used by the printer.
   This is common with inkjet printers and can be used for reporting ink
   levels and other status information. The second method is used when the
   printer supports PostScript.

   PostScript jobs are actually programs sent to the printer; they need not
   produce paper at all and may return results directly to the computer.
   PostScript also uses two-way communication to tell the computer about
   problems, such as errors in the PostScript program or paper jams. Your
   users may be appreciative of such information. Furthermore, the best way
   to do effective accounting with a PostScript printer requires two-way
   communication: you ask the printer for its page count (how many pages it
   has printed in its lifetime), then send the user's job, then ask again for
   its page count. Subtract the two values and you know how much paper to
   charge the user.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.1.2 Parallel Ports

   To hook up a printer using a parallel interface, connect the Centronics
   cable between the printer and the computer. The instructions that came
   with the printer, the computer, or both should give you complete guidance.

   Remember which parallel port you used on the computer. The first parallel
   port is /dev/ppc0 to DragonFly; the second is /dev/ppc1, and so on. The
   printer device name uses the same scheme: /dev/lpt0 for the printer on the
   first parallel ports etc.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.1.3 Serial Ports

   To hook up a printer using a serial interface, connect the proper serial
   cable between the printer and the computer. The instructions that came
   with the printer, the computer, or both should give you complete guidance.

   If you are unsure what the ``proper serial cable'' is, you may wish to try
   one of the following alternatives:

     * A modem cable connects each pin of the connector on one end of the
       cable straight through to its corresponding pin of the connector on
       the other end. This type of cable is also known as a ``DTE-to-DCE''
       cable.

     * A null-modem cable connects some pins straight through, swaps others
       (send data to receive data, for example), and shorts some internally
       in each connector hood. This type of cable is also known as a
       ``DTE-to-DTE'' cable.

     * A serial printer cable, required for some unusual printers, is like
       the null-modem cable, but sends some signals to their counterparts
       instead of being internally shorted.

   You should also set up the communications parameters for the printer,
   usually through front-panel controls or DIP switches on the printer.
   Choose the highest bps (bits per second, sometimes baud rate) rate that
   both your computer and the printer can support. Choose 7 or 8 data bits;
   none, even, or odd parity; and 1 or 2 stop bits. Also choose a flow
   control protocol: either none, or XON/XOFF (also known as ``in-band'' or
   ``software'') flow control. Remember these settings for the software
   configuration that follows.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.3.1.2 Software Setup

   This section describes the software setup necessary to print with the LPD
   spooling system in DragonFly.

   Here is an outline of the steps involved:

    1. Configure your kernel, if necessary, for the port you are using for
       the printer; section Kernel Configuration tells you what you need to
       do.

    2. Set the communications mode for the parallel port, if you are using a
       parallel port; section Setting the Communication Mode for the Parallel
       Port gives details.

    3. Test if the operating system can send data to the printer. Section
       Checking Printer Communications gives some suggestions on how to do
       this.

    4. Set up LPD for the printer by modifying the file /etc/printcap. You
       will find out how to do this later in this chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.2.1 Kernel Configuration

   The operating system kernel is compiled to work with a specific set of
   devices. The serial or parallel interface for your printer is a part of
   that set. Therefore, it might be necessary to add support for an
   additional serial or parallel port if your kernel is not already
   configured for one.

   To find out if the kernel you are currently using supports a serial
   interface, type:

 # grep sioN /var/run/dmesg.boot

   Where N is the number of the serial port, starting from zero. If you see
   output similar to the following:

 sio2 at port 0x3e8-0x3ef irq 5 on isa
 sio2: type 16550A

   then the kernel supports the port.

   To find out if the kernel supports a parallel interface, type:

 # grep ppcN /var/run/dmesg.boot

   Where N is the number of the parallel port, starting from zero. If you see
   output similar to the following:

 ppc0: <Parallel port> at port 0x378-0x37f irq 7 on isa0
 ppc0: SMC-like chipset (ECP/EPP/PS2/NIBBLE) in COMPATIBLE mode
 ppc0: FIFO with 16/16/8 bytes threshold

   then the kernel supports the port.

   You might have to reconfigure your kernel in order for the operating
   system to recognize and use the parallel or serial port you are using for
   the printer.

   To add support for a serial port, see the section on kernel configuration.
   To add support for a parallel port, see that section and the section that
   follows.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.3.1.3 Adding /dev Entries for the Ports

   Even though the kernel may support communication along a serial or
   parallel port, you will still need a software interface through which
   programs running on the system can send and receive data. That is what
   entries in the /dev directory are for.

   To add a /dev entry for a port:

    1. Become root with the su(1) command. Enter the root password when
       prompted.

    2. Change to the /dev directory:

 # cd /dev

    3. Type:

 # ./MAKEDEV port

       Where port is the device entry for the port you want to make. Use lpt0
       for the printer on the first parallel port, lpt1 for the printer on
       the second port, and so on; use ttyd0 for the first serial port, ttyd1
       for the second, and so on.

    4. Type:

 # ls -l port

       to make sure the device entry got created.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.3.1 Setting the Communication Mode for the Parallel Port

   When you are using the parallel interface, you can choose whether
   DragonFly should use interrupt-driven or polled communication with the
   printer. The generic printer device driver (lpt(4)) on DragonFly uses the
   ppbus(4) system, which controls the port chipset with the ppc(4) driver.

     * The interrupt-driven method is the default with the GENERIC kernel.
       With this method, the operating system uses an IRQ line to determine
       when the printer is ready for data.

     * The polled method directs the operating system to repeatedly ask the
       printer if it is ready for more data. When it responds ready, the
       kernel sends more data.

   The interrupt-driven method is usually somewhat faster but uses up a
   precious IRQ line. Some newer HP printers are claimed not to work
   correctly in interrupt mode, apparently due to some (not yet exactly
   understood) timing problem. These printers need polled mode. You should
   use whichever one works. Some printers will work in both modes, but are
   painfully slow in interrupt mode.

   You can set the communications mode in two ways: by configuring the kernel
   or by using the lptcontrol(8) program.

   To set the communications mode by configuring the kernel:

    1. Edit your kernel configuration file. Look for an ppc0 entry. If you
       are setting up the second parallel port, use ppc1 instead. Use ppc2
       for the third port, and so on.

          * If you want interrupt-driven mode, add the irq specifier:

 device ppc0 at isa? irq N

            Where N is the IRQ number for your computer's parallel port.

          * If you want polled mode, do not add the irq specifier. Use the
            following line in your kernel configuration file:

 device ppc0 at isa?

    2. Save the file. Then configure, build, and install the kernel, then
       reboot. See kernel configuration for more details.

   To set the communications mode with lptcontrol(8):

    1. Type:

 # lptcontrol -i -d /dev/lptN

       to set interrupt-driven mode for lptN.

    2. Type:

 # lptcontrol -p -d /dev/lptN

       to set polled-mode for lptN.

   You could put these commands in your /etc/rc.local file to set the mode
   each time your system boots. See lptcontrol(8) for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.3.2 Checking Printer Communications

   Before proceeding to configure the spooling system, you should make sure
   the operating system can successfully send data to your printer. It is a
   lot easier to debug printer communication and the spooling system
   separately.

   To test the printer, we will send some text to it. For printers that can
   immediately print characters sent to them, the program lptest(1) is
   perfect: it generates all 96 printable ASCII characters in 96 lines.

   For a PostScript (or other language-based) printer, we will need a more
   sophisticated test. A small PostScript program, such as the following,
   will suffice:

 %!PS
 100 100 moveto 300 300 lineto stroke
 310 310 moveto /Helvetica findfont 12 scalefont setfont
 (Is this thing working?) show
 showpage

   The above PostScript code can be placed into a file and used as shown in
   the examples appearing in the following sections.

     Note: When this document refers to a printer language, it is assuming a
     language like PostScript, and not Hewlett Packard's PCL. Although PCL
     has great functionality, you can intermingle plain text with its escape
     sequences. PostScript cannot directly print plain text, and that is the
     kind of printer language for which we must make special accommodations.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        11.3.1.3.2.1 Checking a Parallel Printer

   This section tells you how to check if DragonFly can communicate with a
   printer connected to a parallel port.

   To test a printer on a parallel port:

    1. Become root with su(1).

    2. Send data to the printer.

          * If the printer can print plain text, then use lptest(1). Type:

 # lptest > /dev/lptN

            Where N is the number of the parallel port, starting from zero.

          * If the printer understands PostScript or other printer language,
            then send a small program to the printer. Type:

 # cat > /dev/lptN

            Then, line by line, type the program carefully as you cannot edit
            a line once you have pressed RETURN or ENTER. When you have
            finished entering the program, press CONTROL+D, or whatever your
            end of file key is.

            Alternatively, you can put the program in a file and type:

 # cat file > /dev/lptN

            Where file is the name of the file containing the program you
            want to send to the printer.

   You should see something print. Do not worry if the text does not look
   right; we will fix such things later.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        11.3.1.3.2.2 Checking a Serial Printer

   This section tells you how to check if DragonFly can communicate with a
   printer on a serial port.

   To test a printer on a serial port:

    1. Become root with su(1).

    2. Edit the file /etc/remote. Add the following entry:

 printer:dv=/dev/port:br#bps-rate:pa=parity

       Where port is the device entry for the serial port (ttyd0, ttyd1,
       etc.), bps-rate is the bits-per-second rate at which the printer
       communicates, and parity is the parity required by the printer (either
       even, odd, none, or zero).

       Here is a sample entry for a printer connected via a serial line to
       the third serial port at 19200 bps with no parity:

 printer:dv=/dev/ttyd2:br#19200:pa=none

    3. Connect to the printer with tip(1). Type:

 # tip printer

       If this step does not work, edit the file /etc/remote again and try
       using /dev/cuaaN instead of /dev/ttydN.

    4. Send data to the printer.

          * If the printer can print plain text, then use lptest(1). Type:

 % $lptest

          * If the printer understands PostScript or other printer language,
            then send a small program to the printer. Type the program, line
            by line, very carefully as backspacing or other editing keys may
            be significant to the printer. You may also need to type a
            special end-of-file key for the printer so it knows it received
            the whole program. For PostScript printers, press CONTROL+D.

            Alternatively, you can put the program in a file and type:

 % >file

            Where file is the name of the file containing the program. After
            tip(1) sends the file, press any required end-of-file key.

   You should see something print. Do not worry if the text does not look
   right; we will fix that later.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.3.1.4 Enabling the Spooler: the /etc/printcap File

   At this point, your printer should be hooked up, your kernel configured to
   communicate with it (if necessary), and you have been able to send some
   simple data to the printer. Now, we are ready to configure LPD to control
   access to your printer.

   You configure LPD by editing the file /etc/printcap. The LPD spooling
   system reads this file each time the spooler is used, so updates to the
   file take immediate effect.

   The format of the printcap(5) file is straightforward. Use your favorite
   text editor to make changes to /etc/printcap. The format is identical to
   other capability files like /usr/share/misc/termcap and /etc/remote. For
   complete information about the format, see the cgetent(3).

   The simple spooler configuration consists of the following steps:

    1. Pick a name (and a few convenient aliases) for the printer, and put
       them in the /etc/printcap file; see the Naming the Printer section for
       more information on naming.

    2. Turn off header pages (which are on by default) by inserting the sh
       capability; see the Suppressing Header Pages section for more
       information.

    3. Make a spooling directory, and specify its location with the sd
       capability; see the Making the Spooling Directory section for more
       information.

    4. Set the /dev entry to use for the printer, and note it in
       /etc/printcap with the lp capability; see the Identifying the Printer
       Device for more information. Also, if the printer is on a serial port,
       set up the communication parameters with the ms# capability which is
       discussed in the Configuring Spooler Communications Parameters
       section.

    5. Install a plain text input filter; see the Installing the Text Filter
       section for details.

    6. Test the setup by printing something with the lpr(1) command. More
       details are available in the Trying It Out and Troubleshooting
       sections.

     Note: Language-based printers, such as PostScript printers, cannot
     directly print plain text. The simple setup outlined above and described
     in the following sections assumes that if you are installing such a
     printer you will print only files that the printer can understand.

   Users often expect that they can print plain text to any of the printers
   installed on your system. Programs that interface to LPD to do their
   printing usually make the same assumption. If you are installing such a
   printer and want to be able to print jobs in the printer language and
   print plain text jobs, you are strongly urged to add an additional step to
   the simple setup outlined above: install an automatic
   plain-text-to-PostScript (or other printer language) conversion program.
   The section entitled Accommodating Plain Text Jobs on PostScript Printers
   tells how to do this.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.1 Naming the Printer

   The first (easy) step is to pick a name for your printer It really does
   not matter whether you choose functional or whimsical names since you can
   also provide a number of aliases for the printer.

   At least one of the printers specified in the /etc/printcap should have
   the alias lp. This is the default printer's name. If users do not have the
   PRINTER environment variable nor specify a printer name on the command
   line of any of the LPD commands, then lp will be the default printer they
   get to use.

   Also, it is common practice to make the last alias for a printer be a full
   description of the printer, including make and model.

   Once you have picked a name and some common aliases, put them in the
   /etc/printcap file. The name of the printer should start in the leftmost
   column. Separate each alias with a vertical bar and put a colon after the
   last alias.

   In the following example, we start with a skeletal /etc/printcap that
   defines two printers (a Diablo 630 line printer and a Panasonic KX-P4455
   PostScript laser printer):

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:

   In this example, the first printer is named rattan and has as aliases
   line, diablo, lp, and Diablo 630 Line Printer. Since it has the alias lp,
   it is also the default printer. The second is named bamboo, and has as
   aliases ps, PS, S, panasonic, and Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.2 Suppressing Header Pages

   The LPD spooling system will by default print a header page for each job.
   The header page contains the user name who requested the job, the host
   from which the job came, and the name of the job, in nice large letters.
   Unfortunately, all this extra text gets in the way of debugging the simple
   printer setup, so we will suppress header pages.

   To suppress header pages, add the sh capability to the entry for the
   printer in /etc/printcap. Here is an example /etc/printcap with sh added:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - no header pages anywhere
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:

   Note how we used the correct format: the first line starts in the leftmost
   column, and subsequent lines are indented with a single TAB. Every line in
   an entry except the last ends in a backslash character.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.3 Making the Spooling Directory

   The next step in the simple spooler setup is to make a spooling directory,
   a directory where print jobs reside until they are printed, and where a
   number of other spooler support files live.

   Because of the variable nature of spooling directories, it is customary to
   put these directories under /var/spool. It is not necessary to backup the
   contents of spooling directories, either. Recreating them is as simple as
   running mkdir(1).

   It is also customary to make the directory with a name that is identical
   to the name of the printer, as shown below:

 # mkdir /var/spool/printer-name

   However, if you have a lot of printers on your network, you might want to
   put the spooling directories under a single directory that you reserve
   just for printing with LPD. We will do this for our two example printers
   rattan and bamboo:

 # mkdir /var/spool/lpd
 # mkdir /var/spool/lpd/rattan
 # mkdir /var/spool/lpd/bamboo

     Note: If you are concerned about the privacy of jobs that users print,
     you might want to protect the spooling directory so it is not publicly
     accessible. Spooling directories should be owned and be readable,
     writable, and searchable by user daemon and group daemon, and no one
     else. We will do this for our example printers:

 # chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/rattan
 # chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/bamboo
 # chmod 770 /var/spool/lpd/rattan
 # chmod 770 /var/spool/lpd/bamboo

   Finally, you need to tell LPD about these directories using the
   /etc/printcap file. You specify the pathname of the spooling directory
   with the sd capability:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - added spooling directories
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:

   Note that the name of the printer starts in the first column but all other
   entries describing the printer should be indented with a tab and each line
   escaped with a backslash.

   If you do not specify a spooling directory with sd, the spooling system
   will use /var/spool/lpd as a default.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.4 Identifying the Printer Device

   In the Adding /dev Entries for the Ports section, we identified which
   entry in the /dev directory DragonFly will use to communicate with the
   printer. Now, we tell LPD that information. When the spooling system has a
   job to print, it will open the specified device on behalf of the filter
   program (which is responsible for passing data to the printer).

   List the /dev entry pathname in the /etc/printcap file using the lp
   capability.

   In our running example, let us assume that rattan is on the first parallel
   port, and bamboo is on a sixth serial port; here are the additions to
   /etc/printcap:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - identified what devices to use
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:

   If you do not specify the lp capability for a printer in your
   /etc/printcap file, LPD uses /dev/lp as a default. /dev/lp currently does
   not exist in DragonFly.

   If the printer you are installing is connected to a parallel port, skip to
   the section entitled, Installing the Text Filter. Otherwise, be sure to
   follow the instructions in the next section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.5 Configuring Spooler Communication Parameters

   For printers on serial ports, LPD can set up the bps rate, parity, and
   other serial communication parameters on behalf of the filter program that
   sends data to the printer. This is advantageous since:

     * It lets you try different communication parameters by simply editing
       the /etc/printcap file; you do not have to recompile the filter
       program.

     * It enables the spooling system to use the same filter program for
       multiple printers which may have different serial communication
       settings.

   The following /etc/printcap capabilities control serial communication
   parameters of the device listed in the lp capability:

   br#bps-rate

           Sets the communications speed of the device to bps-rate, where
           bps-rate can be 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
           2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200 bits-per-second.

   ms#stty-mode

           Sets the options for the terminal device after opening the device.
           stty(1) explains the available options.

   When LPD opens the device specified by the lp capability, it sets the
   characteristics of the device to those specified with the ms# capability.
   Of particular interest will be the parenb, parodd, cs5, cs6, cs7, cs8,
   cstopb, crtscts, and ixon modes, which are explained in the stty(1) manual
   page.

   Let us add to our example printer on the sixth serial port. We will set
   the bps rate to 38400. For the mode, we will set no parity with -parenb,
   8-bit characters with cs8, no modem control with clocal and hardware flow
   control with crtscts:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:\

      11.3.1.4.6 Installing the Text Filter

   We are now ready to tell LPD what text filter to use to send jobs to the
   printer. A text filter, also known as an input filter, is a program that
   LPD runs when it has a job to print. When LPD runs the text filter for a
   printer, it sets the filter's standard input to the job to print, and its
   standard output to the printer device specified with the lp capability.
   The filter is expected to read the job from standard input, perform any
   necessary translation for the printer, and write the results to standard
   output, which will get printed. For more information on the text filter,
   see the Filters section.

   For our simple printer setup, the text filter can be a small shell script
   that just executes /bin/cat to send the job to the printer. DragonFly
   comes with another filter called lpf that handles backspacing and
   underlining for printers that might not deal with such character streams
   well. And, of course, you can use any other filter program you want. The
   filter lpf is described in detail in section entitled lpf: a Text Filter.

   First, let us make the shell script /usr/local/libexec/if-simple be a
   simple text filter. Put the following text into that file with your
   favorite text editor:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # if-simple - Simple text input filter for lpd
 # Installed in /usr/local/libexec/if-simple
 #
 # Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.

 /bin/cat && exit 0
 exit 2

   Make the file executable:

 # chmod 555 /usr/local/libexec/if-simple

   And then tell LPD to use it by specifying it with the if capability in
   /etc/printcap. We will add it to the two printers we have so far in the
   example /etc/printcap:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - added text filter
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\ :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.7 Turn on LPD

   lpd(8) is run from /etc/rc, controlled by the lpd_enable variable. This
   variable defaults to NO. If you have not done so already, add the line:

 lpd_enable="YES"

   to /etc/rc.conf, and then either restart your machine, or just run lpd(8).

 # lpd

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.3.1.4.8 Trying It Out

   You have reached the end of the simple LPD setup. Unfortunately,
   congratulations are not quite yet in order, since we still have to test
   the setup and correct any problems. To test the setup, try printing
   something. To print with the LPD system, you use the command lpr(1), which
   submits a job for printing.

   You can combine lpr(1) with the lptest(1) program, introduced in section
   Checking Printer Communications to generate some test text.

   To test the simple LPD setup:

   Type:

 # lptest 20 5 | lpr -Pprinter-name

   Where printer-name is a the name of a printer (or an alias) specified in
   /etc/printcap. To test the default printer, type lpr(1) without any -P
   argument. Again, if you are testing a printer that expects PostScript,
   send a PostScript program in that language instead of using lptest(1). You
   can do so by putting the program in a file and typing lpr file.

   For a PostScript printer, you should get the results of the program. If
   you are using lptest(1), then your results should look like the following:

 !"#$%&'()*+,-./01234
 "#$%&'()*+,-./012345
 #$%&'()*+,-./0123456
 $%&'()*+,-./01234567
 %&'()*+,-./012345678

   To further test the printer, try downloading larger programs (for
   language-based printers) or running lptest(1) with different arguments.
   For example, lptest 80 60 will produce 60 lines of 80 characters each.

   If the printer did not work, see the Troubleshooting section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.4 Advanced Printer Setup

   This section describes filters for printing specially formatted files,
   header pages, printing across networks, and restricting and accounting for
   printer usage.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.4.1 Filters

   Although LPD handles network protocols, queuing, access control, and other
   aspects of printing, most of the real work happens in the filters. Filters
   are programs that communicate with the printer and handle its device
   dependencies and special requirements. In the simple printer setup, we
   installed a plain text filter--an extremely simple one that should work
   with most printers (section Installing the Text Filter).

   However, in order to take advantage of format conversion, printer
   accounting, specific printer quirks, and so on, you should understand how
   filters work. It will ultimately be the filter's responsibility to handle
   these aspects. And the bad news is that most of the time you have to
   provide filters yourself. The good news is that many are generally
   available; when they are not, they are usually easy to write.

   Also, DragonFly comes with one, /usr/libexec/lpr/lpf, that works with many
   printers that can print plain text. (It handles backspacing and tabs in
   the file, and does accounting, but that is about all it does.) There are
   also several filters and filter components in pkgsrc.

   Here is what you will find in this section:

     * Section How Filters Work, tries to give an overview of a filter's role
       in the printing process. You should read this section to get an
       understanding of what is happening ``under the hood'' when LPD uses
       filters. This knowledge could help you anticipate and debug problems
       you might encounter as you install more and more filters on each of
       your printers.

     * LPD expects every printer to be able to print plain text by default.
       This presents a problem for PostScript (or other language-based
       printers) which cannot directly print plain text. Section
       Accommodating Plain Text Jobs on PostScript Printers tells you what
       you should do to overcome this problem. You should read this section
       if you have a PostScript printer.

     * PostScript is a popular output format for many programs. Even some
       people (myself included) write PostScript code directly. But
       PostScript printers are expensive. Section Simulating PostScript on
       Non PostScript Printers tells how you can further modify a printer's
       text filter to accept and print PostScript data on a non PostScript
       printer. You should read this section if you do not have a PostScript
       printer.

     * Section Conversion Filters tells about a way you can automate the
       conversion of specific file formats, such as graphic or typesetting
       data, into formats your printer can understand. After reading this
       section, you should be able to set up your printers such that users
       can type lpr -t to print troff data, or lpr -d to print TeX DVI data,
       or lpr -v to print raster image data, and so forth. I recommend
       reading this section.

     * Section Output Filters tells all about a not often used feature of
       LPD: output filters. Unless you are printing header pages (see Header
       Pages), you can probably skip that section altogether.

     * Section lpf: a Text Filter describes lpf, a fairly complete if simple
       text filter for line printers (and laser printers that act like line
       printers) that comes with DragonFly. If you need a quick way to get
       printer accounting working for plain text, or if you have a printer
       which emits smoke when it sees backspace characters, you should
       definitely consider lpf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.1 How Filters Work

   As mentioned before, a filter is an executable program started by LPD to
   handle the device-dependent part of communicating with the printer.

   When LPD wants to print a file in a job, it starts a filter program. It
   sets the filter's standard input to the file to print, its standard output
   to the printer, and its standard error to the error logging file
   (specified in the lf capability in /etc/printcap, or /dev/console by
   default).

   Which filter LPD starts and the filter's arguments depend on what is
   listed in the /etc/printcap file and what arguments the user specified for
   the job on the lpr(1) command line. For example, if the user typed lpr -t,
   LPD would start the troff filter, listed in the tf capability for the
   destination printer. If the user wanted to print plain text, it would
   start the if filter (this is mostly true: see Output Filters for details).

   There are three kinds of filters you can specify in /etc/printcap:

     * The text filter, confusingly called the input filter in LPD
       documentation, handles regular text printing. Think of it as the
       default filter. LPD expects every printer to be able to print plain
       text by default, and it is the text filter's job to make sure
       backspaces, tabs, or other special characters do not confuse the
       printer. If you are in an environment where you have to account for
       printer usage, the text filter must also account for pages printed,
       usually by counting the number of lines printed and comparing that to
       the number of lines per page the printer supports. The text filter is
       started with the following argument list:

       filter-name [-c] -wwidth -llength -iindent -n login -h host acct-file

       where

            -c

                    appears if the job is submitted with lpr -l

            width

                    is the value from the pw (page width) capability
                    specified in /etc/printcap, default 132

            length

                    is the value from the pl (page length) capability,
                    default 66

            indent

                    is the amount of the indentation from lpr -i, default 0

            login

                    is the account name of the user printing the file

            host

                    is the host name from which the job was submitted

            acct-file

                    is the name of the accounting file from the af
                    capability.

     * A conversion filter converts a specific file format into one the
       printer can render onto paper. For example, ditroff typesetting data
       cannot be directly printed, but you can install a conversion filter
       for ditroff files to convert the ditroff data into a form the printer
       can digest and print. Section Conversion Filters tells all about them.
       Conversion filters also need to do accounting, if you need printer
       accounting. Conversion filters are started with the following
       arguments:

       filter-name -xpixel-width -ypixel-height -n login -h host acct-file

       where pixel-width is the value from the px capability (default 0) and
       pixel-height is the value from the py capability (default 0).
     * The output filter is used only if there is no text filter, or if
       header pages are enabled. In my experience, output filters are rarely
       used. Section Output Filters describe them. There are only two
       arguments to an output filter:

       filter-name -wwidth -llength

       which are identical to the text filters -w and -l arguments.

   Filters should also exit with the following exit status:

   exit 0

           If the filter printed the file successfully.

   exit 1

           If the filter failed to print the file but wants LPD to try to
           print the file again. LPD will restart a filter if it exits with
           this status.

   exit 2

           If the filter failed to print the file and does not want LPD to
           try again. LPD will throw out the file.

   The text filter that comes with the DragonFly release,
   /usr/libexec/lpr/lpf, takes advantage of the page width and length
   arguments to determine when to send a form feed and how to account for
   printer usage. It uses the login, host, and accounting file arguments to
   make the accounting entries.

   If you are shopping for filters, see if they are LPD-compatible. If they
   are, they must support the argument lists described above. If you plan on
   writing filters for general use, then have them support the same argument
   lists and exit codes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.2 Accommodating Plain Text Jobs on PostScript(R) Printers

   If you are the only user of your computer and PostScript (or other
   language-based) printer, and you promise to never send plain text to your
   printer and to never use features of various programs that will want to
   send plain text to your printer, then you do not need to worry about this
   section at all.

   But, if you would like to send both PostScript and plain text jobs to the
   printer, then you are urged to augment your printer setup. To do so, we
   have the text filter detect if the arriving job is plain text or
   PostScript. All PostScript jobs must start with %! (for other printer
   languages, see your printer documentation). If those are the first two
   characters in the job, we have PostScript, and can pass the rest of the
   job directly. If those are not the first two characters in the file, then
   the filter will convert the text into PostScript and print the result.

   How do we do this?

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.3 Simulating PostScript on Non PostScript Printers

   PostScript is the de facto standard for high quality typesetting and
   printing. PostScript is, however, an expensive standard. Thankfully,
   Aladdin Enterprises has a free PostScript work-alike called Ghostscript
   that runs with DragonFly. Ghostscript can read most PostScript files and
   can render their pages onto a variety of devices, including many brands of
   non-PostScript printers. By installing Ghostscript and using a special
   text filter for your printer, you can make your non PostScript printer act
   like a real PostScript printer.

   Ghostscript is in pkgsrc, if you would like to install it from there. You
   can fetch, build, and install it quite easily yourself, as well.

   To simulate PostScript, we have the text filter detect if it is printing a
   PostScript file. If it is not, then the filter will pass the file directly
   to the printer; otherwise, it will use Ghostscript to first convert the
   file into a format the printer will understand.

   Here is an example: the following script is a text filter for Hewlett
   Packard DeskJet 500 printers. For other printers, substitute the -sDEVICE
   argument to the gs (Ghostscript) command. (Type gs -h to get a list of
   devices the current installation of Ghostscript supports.)

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  ifhp - Print Ghostscript-simulated PostScript on a DeskJet 500
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/ifhp

 #
 #  Treat LF as CR+LF:
 #
 printf "\033&k2G" || exit 2

 #
 #  Read first two characters of the file
 #
 IFS="" read -r first_line
 first_two_chars=`expr "$first_line" : '\(..\)'`

 if [ "$first_two_chars" = "%!" ]; then
     #
     #  It is PostScript; use Ghostscript to scan-convert and print it.
     #
     #  Note that PostScript files are actually interpreted programs,
     #  and those programs are allowed to write to stdout, which will
     #  mess up the printed output.  So, we redirect stdout to stderr
     #  and then make descriptor 3 go to stdout, and have Ghostscript
     #  write its output there.  Exercise for the clever reader:
     #  capture the stderr output from Ghostscript and mail it back to
     #  the user originating the print job.
     #
     exec 3>&1 1>&2
     /usr/local/bin/gs -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=djet500 \
         -sOutputFile=/dev/fd/3 - && exit 0
 else
     #
     #  Plain text or HP/PCL, so just print it directly; print a form feed
     #  at the end to eject the last page.
     #
     echo "$first_line" && cat && printf "\033&l0H" &&
 exit 0
 fi

 exit 2

   Finally, you need to notify LPD of the filter via the if capability:

 :if=/usr/local/libexec/ifhp:

   That is it. You can type lpr plain.text and lpr whatever.ps and both
   should print successfully.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.4 Conversion Filters

   After completing the simple setup described in Simple Printer Setup, the
   first thing you will probably want to do is install conversion filters for
   your favorite file formats (besides plain ASCII text).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.4.1.4.1 Why Install Conversion Filters?

   Conversion filters make printing various kinds of files easy. As an
   example, suppose we do a lot of work with the TeX typesetting system, and
   we have a PostScript printer. Every time we generate a DVI file from TeX,
   we cannot print it directly until we convert the DVI file into PostScript.
   The command sequence goes like this:

 % dvips seaweed-analysis.dvi
 % lpr seaweed-analysis.ps

   By installing a conversion filter for DVI files, we can skip the hand
   conversion step each time by having LPD do it for us. Now, each time we
   get a DVI file, we are just one step away from printing it:

 % lpr -d seaweed-analysis.dvi

   We got LPD to do the DVI file conversion for us by specifying the -d
   option. Section Formatting and Conversion Options lists the conversion
   options.

   For each of the conversion options you want a printer to support, install
   a conversion filter and specify its pathname in /etc/printcap. A
   conversion filter is like the text filter for the simple printer setup
   (see section Installing the Text Filter) except that instead of printing
   plain text, the filter converts the file into a format the printer can
   understand.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.4.1.4.2 Which Conversions Filters Should I Install?

   You should install the conversion filters you expect to use. If you print
   a lot of DVI data, then a DVI conversion filter is in order. If you have
   got plenty of troff to print out, then you probably want a troff filter.

   The following table summarizes the filters that LPD works with, their
   capability entries for the /etc/printcap file, and how to invoke them with
   the lpr command:

    File type   /etc/printcap capability   lpr option    
   cifplot      cf                       -c              
   DVI          df                       -d              
   plot         gf                       -g              
   ditroff      nf                       -n              
   FORTRAN text rf                       -f              
   troff        tf                       -f              
   raster       vf                       -v              
   plain text   if                       none, -p, or -l 

   In our example, using lpr -d means the printer needs a df capability in
   its entry in /etc/printcap.

   Despite what others might contend, formats like FORTRAN text and plot are
   probably obsolete. At your site, you can give new meanings to these or any
   of the formatting options just by installing custom filters. For example,
   suppose you would like to directly print Printerleaf files (files from the
   Interleaf desktop publishing program), but will never print plot files.
   You could install a Printerleaf conversion filter under the gf capability
   and then educate your users that lpr -g mean ``print Printerleaf files.''

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.4.1.4.3 Installing Conversion Filters

   Since conversion filters are programs you install outside of the base
   DragonFly installation, they should probably go under /usr/local. The
   directory /usr/local/libexec is a popular location, since they are
   specialized programs that only LPD will run; regular users should not ever
   need to run them.

   To enable a conversion filter, specify its pathname under the appropriate
   capability for the destination printer in /etc/printcap.

   In our example, we will add the DVI conversion filter to the entry for the
   printer named bamboo. Here is the example /etc/printcap file again, with
   the new df capability for the printer bamboo.

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - added df filter for bamboo
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:rw:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/psif:\
         :df=/usr/local/libexec/psdf:

   The DVI filter is a shell script named /usr/local/libexec/psdf. Here is
   that script:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  psdf - DVI to PostScript printer filter
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/psdf
 #
 # Invoked by lpd when user runs lpr -d
 #
 exec /usr/local/bin/dvips -f | /usr/local/libexec/lprps "$@"

   This script runs dvips in filter mode (the -f argument) on standard input,
   which is the job to print. It then starts the PostScript printer filter
   lprps (see section Accommodating Plain Text Jobs on PostScript Printers)
   with the arguments LPD passed to this script. lprps will use those
   arguments to account for the pages printed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.4.1.4.4 More Conversion Filter Examples

   Since there is no fixed set of steps to install conversion filters, let me
   instead provide more examples. Use these as guidance to making your own
   filters. Use them directly, if appropriate.

   This example script is a raster (well, GIF file, actually) conversion
   filter for a Hewlett Packard LaserJet III-Si printer:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  hpvf - Convert GIF files into HP/PCL, then print
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hpvf
                  
 PATH=/usr/X11R6/bin:$PATH; export PATH
 giftopnm | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtolj -resolution 300 \
     && exit 0 \
     || exit 2

   It works by converting the GIF file into a portable anymap, converting
   that into a portable graymap, converting that into a portable bitmap, and
   converting that into LaserJet/PCL-compatible data.

   Here is the /etc/printcap file with an entry for a printer using the above
   filter:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host orchid
 #
 teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/hpif:\
         :vf=/usr/local/libexec/hpvf:

   The following script is a conversion filter for troff data from the groff
   typesetting system for the PostScript printer named bamboo:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  pstf - Convert groff's troff data into PS, then print.
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/pstf
 #
 exec grops | /usr/local/libexec/lprps "$@"

   The above script makes use of lprps again to handle the communication with
   the printer. If the printer were on a parallel port, we would use this
   script instead:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  pstf - Convert groff's troff data into PS, then print.
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/pstf
 #
 exec grops

   That is it. Here is the entry we need to add to /etc/printcap to enable
   the filter:

 :tf=/usr/local/libexec/pstf:

   Here is an example that might make old hands at FORTRAN blush. It is a
   FORTRAN-text filter for any printer that can directly print plain text. We
   will install it for the printer teak:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # hprf - FORTRAN text filter for LaserJet 3si:
 # Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hprf
 #

 printf "\033&k2G" && fpr && printf "\033&l0H" &&
  exit 0
 exit 2

   And we will add this line to the /etc/printcap for the printer teak to
   enable this filter:

 :rf=/usr/local/libexec/hprf:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      11.4.1.4.5 Automated Conversion: an Alternative to Conversion Filters

   All these conversion filters accomplish a lot for your printing
   environment, but at the cost forcing the user to specify (on the lpr(1)
   command line) which one to use. If your users are not particularly
   computer literate, having to specify a filter option will become annoying.
   What is worse, though, is that an incorrectly specified filter option may
   run a filter on the wrong type of file and cause your printer to spew out
   hundreds of sheets of paper.

   Rather than install conversion filters at all, you might want to try
   having the text filter (since it is the default filter) detect the type of
   file it has been asked to print and then automatically run the right
   conversion filter. Tools such as file can be of help here. Of course, it
   will be hard to determine the differences between some file types--and, of
   course, you can still provide conversion filters just for them.

   The pkgsrc collection has a text filter that performs automatic conversion
   called apsfilter. It can detect plain text, PostScript, and DVI files, run
   the proper conversions, and print.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.5 Output Filters

   The LPD spooling system supports one other type of filter that we have not
   yet explored: an output filter. An output filter is intended for printing
   plain text only, like the text filter, but with many simplifications. If
   you are using an output filter but no text filter, then:

     * LPD starts an output filter once for the entire job instead of once
       for each file in the job.

     * LPD does not make any provision to identify the start or the end of
       files within the job for the output filter.

     * LPD does not pass the user's login or host to the filter, so it is not
       intended to do accounting. In fact, it gets only two arguments:

       filter-name -wwidth -llength

       Where width is from the pw capability and length is from the pl
       capability for the printer in question.

   Do not be seduced by an output filter's simplicity. If you would like each
   file in a job to start on a different page an output filter will not work.
   Use a text filter (also known as an input filter); see section Installing
   the Text Filter. Furthermore, an output filter is actually more complex in
   that it has to examine the byte stream being sent to it for special flag
   characters and must send signals to itself on behalf of LPD.

   However, an output filter is necessary if you want header pages and need
   to send escape sequences or other initialization strings to be able to
   print the header page. (But it is also futile if you want to charge header
   pages to the requesting user's account, since LPD does not give any user
   or host information to the output filter.)

   On a single printer, LPD allows both an output filter and text or other
   filters. In such cases, LPD will start the output filter to print the
   header page (see section Header Pages) only. LPD then expects the output
   filter to stop itself by sending two bytes to the filter: ASCII 031
   followed by ASCII 001. When an output filter sees these two bytes (031,
   001), it should stop by sending SIGSTOP to itself. When LPD's done running
   other filters, it will restart the output filter by sending SIGCONT to it.

   If there is an output filter but no text filter and LPD is working on a
   plain text job, LPD uses the output filter to do the job. As stated
   before, the output filter will print each file of the job in sequence with
   no intervening form feeds or other paper advancement, and this is probably
   not what you want. In almost all cases, you need a text filter.

   The program lpf, which we introduced earlier as a text filter, can also
   run as an output filter. If you need a quick-and-dirty output filter but
   do not want to write the byte detection and signal sending code, try lpf.
   You can also wrap lpf in a shell script to handle any initialization codes
   the printer might require.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.1.6 lpf: a Text Filter

   The program /usr/libexec/lpr/lpf that comes with DragonFly is a text
   filter (input filter) that can indent output (job submitted with lpr -i),
   allow literal characters to pass (job submitted with lpr -l), adjust the
   printing position for backspaces and tabs in the job, and account for
   pages printed. It can also act like an output filter.

   lpf is suitable for many printing environments. And although it has no
   capability to send initialization sequences to a printer, it is easy to
   write a shell script to do the needed initialization and then execute lpf.

   In order for lpf to do page accounting correctly, it needs correct values
   filled in for the pw and pl capabilities in the /etc/printcap file. It
   uses these values to determine how much text can fit on a page and how
   many pages were in a user's job. For more information on printer
   accounting, see Accounting for Printer Usage.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.4.2 Header Pages

   If you have lots of users, all of them using various printers, then you
   probably want to consider header pages as a necessary evil.

   Header pages, also known as banner or burst pages identify to whom jobs
   belong after they are printed. They are usually printed in large, bold
   letters, perhaps with decorative borders, so that in a stack of printouts
   they stand out from the real documents that comprise users' jobs. They
   enable users to locate their jobs quickly. The obvious drawback to a
   header page is that it is yet one more sheet that has to be printed for
   every job, their ephemeral usefulness lasting not more than a few minutes,
   ultimately finding themselves in a recycling bin or rubbish heap. (Note
   that header pages go with each job, not each file in a job, so the paper
   waste might not be that bad.)

   The LPD system can provide header pages automatically for your printouts
   if your printer can directly print plain text. If you have a PostScript
   printer, you will need an external program to generate the header page;
   see Header Pages on PostScript Printers.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.2.1 Enabling Header Pages

   In the Simple Printer Setup section, we turned off header pages by
   specifying sh (meaning ``suppress header'') in the /etc/printcap file. To
   enable header pages for a printer, just remove the sh capability.

   Sounds too easy, right?

   You are right. You might have to provide an output filter to send
   initialization strings to the printer. Here is an example output filter
   for Hewlett Packard PCL-compatible printers:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  hpof - Output filter for Hewlett Packard PCL-compatible printers
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hpof

 printf "\033&k2G" || exit 2
 exec /usr/libexec/lpr/lpf

   Specify the path to the output filter in the of capability. See the Output
   Filters section for more information.

   Here is an example /etc/printcap file for the printer teak that we
   introduced earlier; we enabled header pages and added the above output
   filter:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host orchid
 #
 teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/hpif:\
         :vf=/usr/local/libexec/hpvf:\
         :of=/usr/local/libexec/hpof:

   Now, when users print jobs to teak, they get a header page with each job.
   If users want to spend time searching for their printouts, they can
   suppress header pages by submitting the job with lpr -h; see the Header
   Page Options section for more lpr(1) options.

     Note: LPD prints a form feed character after the header page. If your
     printer uses a different character or sequence of characters to eject a
     page, specify them with the ff capability in /etc/printcap.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.2.2 Controlling Header Pages

   By enabling header pages, LPD will produce a long header, a full page of
   large letters identifying the user, host, and job. Here is an example
   (kelly printed the job named outline from host rose):

       k                   ll       ll
       k                    l        l
       k                    l        l
       k   k     eeee       l        l     y    y
       k  k     e    e      l        l     y    y
       k k      eeeeee      l        l     y    y
       kk k     e           l        l     y    y
       k   k    e    e      l        l     y   yy
       k    k    eeee      lll      lll     yyy y
                                                y
                                           y    y
                                            yyyy


                                    ll
                           t         l        i
                           t         l
        oooo    u    u   ttttt       l       ii     n nnn     eeee

       r         oooo     ssss     eeee







                                               Job:  outline
                                               Date: Sun Sep 17 11:04:58 1995

   LPD appends a form feed after this text so the job starts on a new page
   (unless you have sf (suppress form feeds) in the destination printer's
   entry in /etc/printcap).

   If you prefer, LPD can make a short header; specify sb (short banner) in
   the /etc/printcap file. The header page will look like this:

 rose:kelly  Job: outline  Date: Sun Sep 17 11:07:51 1995

   Also by default, LPD prints the header page first, then the job. To
   reverse that, specify hl (header last) in /etc/printcap.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.2.3 Accounting for Header Pages

   Using LPD's built-in header pages enforces a particular paradigm when it
   comes to printer accounting: header pages must be free of charge.

   Why?

   Because the output filter is the only external program that will have
   control when the header page is printed that could do accounting, and it
   is not provided with any user or host information or an accounting file,
   so it has no idea whom to charge for printer use. It is also not enough to
   just ``add one page'' to the text filter or any of the conversion filters
   (which do have user and host information) since users can suppress header
   pages with lpr -h. They could still be charged for header pages they did
   not print. Basically, lpr -h will be the preferred option of
   environmentally-minded users, but you cannot offer any incentive to use
   it.

   It is still not enough to have each of the filters generate their own
   header pages (thereby being able to charge for them). If users wanted the
   option of suppressing the header pages with lpr -h, they will still get
   them and be charged for them since LPD does not pass any knowledge of the
   -h option to any of the filters.

   So, what are your options?

   You can:

     * Accept LPD's paradigm and make header pages free.

     * Install an alternative to LPD, such as LPRng. Section Alternatives to
       the Standard Spooler tells more about other spooling software you can
       substitute for LPD.

     * Write a smart output filter. Normally, an output filter is not meant
       to do anything more than initialize a printer or do some simple
       character conversion. It is suited for header pages and plain text
       jobs (when there is no text (input) filter). But, if there is a text
       filter for the plain text jobs, then LPD will start the output filter
       only for the header pages. And the output filter can parse the header
       page text that LPD generates to determine what user and host to charge
       for the header page. The only other problem with this method is that
       the output filter still does not know what accounting file to use (it
       is not passed the name of the file from the af capability), but if you
       have a well-known accounting file, you can hard-code that into the
       output filter. To facilitate the parsing step, use the sh (short
       header) capability in /etc/printcap. Then again, all that might be too
       much trouble, and users will certainly appreciate the more generous
       system administrator who makes header pages free.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.2.4 Header Pages on PostScript Printers

   As described above, LPD can generate a plain text header page suitable for
   many printers. Of course, PostScript cannot directly print plain text, so
   the header page feature of LPD is useless--or mostly so.

   One obvious way to get header pages is to have every conversion filter and
   the text filter generate the header page. The filters should use the user
   and host arguments to generate a suitable header page. The drawback of
   this method is that users will always get a header page, even if they
   submit jobs with lpr -h.

   Let us explore this method. The following script takes three arguments
   (user login name, host name, and job name) and makes a simple PostScript
   header page:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  make-ps-header - make a PostScript header page on stdout
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/make-ps-header
 #

 #
 #  These are PostScript units (72 to the inch).  Modify for A4 or
 #  whatever size paper you are using:
 #
 page_width=612
 page_height=792
 border=72

 #
 #  Check arguments
 #
 if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
     echo "Usage: `basename $0` <user> <host> <job>" 1>&2
     exit 1
 fi

 #
 #  Save these, mostly for readability in the PostScript, below.
 #
 user=$1
 host=$2
 job=$3
 date=`date`

 #
 #  Send the PostScript code to stdout.
 #
 exec cat <<EOF
 %!PS

 %
 %  Make sure we do not interfere with user's job that will follow
 %
 save

 %
 %  Make a thick, unpleasant border around the edge of the paper.
 %
 $border $border moveto
 $page_width $border 2 mul sub 0 rlineto
 0 $page_height $border 2 mul sub rlineto
 currentscreen 3 -1 roll pop 100 3 1 roll setscreen
 $border 2 mul $page_width sub 0 rlineto closepath
 0.8 setgray 10 setlinewidth stroke 0 setgray

 %
 %  Display user's login name, nice and large and prominent
 %
 /Helvetica-Bold findfont 64 scalefont setfont
 $page_width ($user) stringwidth pop sub 2 div $page_height 200 sub moveto
 ($user) show

 %
 %  Now show the boring particulars
 %
 /Helvetica findfont 14 scalefont setfont
 /y 200 def
 [ (Job:) (Host:) (Date:) ] {
 200 y moveto show /y y 18 sub def }
 forall

 /Helvetica-Bold findfont 14 scalefont setfont
 /y 200 def
 [ ($job) ($host) ($date) ] {
         270 y moveto show /y y 18 sub def
 } forall

 %
 % That is it
 %
 restore
 showpage
 EOF

   Now, each of the conversion filters and the text filter can call this
   script to first generate the header page, and then print the user's job.
   Here is the DVI conversion filter from earlier in this document, modified
   to make a header page:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  psdf - DVI to PostScript printer filter
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/psdf
 #
 #  Invoked by lpd when user runs lpr -d
 #
                
 orig_args="$@"

 fail() {
     echo "$@" 1>&2
     exit 2
 }

 while getopts "x:y:n:h:" option; do
     case $option in
         x|y)  ;; # Ignore
         n)    login=$OPTARG ;;
         h)    host=$OPTARG ;;
         *)    echo "LPD started `basename $0` wrong." 1>&2
               exit 2
               ;;
     esac
 done

 [ "$login" ] || fail "No login name"
 [ "$host" ] || fail "No host name"

 ( /usr/local/libexec/make-ps-header $login $host "DVI File"
   /usr/local/bin/dvips -f ) | eval /usr/local/libexec/lprps $orig_args

   Notice how the filter has to parse the argument list in order to determine
   the user and host name. The parsing for the other conversion filters is
   identical. The text filter takes a slightly different set of arguments,
   though (see section How Filters Work).

   As we have mentioned before, the above scheme, though fairly simple,
   disables the ``suppress header page'' option (the -h option) to lpr. If
   users wanted to save a tree (or a few pennies, if you charge for header
   pages), they would not be able to do so, since every filter's going to
   print a header page with every job.

   To allow users to shut off header pages on a per-job basis, you will need
   to use the trick introduced in section Accounting for Header Pages: write
   an output filter that parses the LPD-generated header page and produces a
   PostScript version. If the user submits the job with lpr -h, then LPD will
   not generate a header page, and neither will your output filter.
   Otherwise, your output filter will read the text from LPD and send the
   appropriate header page PostScript code to the printer.

   If you have a PostScript printer on a serial line, you can make use of
   lprps, which comes with an output filter, psof, which does the above. Note
   that psof does not charge for header pages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.4.3 Networked Printing

   DragonFly supports networked printing: sending jobs to remote printers.
   Networked printing generally refers to two different things:

     * Accessing a printer attached to a remote host. You install a printer
       that has a conventional serial or parallel interface on one host.
       Then, you set up LPD to enable access to the printer from other hosts
       on the network. Section Printers Installed on Remote Hosts tells how
       to do this.

     * Accessing a printer attached directly to a network. The printer has a
       network interface in addition (or in place of) a more conventional
       serial or parallel interface. Such a printer might work as follows:

          * It might understand the LPD protocol and can even queue jobs from
            remote hosts. In this case, it acts just like a regular host
            running LPD. Follow the same procedure in section Printers
            Installed on Remote Hosts to set up such a printer.

          * It might support a data stream network connection. In this case,
            you ``attach'' the printer to one host on the network by making
            that host responsible for spooling jobs and sending them to the
            printer. Section Printers with Networked Data Stream Interfaces
            gives some suggestions on installing such printers.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.3.1 Printers Installed on Remote Hosts

   The LPD spooling system has built-in support for sending jobs to other
   hosts also running LPD (or are compatible with LPD). This feature enables
   you to install a printer on one host and make it accessible from other
   hosts. It also works with printers that have network interfaces that
   understand the LPD protocol.

   To enable this kind of remote printing, first install a printer on one
   host, the printer host, using the simple printer setup described in the
   Simple Printer Setup section. Do any advanced setup in Advanced Printer
   Setup that you need. Make sure to test the printer and see if it works
   with the features of LPD you have enabled. Also ensure that the local host
   has authorization to use the LPD service in the remote host (see
   Restricting Jobs from Remote Printers).

   If you are using a printer with a network interface that is compatible
   with LPD, then the printer host in the discussion below is the printer
   itself, and the printer name is the name you configured for the printer.
   See the documentation that accompanied your printer and/or printer-network
   interface.

     Tip: If you are using a Hewlett Packard Laserjet then the printer name
     text will automatically perform the LF to CRLF conversion for you, so
     you will not require the hpif script.

   Then, on the other hosts you want to have access to the printer, make an
   entry in their /etc/printcap files with the following:

    1. Name the entry anything you want. For simplicity, though, you probably
       want to use the same name and aliases as on the printer host.

    2. Leave the lp capability blank, explicitly (:lp=:).

    3. Make a spooling directory and specify its location in the sd
       capability. LPD will store jobs here before they get sent to the
       printer host.

    4. Place the name of the printer host in the rm capability.

    5. Place the printer name on the printer host in the rp capability.

   That is it. You do not need to list conversion filters, page dimensions,
   or anything else in the /etc/printcap file.

   Here is an example. The host rose has two printers, bamboo and rattan. We
   will enable users on the host orchid to print to those printers. Here is
   the /etc/printcap file for orchid (back from section Enabling Header
   Pages). It already had the entry for the printer teak; we have added
   entries for the two printers on the host rose:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host orchid - added (remote) printers on rose
 #

 #
 #  teak is local; it is connected directly to orchid:
 #
 teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/ifhp:\
         :vf=/usr/local/libexec/vfhp:\
         :of=/usr/local/libexec/ofhp:

 #
 #  rattan is connected to rose; send jobs for rattan to rose:
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :lp=:rm=rose:rp=rattan:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:

 #
 #  bamboo is connected to rose as well:
 #
 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :lp=:rm=rose:rp=bamboo:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:

   Then, we just need to make spooling directories on orchid:

 # mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd/rattan /var/spool/lpd/bamboo
 # chmod 770 /var/spool/lpd/rattan /var/spool/lpd/bamboo
 # chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/rattan /var/spool/lpd/bamboo

   Now, users on orchid can print to rattan and bamboo. If, for example, a
   user on orchid typed

 % lpr -P bamboo -d sushi-review.dvi

   the LPD system on orchid would copy the job to the spooling directory
   /var/spool/lpd/bamboo and note that it was a DVI job. As soon as the host
   rose has room in its bamboo spooling directory, the two LPDs would
   transfer the file to rose. The file would wait in rose's queue until it
   was finally printed. It would be converted from DVI to PostScript (since
   bamboo is a PostScript printer) on rose.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.3.2 Printers with Networked Data Stream Interfaces

   Often, when you buy a network interface card for a printer, you can get
   two versions: one which emulates a spooler (the more expensive version),
   or one which just lets you send data to it as if you were using a serial
   or parallel port (the cheaper version). This section tells how to use the
   cheaper version. For the more expensive one, see the previous section
   Printers Installed on Remote Hosts.

   The format of the /etc/printcap file lets you specify what serial or
   parallel interface to use, and (if you are using a serial interface), what
   baud rate, whether to use flow control, delays for tabs, conversion of
   newlines, and more. But there is no way to specify a connection to a
   printer that is listening on a TCP/IP or other network port.

   To send data to a networked printer, you need to develop a communications
   program that can be called by the text and conversion filters. Here is one
   such example: the script netprint takes all data on standard input and
   sends it to a network-attached printer. We specify the hostname of the
   printer as the first argument and the port number to which to connect as
   the second argument to netprint. Note that this supports one-way
   communication only (DragonFly to printer); many network printers support
   two-way communication, and you might want to take advantage of that (to
   get printer status, perform accounting, etc.).

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 #
 #  netprint - Text filter for printer attached to network
 #  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/netprint
 #
 $#ARGV eq 1 || die "Usage: $0 <printer-hostname> <port-number>";

 $printer_host = $ARGV[0];
 $printer_port = $ARGV[1];

 require 'sys/socket.ph';

 ($ignore, $ignore, $protocol) = getprotobyname('tcp');
 ($ignore, $ignore, $ignore, $ignore, $address)
     = gethostbyname($printer_host);

 $sockaddr = pack('S n a4 x8', &AF_INET, $printer_port, $address);

 socket(PRINTER, &PF_INET, &SOCK_STREAM, $protocol)
     || die "Can't create TCP/IP stream socket: $!";
 connect(PRINTER, $sockaddr) || die "Can't contact $printer_host: $!";
 while (<STDIN>) { print PRINTER; }
 exit 0;

   We can then use this script in various filters. Suppose we had a Diablo
   750-N line printer connected to the network. The printer accepts data to
   print on port number 5100. The host name of the printer is scrivener. Here
   is the text filter for the printer:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 #  diablo-if-net - Text filter for Diablo printer `scrivener' listening
 #  on port 5100.   Installed in /usr/local/libexec/diablo-if-net
 #
 exec /usr/libexec/lpr/lpf "$@" | /usr/local/libexec/netprint scrivener 5100

  11.4.4 Restricting Printer Usage

   This section gives information on restricting printer usage. The LPD
   system lets you control who can access a printer, both locally or
   remotely, whether they can print multiple copies, how large their jobs can
   be, and how large the printer queues can get.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.4.1 Restricting Multiple Copies

   The LPD system makes it easy for users to print multiple copies of a file.
   Users can print jobs with lpr -#5 (for example) and get five copies of
   each file in the job. Whether this is a good thing is up to you.

   If you feel multiple copies cause unnecessary wear and tear on your
   printers, you can disable the -# option to lpr(1) by adding the sc
   capability to the /etc/printcap file. When users submit jobs with the -#
   option, they will see:

 lpr: multiple copies are not allowed

   Note that if you have set up access to a printer remotely (see section
   Printers Installed on Remote Hosts), you need the sc capability on the
   remote /etc/printcap files as well, or else users will still be able to
   submit multiple-copy jobs by using another host.

   Here is an example. This is the /etc/printcap file for the host rose. The
   printer rattan is quite hearty, so we will allow multiple copies, but the
   laser printer bamboo is a bit more delicate, so we will disable multiple
   copies by adding the sc capability:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - restrict multiple copies on bamboo
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:sc:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:rw:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/psif:\
         :df=/usr/local/libexec/psdf:

   Now, we also need to add the sc capability on the host orchid's
   /etc/printcap (and while we are at it, let us disable multiple copies for
   the printer teak):

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host orchid - no multiple copies for local
 #  printer teak or remote printer bamboo
 teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:sc:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/ifhp:\
         :vf=/usr/local/libexec/vfhp:\
         :of=/usr/local/libexec/ofhp:

 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :lp=:rm=rose:rp=rattan:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :lp=:rm=rose:rp=bamboo:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:sc:

   By using the sc capability, we prevent the use of lpr -#, but that still
   does not prevent users from running lpr(1) multiple times, or from
   submitting the same file multiple times in one job like this:

 % lpr forsale.sign forsale.sign forsale.sign forsale.sign forsale.sign

   There are many ways to prevent this abuse (including ignoring it) which
   you are free to explore.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.4.2 Restricting Access to Printers

   You can control who can print to what printers by using the UNIX group
   mechanism and the rg capability in /etc/printcap. Just place the users you
   want to have access to a printer in a certain group, and then name that
   group in the rg capability.

   Users outside the group (including root) will be greeted with ``lpr: Not a
   member of the restricted group'' if they try to print to the controlled
   printer.

   As with the sc (suppress multiple copies) capability, you need to specify
   rg on remote hosts that also have access to your printers, if you feel it
   is appropriate (see section Printers Installed on Remote Hosts).

   For example, we will let anyone access the printer rattan, but only those
   in group artists can use bamboo. Here is the familiar /etc/printcap for
   host rose:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose - restricted group for bamboo
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:sc:rg=artists:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:rw:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/psif:\
         :df=/usr/local/libexec/psdf:

   Let us leave the other example /etc/printcap file (for the host orchid)
   alone. Of course, anyone on orchid can print to bamboo. It might be the
   case that we only allow certain logins on orchid anyway, and want them to
   have access to the printer. Or not.

     Note: There can be only one restricted group per printer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.4.3 Controlling Sizes of Jobs Submitted

   If you have many users accessing the printers, you probably need to put an
   upper limit on the sizes of the files users can submit to print. After
   all, there is only so much free space on the filesystem that houses the
   spooling directories, and you also need to make sure there is room for the
   jobs of other users.

   LPD enables you to limit the maximum byte size a file in a job can be with
   the mx capability. The units are in BUFSIZ blocks, which are 1024 bytes.
   If you put a zero for this capability, there will be no limit on file
   size; however, if no mx capability is specified, then a default limit of
   1000 blocks will be used.

     Note: The limit applies to files in a job, and not the total job size.

   LPD will not refuse a file that is larger than the limit you place on a
   printer. Instead, it will queue as much of the file up to the limit, which
   will then get printed. The rest will be discarded. Whether this is correct
   behavior is up for debate.

   Let us add limits to our example printers rattan and bamboo. Since those
   artists' PostScript files tend to be large, we will limit them to five
   megabytes. We will put no limit on the plain text line printer:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host rose
 #

 #
 #  No limit on job size:
 #
 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:mx#0:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:

 #
 #  Limit of five megabytes:
 #
 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:sc:rg=artists:mx#5000:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:rw:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/psif:\
         :df=/usr/local/libexec/psdf:

   Again, the limits apply to the local users only. If you have set up access
   to your printers remotely, remote users will not get those limits. You
   will need to specify the mx capability in the remote /etc/printcap files
   as well. See section Printers Installed on Remote Hosts for more
   information on remote printing.

   There is another specialized way to limit job sizes from remote printers;
   see section Restricting Jobs from Remote Printers.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.4.4 Restricting Jobs from Remote Printers

   The LPD spooling system provides several ways to restrict print jobs
   submitted from remote hosts:

   Host restrictions

           You can control from which remote hosts a local LPD accepts
           requests with the files /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/hosts.lpd. LPD
           checks to see if an incoming request is from a host listed in
           either one of these files. If not, LPD refuses the request.

           The format of these files is simple: one host name per line. Note
           that the file /etc/hosts.equiv is also used by the ruserok(3)
           protocol, and affects programs like rsh(1) and rcp(1), so be
           careful.

           For example, here is the /etc/hosts.lpd file on the host rose:

 orchid
 violet
 madrigal.fishbaum.de

           This means rose will accept requests from the hosts orchid,
           violet, and madrigal.fishbaum.de. If any other host tries to
           access rose's LPD, the job will be refused.

   Size restrictions

           You can control how much free space there needs to remain on the
           filesystem where a spooling directory resides. Make a file called
           minfree in the spooling directory for the local printer. Insert in
           that file a number representing how many disk blocks (512 bytes)
           of free space there has to be for a remote job to be accepted.

           This lets you insure that remote users will not fill your
           filesystem. You can also use it to give a certain priority to
           local users: they will be able to queue jobs long after the free
           disk space has fallen below the amount specified in the minfree
           file.

           For example, let us add a minfree file for the printer bamboo. We
           examine /etc/printcap to find the spooling directory for this
           printer; here is bamboo's entry:

 bamboo|ps|PS|S|panasonic|Panasonic KX-P4455 PostScript v51.4:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/bamboo:sc:rg=artists:mx#5000:\
         :lp=/dev/ttyd5:ms#-parenb cs8 clocal crtscts:rw:mx#5000:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/psif:\
         :df=/usr/local/libexec/psdf:

           The spooling directory is given in the sd capability. We will make
           three megabytes (which is 6144 disk blocks) the amount of free
           disk space that must exist on the filesystem for LPD to accept
           remote jobs:

 # echo 6144 > /var/spool/lpd/bamboo/minfree
              

   User restrictions

           You can control which remote users can print to local printers by
           specifying the rs capability in /etc/printcap. When rs appears in
           the entry for a locally-attached printer, LPD will accept jobs
           from remote hosts if the user submitting the job also has an
           account of the same login name on the local host. Otherwise, LPD
           refuses the job.

           This capability is particularly useful in an environment where
           there are (for example) different departments sharing a network,
           and some users transcend departmental boundaries. By giving them
           accounts on your systems, they can use your printers from their
           own departmental systems. If you would rather allow them to use
           only your printers and not your computer resources, you can give
           them ``token'' accounts, with no home directory and a useless
           shell like /usr/bin/false.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.4.5 Accounting for Printer Usage

   So, you need to charge for printouts. And why not? Paper and ink cost
   money. And then there are maintenance costs--printers are loaded with
   moving parts and tend to break down. You have examined your printers,
   usage patterns, and maintenance fees and have come up with a per-page (or
   per-foot, per-meter, or per-whatever) cost. Now, how do you actually start
   accounting for printouts?

   Well, the bad news is the LPD spooling system does not provide much help
   in this department. Accounting is highly dependent on the kind of printer
   in use, the formats being printed, and your requirements in charging for
   printer usage.

   To implement accounting, you have to modify a printer's text filter (to
   charge for plain text jobs) and the conversion filters (to charge for
   other file formats), to count pages or query the printer for pages
   printed. You cannot get away with using the simple output filter, since it
   cannot do accounting. See section Filters.

   Generally, there are two ways to do accounting:

     * Periodic accounting is the more common way, possibly because it is
       easier. Whenever someone prints a job, the filter logs the user, host,
       and number of pages to an accounting file. Every month, semester,
       year, or whatever time period you prefer, you collect the accounting
       files for the various printers, tally up the pages printed by users,
       and charge for usage. Then you truncate all the logging files,
       starting with a clean slate for the next period.

     * Timely accounting is less common, probably because it is more
       difficult. This method has the filters charge users for printouts as
       soon as they use the printers. Like disk quotas, the accounting is
       immediate. You can prevent users from printing when their account goes
       in the red, and might provide a way for users to check and adjust
       their ``print quotas.'' But this method requires some database code to
       track users and their quotas.

   The LPD spooling system supports both methods easily: since you have to
   provide the filters (well, most of the time), you also have to provide the
   accounting code. But there is a bright side: you have enormous flexibility
   in your accounting methods. For example, you choose whether to use
   periodic or timely accounting. You choose what information to log: user
   names, host names, job types, pages printed, square footage of paper used,
   how long the job took to print, and so forth. And you do so by modifying
   the filters to save this information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.5.1 Quick and Dirty Printer Accounting

   DragonFly comes with two programs that can get you set up with simple
   periodic accounting right away. They are the text filter lpf, described in
   section lpf: a Text Filter, and pac(8), a program to gather and total
   entries from printer accounting files.

   As mentioned in the section on filters (Filters), LPD starts the text and
   the conversion filters with the name of the accounting file to use on the
   filter command line. The filters can use this argument to know where to
   write an accounting file entry. The name of this file comes from the af
   capability in /etc/printcap, and if not specified as an absolute path, is
   relative to the spooling directory.

   LPD starts lpf with page width and length arguments (from the pw and pl
   capabilities). lpf uses these arguments to determine how much paper will
   be used. After sending the file to the printer, it then writes an
   accounting entry in the accounting file. The entries look like this:

 2.00 rose:andy
 3.00 rose:kelly
 3.00 orchid:mary
 5.00 orchid:mary
 2.00 orchid:zhang

   You should use a separate accounting file for each printer, as lpf has no
   file locking logic built into it, and two lpfs might corrupt each other's
   entries if they were to write to the same file at the same time. An easy
   way to insure a separate accounting file for each printer is to use
   af=acct in /etc/printcap. Then, each accounting file will be in the
   spooling directory for a printer, in a file named acct.

   When you are ready to charge users for printouts, run the pac(8) program.
   Just change to the spooling directory for the printer you want to collect
   on and type pac. You will get a dollar-centric summary like the following:

   Login               pages/feet   runs    price
 orchid:kelly                5.00    1   $  0.10
 orchid:mary                31.00    3   $  0.62
 orchid:zhang                9.00    1   $  0.18
 rose:andy                   2.00    1   $  0.04
 rose:kelly                177.00  104   $  3.54
 rose:mary                  87.00   32   $  1.74
 rose:root                  26.00   12   $  0.52

 total                     337.00  154   $  6.74

   These are the arguments pac(8) expects:

   -Pprinter

           Which printer to summarize. This option works only if there is an
           absolute path in the af capability in /etc/printcap.

   -c

           Sort the output by cost instead of alphabetically by user name.

   -m

           Ignore host name in the accounting files. With this option, user
           smith on host alpha is the same user smith on host gamma. Without,
           they are different users.

   -pprice

           Compute charges with price dollars per page or per foot instead of
           the price from the pc capability in /etc/printcap, or two cents
           (the default). You can specify price as a floating point number.

   -r

           Reverse the sort order.

   -s

           Make an accounting summary file and truncate the accounting file.

   name ...

           Print accounting information for the given user names only.

   In the default summary that pac(8) produces, you see the number of pages
   printed by each user from various hosts. If, at your site, host does not
   matter (because users can use any host), run pac -m, to produce the
   following summary:

   Login               pages/feet   runs    price
 andy                        2.00    1   $  0.04
 kelly                     182.00  105   $  3.64
 mary                      118.00   35   $  2.36
 root                       26.00   12   $  0.52
 zhang                       9.00    1   $  0.18

 total                     337.00  154   $  6.74

   To compute the dollar amount due, pac(8) uses the pc capability in the
   /etc/printcap file (default of 200, or 2 cents per page). Specify, in
   hundredths of cents, the price per page or per foot you want to charge for
   printouts in this capability. You can override this value when you run
   pac(8) with the -p option. The units for the -p option are in dollars,
   though, not hundredths of cents. For example,

 # pac -p1.50

   makes each page cost one dollar and fifty cents. You can really rake in
   the profits by using this option.

   Finally, running pac -s will save the summary information in a summary
   accounting file, which is named the same as the printer's accounting file,
   but with _sum appended to the name. It then truncates the accounting file.
   When you run pac(8) again, it rereads the summary file to get starting
   totals, then adds information from the regular accounting file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.4.5.2 How Can You Count Pages Printed?

   In order to perform even remotely accurate accounting, you need to be able
   to determine how much paper a job uses. This is the essential problem of
   printer accounting.

   For plain text jobs, the problem is not that hard to solve: you count how
   many lines are in a job and compare it to how many lines per page your
   printer supports. Do not forget to take into account backspaces in the
   file which overprint lines, or long logical lines that wrap onto one or
   more additional physical lines.

   The text filter lpf (introduced in lpf: a Text Filter) takes into account
   these things when it does accounting. If you are writing a text filter
   which needs to do accounting, you might want to examine lpf's source code.

   How do you handle other file formats, though?

   Well, for DVI-to-LaserJet or DVI-to-PostScript conversion, you can have
   your filter parse the diagnostic output of dvilj or dvips and look to see
   how many pages were converted. You might be able to do similar things with
   other file formats and conversion programs.

   But these methods suffer from the fact that the printer may not actually
   print all those pages. For example, it could jam, run out of toner, or
   explode--and the user would still get charged.

   So, what can you do?

   There is only one sure way to do accurate accounting. Get a printer that
   can tell you how much paper it uses, and attach it via a serial line or a
   network connection. Nearly all PostScript printers support this notion.
   Other makes and models do as well (networked Imagen laser printers, for
   example). Modify the filters for these printers to get the page usage
   after they print each job and have them log accounting information based
   on that value only. There is no line counting nor error-prone file
   examination required.

   Of course, you can always be generous and make all printouts free.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.5 Using Printers

   This section tells you how to use printers you have set up with DragonFly.
   Here is an overview of the user-level commands:

   lpr(1)

           Print jobs

   lpq(1)

           Check printer queues

   lprm(1)

           Remove jobs from a printer's queue

   There is also an administrative command, lpc(8), described in the section
   Administering the LPD Spooler, used to control printers and their queues.

   All three of the commands lpr(1), lprm(1), and lpq(1) accept an option -P
   printer-name to specify on which printer/queue to operate, as listed in
   the /etc/printcap file. This enables you to submit, remove, and check on
   jobs for various printers. If you do not use the -P option, then these
   commands use the printer specified in the PRINTER environment variable.
   Finally, if you do not have a PRINTER environment variable, these commands
   default to the printer named lp.

   Hereafter, the terminology default printer means the printer named in the
   PRINTER environment variable, or the printer named lp when there is no
   PRINTER environment variable.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.5.1 Printing Jobs

   To print files, type:

 % lpr filename ...

   This prints each of the listed files to the default printer. If you list
   no files, lpr(1) reads data to print from standard input. For example,
   this command prints some important system files:

 % lpr /etc/host.conf /etc/hosts.equiv

   To select a specific printer, type:

 % lpr -P printer-name filename ...

   This example prints a long listing of the current directory to the printer
   named rattan:

 % ls -l | lpr -P rattan

   Because no files were listed for the lpr(1) command, lpr read the data to
   print from standard input, which was the output of the ls -l command.

   The lpr(1) command can also accept a wide variety of options to control
   formatting, apply file conversions, generate multiple copies, and so
   forth. For more information, see the section Printing Options.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.5.2 Checking Jobs

   When you print with lpr(1), the data you wish to print is put together in
   a package called a ``print job'', which is sent to the LPD spooling
   system. Each printer has a queue of jobs, and your job waits in that queue
   along with other jobs from yourself and from other users. The printer
   prints those jobs in a first-come, first-served order.

   To display the queue for the default printer, type lpq(1). For a specific
   printer, use the -P option. For example, the command

 % lpq -P bamboo

   shows the queue for the printer named bamboo. Here is an example of the
   output of the lpq command:

 bamboo is ready and printing
 Rank   Owner    Job  Files                              Total Size
 active kelly    9    /etc/host.conf, /etc/hosts.equiv   88 bytes
 2nd    kelly    10   (standard input)                   1635 bytes
 3rd    mary     11   ...                                78519 bytes

   This shows three jobs in the queue for bamboo. The first job, submitted by
   user kelly, got assigned ``job number'' 9. Every job for a printer gets a
   unique job number. Most of the time you can ignore the job number, but you
   will need it if you want to cancel the job; see section Removing Jobs for
   details.

   Job number nine consists of two files; multiple files given on the lpr(1)
   command line are treated as part of a single job. It is the currently
   active job (note the word active under the ``Rank'' column), which means
   the printer should be currently printing that job. The second job consists
   of data passed as the standard input to the lpr(1) command. The third job
   came from user mary; it is a much larger job. The pathname of the file she
   is trying to print is too long to fit, so the lpq(1) command just shows
   three dots.

   The very first line of the output from lpq(1) is also useful: it tells
   what the printer is currently doing (or at least what LPD thinks the
   printer is doing).

   The lpq(1) command also support a -l option to generate a detailed long
   listing. Here is an example of lpq -l:

 waiting for bamboo to become ready (offline ?)
 kelly: 1st                               [job 009rose]
        /etc/host.conf                    73 bytes
        /etc/hosts.equiv                  15 bytes

 kelly: 2nd                               [job 010rose]
        (standard input)                  1635 bytes

 mary: 3rd                                [job 011rose]
       /home/orchid/mary/research/venus/alpha-regio/mapping 78519 bytes

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.5.3 Removing Jobs

   If you change your mind about printing a job, you can remove the job from
   the queue with the lprm(1) command. Often, you can even use lprm(1) to
   remove an active job, but some or all of the job might still get printed.

   To remove a job from the default printer, first use lpq(1) to find the job
   number. Then type:

 % lprm job-number

   To remove the job from a specific printer, add the -P option. The
   following command removes job number 10 from the queue for the printer
   bamboo:

 % lprm -P bamboo 10

   The lprm(1) command has a few shortcuts:

   lprm -

           Removes all jobs (for the default printer) belonging to you.

   lprm user

           Removes all jobs (for the default printer) belonging to user. The
           superuser can remove other users' jobs; you can remove only your
           own jobs.

   lprm

           With no job number, user name, or - appearing on the command line,
           lprm(1) removes the currently active job on the default printer,
           if it belongs to you. The superuser can remove any active job.

   Just use the -P option with the above shortcuts to operate on a specific
   printer instead of the default. For example, the following command removes
   all jobs for the current user in the queue for the printer named rattan:

 % lprm -P rattan -

     Note: If you are working in a networked environment, lprm(1) will let
     you remove jobs only from the host from which the jobs were submitted,
     even if the same printer is available from other hosts. The following
     command sequence demonstrates this:

 % lpr -P rattan myfile
 % rlogin orchid
 % lpq -P rattan
 Rank   Owner      Job  Files                          Total Size
 active seeyan     12    ...                           49123 bytes
 2nd    kelly      13   myfile                         12 bytes
 % lprm -P rattan 13
 rose: Permission denied
 % logout
 % lprm -P rattan 13
 dfA013rose dequeued
 cfA013rose dequeued
        

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.5.4 Beyond Plain Text: Printing Options

   The lpr(1) command supports a number of options that control formatting
   text, converting graphic and other file formats, producing multiple
   copies, handling of the job, and more. This section describes the options.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.5.4.1 Formatting and Conversion Options

   The following lpr(1) options control formatting of the files in the job.
   Use these options if the job does not contain plain text or if you want
   plain text formatted through the pr(1) utility.

   For example, the following command prints a DVI file (from the TeX
   typesetting system) named fish-report.dvi to the printer named bamboo:

 % lpr -P bamboo -d fish-report.dvi

   These options apply to every file in the job, so you cannot mix (say) DVI
   and ditroff files together in a job. Instead, submit the files as separate
   jobs, using a different conversion option for each job.

     Note: All of these options except -p and -T require conversion filters
     installed for the destination printer. For example, the -d option
     requires the DVI conversion filter. Section Conversion Filters gives
     details.

   -c

           Print cifplot files.

   -d

           Print DVI files.

   -f

           Print FORTRAN text files.

   -g

           Print plot data.

   -i number

           Indent the output by number columns; if you omit number, indent by
           8 columns. This option works only with certain conversion filters.

             Note: Do not put any space between the -i and the number.

   -l

           Print literal text data, including control characters.

   -n

           Print ditroff (device independent troff) data.

   -p

           Format plain text with pr(1) before printing. See pr(1) for more
           information.

   -T title

           Use title on the pr(1) header instead of the file name. This
           option has effect only when used with the -p option.

   -t

           Print troff data.

   -v

           Print raster data.

   Here is an example: this command prints a nicely formatted version of the
   ls(1) manual page on the default printer:

 % zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | troff -t -man | lpr -t

   The zcat(1) command uncompresses the source of the ls(1) manual page and
   passes it to the troff(1) command, which formats that source and makes GNU
   troff output and passes it to lpr(1), which submits the job to the LPD
   spooler. Because we used the -t option to lpr(1), the spooler will convert
   the GNU troff output into a format the default printer can understand when
   it prints the job.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.5.4.2 Job Handling Options

   The following options to lpr(1) tell LPD to handle the job specially:

   -# copies

           Produce a number of copies of each file in the job instead of just
           one copy. An administrator may disable this option to reduce
           printer wear-and-tear and encourage photocopier usage. See section
           Restricting Multiple Copies.

           This example prints three copies of parser.c followed by three
           copies of parser.h to the default printer:

 % lpr -#3 parser.c parser.h

   -m

           Send mail after completing the print job. With this option, the
           LPD system will send mail to your account when it finishes
           handling your job. In its message, it will tell you if the job
           completed successfully or if there was an error, and (often) what
           the error was.

   -s

           Do not copy the files to the spooling directory, but make symbolic
           links to them instead.

           If you are printing a large job, you probably want to use this
           option. It saves space in the spooling directory (your job might
           overflow the free space on the filesystem where the spooling
           directory resides). It saves time as well since LPD will not have
           to copy each and every byte of your job to the spooling directory.

           There is a drawback, though: since LPD will refer to the original
           files directly, you cannot modify or remove them until they have
           been printed.

             Note: If you are printing to a remote printer, LPD will
             eventually have to copy files from the local host to the remote
             host, so the -s option will save space only on the local
             spooling directory, not the remote. It is still useful, though.

   -r

           Remove the files in the job after copying them to the spooling
           directory, or after printing them with the -s option. Be careful
           with this option!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    11.5.4.3 Header Page Options

   These options to lpr(1) adjust the text that normally appears on a job's
   header page. If header pages are suppressed for the destination printer,
   these options have no effect. See section Header Pages for information
   about setting up header pages.

   -C text

           Replace the hostname on the header page with text. The hostname is
           normally the name of the host from which the job was submitted.

   -J text

           Replace the job name on the header page with text. The job name is
           normally the name of the first file of the job, or stdin if you
           are printing standard input.

   -h

           Do not print any header page.

             Note: At some sites, this option may have no effect due to the
             way header pages are generated. See Header Pages for details.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  11.5.5 Administering Printers

   As an administrator for your printers, you have had to install, set up,
   and test them. Using the lpc(8) command, you can interact with your
   printers in yet more ways. With lpc(8), you can

     * Start and stop the printers

     * Enable and disable their queues

     * Rearrange the order of the jobs in each queue.

   First, a note about terminology: if a printer is stopped, it will not
   print anything in its queue. Users can still submit jobs, which will wait
   in the queue until the printer is started or the queue is cleared.

   If a queue is disabled, no user (except root) can submit jobs for the
   printer. An enabled queue allows jobs to be submitted. A printer can be
   started for a disabled queue, in which case it will continue to print jobs
   in the queue until the queue is empty.

   In general, you have to have root privileges to use the lpc(8) command.
   Ordinary users can use the lpc(8) command to get printer status and to
   restart a hung printer only.

   Here is a summary of the lpc(8) commands. Most of the commands take a
   printer-name argument to tell on which printer to operate. You can use all
   for the printer-name to mean all printers listed in /etc/printcap.

   abort printer-name

           Cancel the current job and stop the printer. Users can still
           submit jobs if the queue is enabled.

   clean printer-name

           Remove old files from the printer's spooling directory.
           Occasionally, the files that make up a job are not properly
           removed by LPD, particularly if there have been errors during
           printing or a lot of administrative activity. This command finds
           files that do not belong in the spooling directory and removes
           them.

   disable printer-name

           Disable queuing of new jobs. If the printer is running, it will
           continue to print any jobs remaining in the queue. The superuser
           (root) can always submit jobs, even to a disabled queue.

           This command is useful while you are testing a new printer or
           filter installation: disable the queue and submit jobs as root.
           Other users will not be able to submit jobs until you complete
           your testing and re-enable the queue with the enable command.

   down printer-name message

           Take a printer down. Equivalent to disable followed by stop. The
           message appears as the printer's status whenever a user checks the
           printer's queue with lpq(1) or status with lpc status.

   enable printer-name

           Enable the queue for a printer. Users can submit jobs but the
           printer will not print anything until it is started.

   help command-name

           Print help on the command command-name. With no command-name,
           print a summary of the commands available.

   restart printer-name

           Start the printer. Ordinary users can use this command if some
           extraordinary circumstance hangs LPD, but they cannot start a
           printer stopped with either the stop or down commands. The restart
           command is equivalent to abort followed by start.

   start printer-name

           Start the printer. The printer will print jobs in its queue.

   stop printer-name

           Stop the printer. The printer will finish the current job and will
           not print anything else in its queue. Even though the printer is
           stopped, users can still submit jobs to an enabled queue.

   topq printer-name job-or-username

           Rearrange the queue for printer-name by placing the jobs with the
           listed job numbers or the jobs belonging to username at the top of
           the queue. For this command, you cannot use all as the
           printer-name.

   up printer-name

           Bring a printer up; the opposite of the down command. Equivalent
           to start followed by enable.

   lpc(8) accepts the above commands on the command line. If you do not enter
   any commands, lpc(8) enters an interactive mode, where you can enter
   commands until you type exit, quit, or end-of-file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.6 Alternatives to the Standard Spooler

   If you have been reading straight through this manual, by now you have
   learned just about everything there is to know about the LPD spooling
   system that comes with DragonFly. You can probably appreciate many of its
   shortcomings, which naturally leads to the question: ``What other spooling
   systems are out there (and work with DragonFly)?''

   LPRng

           LPRng, which purportedly means ``LPR: the Next Generation'' is a
           complete rewrite of PLP. Patrick Powell and Justin Mason (the
           principal maintainer of PLP) collaborated to make LPRng. The main
           site for LPRng is http://www.lprng.org/.

   CUPS

           CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing System, provides a portable
           printing layer for UNIX-based operating systems. It has been
           developed by Easy Software Products to promote a standard printing
           solution for all UNIX vendors and users.

           CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) as the basis for
           managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD)
           Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect)
           protocols are also supported with reduced functionality. CUPS adds
           network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description (PPD)
           based printing options to support real-world printing under UNIX.

           The main site for CUPS is http://www.cups.org/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

11.7 Troubleshooting

   After performing the simple test with lptest(1), you might have gotten one
   of the following results instead of the correct printout:

   It worked, after awhile; or, it did not eject a full sheet.

           The printer printed the above, but it sat for awhile and did
           nothing. In fact, you might have needed to press a PRINT REMAINING
           or FORM FEED button on the printer to get any results to appear.

           If this is the case, the printer was probably waiting to see if
           there was any more data for your job before it printed anything.
           To fix this problem, you can have the text filter send a FORM FEED
           character (or whatever is necessary) to the printer. This is
           usually sufficient to have the printer immediately print any text
           remaining in its internal buffer. It is also useful to make sure
           each print job ends on a full sheet, so the next job does not
           start somewhere on the middle of the last page of the previous
           job.

           The following replacement for the shell script
           /usr/local/libexec/if-simple prints a form feed after it sends the
           job to the printer:

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # if-simple - Simple text input filter for lpd
 # Installed in /usr/local/libexec/if-simple
 #
 # Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.
 # Writes a form feed character (\f) after printing job.

 /bin/cat && printf "\f" && exit 0
 exit 2

   It produced the ``staircase effect.''

           You got the following on paper:

 !"#$%&'()*+,-./01234
                 "#$%&'()*+,-./012345
                                  #$%&'()*+,-./0123456

           You have become another victim of the staircase effect, caused by
           conflicting interpretations of what characters should indicate a
           new line. UNIX style operating systems use a single character:
           ASCII code 10, the line feed (LF). MS-DOS, OS/2(R), and others
           uses a pair of characters, ASCII code 10 and ASCII code 13 (the
           carriage return or CR). Many printers use the MS-DOS convention
           for representing new-lines.

           When you print with DragonFly, your text used just the line feed
           character. The printer, upon seeing a line feed character,
           advanced the paper one line, but maintained the same horizontal
           position on the page for the next character to print. That is what
           the carriage return is for: to move the location of the next
           character to print to the left edge of the paper.

           Here is what DragonFly wants your printer to do:

           Printer received CR Printer prints CR      
           Printer received LF Printer prints CR + LF 

           Here are some ways to achieve this:

              * Use the printer's configuration switches or control panel to
                alter its interpretation of these characters. Check your
                printer's manual to find out how to do this.

                  Note: If you boot your system into other operating systems
                  besides DragonFly, you may have to reconfigure the printer
                  to use a an interpretation for CR and LF characters that
                  those other operating systems use. You might prefer one of
                  the other solutions, below.

              * Have DragonFly's serial line driver automatically convert LF
                to CR+LF. Of course, this works with printers on serial ports
                only. To enable this feature, use the ms# capability and set
                the onlcr mode in the /etc/printcap file for the printer.

              * Send an escape code to the printer to have it temporarily
                treat LF characters differently. Consult your printer's
                manual for escape codes that your printer might support. When
                you find the proper escape code, modify the text filter to
                send the code first, then send the print job.

                Here is an example text filter for printers that understand
                the Hewlett-Packard PCL escape codes. This filter makes the
                printer treat LF characters as a LF and CR; then it sends the
                job; then it sends a form feed to eject the last page of the
                job. It should work with nearly all Hewlett Packard printers.

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # hpif - Simple text input filter for lpd for HP-PCL based printers
 # Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hpif
 #
 # Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.
 # Tells printer to treat LF as CR+LF.  Ejects the page when done.

 printf "\033&k2G" && cat && printf "\033&l0H" && exit 0
 exit 2

                Here is an example /etc/printcap from a host called orchid.
                It has a single printer attached to its first parallel port,
                a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si named teak. It is using the
                above script as its text filter:

 #
 #  /etc/printcap for host orchid
 #
 teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/hpif:

   It overprinted each line.

           The printer never advanced a line. All of the lines of text were
           printed on top of each other on one line.

           This problem is the ``opposite'' of the staircase effect,
           described above, and is much rarer. Somewhere, the LF characters
           that DragonFly uses to end a line are being treated as CR
           characters to return the print location to the left edge of the
           paper, but not also down a line.

           Use the printer's configuration switches or control panel to
           enforce the following interpretation of LF and CR characters:

           Printer receives Printer prints 
           CR               CR             
           LF               CR + LF        

   The printer lost characters.

           While printing, the printer did not print a few characters in each
           line. The problem might have gotten worse as the printer ran,
           losing more and more characters.

           The problem is that the printer cannot keep up with the speed at
           which the computer sends data over a serial line (this problem
           should not occur with printers on parallel ports). There are two
           ways to overcome the problem:

              * If the printer supports XON/XOFF flow control, have DragonFly
                use it by specifying the ixon mode in the ms# capability.

              * If the printer supports carrier flow control, specify the
                crtscts mode in the ms# capability. Make sure the cable
                connecting the printer to the computer is correctly wired for
                carrier flow control.

   It printed garbage.

           The printer printed what appeared to be random garbage, but not
           the desired text.

           This is usually another symptom of incorrect communications
           parameters with a serial printer. Double-check the bps rate in the
           br capability, and the parity setting in the ms# capability; make
           sure the printer is using the same settings as specified in the
           /etc/printcap file.

   Nothing happened.

           If nothing happened, the problem is probably within DragonFly and
           not the hardware. Add the log file (lf) capability to the entry
           for the printer you are debugging in the /etc/printcap file. For
           example, here is the entry for rattan, with the lf capability:

 rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
         :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
         :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:\
         :lf=/var/log/rattan.log

           Then, try printing again. Check the log file (in our example,
           /var/log/rattan.log) to see any error messages that might appear.
           Based on the messages you see, try to correct the problem.

           If you do not specify a lf capability, LPD uses /dev/console as a
           default.

12.3 Adding Disks

   Originally contributed by David O'Brien.

   Lets say we want to add a new SCSI disk to a machine that currently only
   has a single drive. First turn off the computer and install the drive in
   the computer following the instructions of the computer, controller, and
   drive manufacturer. Due to the wide variations of procedures to do this,
   the details are beyond the scope of this document.

   Login as user root. After you have installed the drive, inspect
   /var/run/dmesg.boot to ensure the new disk was found. Continuing with our
   example, the newly added drive will be da1 and we want to mount it on /1
   (if you are adding an IDE drive, the device name will be ad1).

   Because DragonFly runs on IBM-PC compatible computers, it must take into
   account the PC BIOS partitions. These are different from the traditional
   BSD partitions. A PC disk has up to four BIOS partition entries. If the
   disk is going to be truly dedicated to DragonFly, you can use the
   dedicated mode. Otherwise, DragonFly will have to live within one of the
   PC BIOS partitions. DragonFly calls the PC BIOS partitions slices so as
   not to confuse them with traditional BSD partitions. You may also use
   slices on a disk that is dedicated to DragonFly, but used in a computer
   that also has another operating system installed. This is to not confuse
   the fdisk utility of the other operating system.

   In the slice case the drive will be added as /dev/da1s1e. This is read as:
   SCSI disk, unit number 1 (second SCSI disk), slice 1 (PC BIOS partition
   1), and e BSD partition. In the dedicated case, the drive will be added
   simply as /dev/da1e.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.3.1 Using Command Line Utilities

    12.3.1.1 Using Slices

   This setup will allow your disk to work correctly with other operating
   systems that might be installed on your computer and will not confuse
   other operating systems' fdisk utilities. It is recommended to use this
   method for new disk installs. Only use dedicated mode if you have a good
   reason to do so!

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/da1 bs=1k count=1
 # fdisk -BI da1 #Initialize your new disk
 # disklabel -B -w -r da1s1 auto #Label it.
 # disklabel -e da1s1 # Edit the disklabel just created and add any partitions.
 # mkdir -p /1
 # newfs /dev/da1s1e # Repeat this for every partition you created.
 # mount /dev/da1s1e /1 # Mount the partition(s)
 # vi /etc/fstab # Add the appropriate entry/entries to your /etc/fstab.

   If you have an IDE disk, substitute ad for da.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    12.3.1.2 Dedicated

   If you will not be sharing the new drive with another operating system,
   you may use the dedicated mode. Remember this mode can confuse Microsoft
   operating systems; however, no damage will be done by them. IBM's OS/2
   however, will ``appropriate'' any partition it finds which it does not
   understand.

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/da1 bs=1k count=1
 # disklabel -Brw da1 auto
 # disklabel -e da1                              # create the `e' partition
 # newfs -d0 /dev/da1e
 # mkdir -p /1
 # vi /etc/fstab                         # add an entry for /dev/da1e
 # mount /1

   An alternate method is:

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/da1 count=2
 # disklabel /dev/da1 | disklabel -BrR da1 /dev/stdin
 # newfs /dev/da1e
 # mkdir -p /1
 # vi /etc/fstab                                 # add an entry for /dev/da1e
 # mount /1

12.4 RAID

  12.4.1 Software RAID

    12.4.1.1 Concatenated Disk Driver (CCD) Configuration

   Original work by Christopher Shumway. Revised by Jim Brown.

   When choosing a mass storage solution the most important factors to
   consider are speed, reliability, and cost. It is rare to have all three in
   balance; normally a fast, reliable mass storage device is expensive, and
   to cut back on cost either speed or reliability must be sacrificed.

   In designing the system described below, cost was chosen as the most
   important factor, followed by speed, then reliability. Data transfer speed
   for this system is ultimately constrained by the network. And while
   reliability is very important, the CCD drive described below serves online
   data that is already fully backed up on CD-R's and can easily be replaced.

   Defining your own requirements is the first step in choosing a mass
   storage solution. If your requirements prefer speed or reliability over
   cost, your solution will differ from the system described in this section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      12.4.1.1.1 Installing the Hardware

   In addition to the IDE system disk, three Western Digital 30GB, 5400 RPM
   IDE disks form the core of the CCD disk described below providing
   approximately 90GB of online storage. Ideally, each IDE disk would have
   its own IDE controller and cable, but to minimize cost, additional IDE
   controllers were not used. Instead the disks were configured with jumpers
   so that each IDE controller has one master, and one slave.

   Upon reboot, the system BIOS was configured to automatically detect the
   disks attached. More importantly, DragonFly detected them on reboot:

 ad0: 19574MB <WDC WD205BA> [39770/16/63] at ata0-master UDMA33
 ad1: 29333MB <WDC WD307AA> [59598/16/63] at ata0-slave UDMA33
 ad2: 29333MB <WDC WD307AA> [59598/16/63] at ata1-master UDMA33
 ad3: 29333MB <WDC WD307AA> [59598/16/63] at ata1-slave UDMA33

     Note: If DragonFly does not detect all the disks, ensure that you have
     jumpered them correctly. Most IDE drives also have a ``Cable Select''
     jumper. This is not the jumper for the master/slave relationship.
     Consult the drive documentation for help in identifying the correct
     jumper.

   Next, consider how to attach them as part of the file system. You should
   research both vinum(8) (Chapter 13) and ccd(4). In this particular
   configuration, ccd(4) was chosen.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      12.4.1.1.2 Setting Up the CCD

   The driver ccd(4) allows you to take several identical disks and
   concatenate them into one logical file system. In order to use ccd(4), you
   need a kernel with ccd(4) support built in. Add this line to your kernel
   configuration file, rebuild, and reinstall the kernel:

 pseudo-device   ccd     4

   The ccd(4) support can also be loaded as a kernel loadable module.

   To set up ccd(4), you must first use disklabel(8) to label the disks:

 disklabel -r -w ad1 auto
 disklabel -r -w ad2 auto
 disklabel -r -w ad3 auto

   This creates a disklabel for ad1c, ad2c and ad3c that spans the entire
   disk.

   The next step is to change the disk label type. You can use disklabel(8)
   to edit the disks:

 disklabel -e ad1
 disklabel -e ad2
 disklabel -e ad3

   This opens up the current disk label on each disk with the editor
   specified by the EDITOR environment variable, typically vi(1).

   An unmodified disk label will look something like this:

 16 partitions:
 #        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
   c: 60074784        0    unused        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)

   Add a new e partition for ccd(4) to use. This can usually be copied from
   the c partition, but the fstype must be 4.2BSD. The disk label should now
   look something like this:

 16 partitions:
 #        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
   c: 60074784        0    unused        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)
   e: 60074784        0    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      12.4.1.1.3 Building the File System

   The device node for ccd0c may not exist yet, so to create it, perform the
   following commands:

 cd /dev
 sh MAKEDEV ccd0

   Now that you have all of the disks labeled, you must build the ccd(4). To
   do that, use ccdconfig(8), with options similar to the following:

 ccdconfig ccd0(1) 32(2) 0(3) /dev/ad1e(4) /dev/ad2e /dev/ad3e

   The use and meaning of each option is shown below:

   (1)
           The first argument is the device to configure, in this case,
           /dev/ccd0c. The /dev/ portion is optional.
   (2)
           The interleave for the file system. The interleave defines the
           size of a stripe in disk blocks, each normally 512 bytes. So, an
           interleave of 32 would be 16,384 bytes.
   (3)
           Flags for ccdconfig(8). If you want to enable drive mirroring, you
           can specify a flag here. This configuration does not provide
           mirroring for ccd(4), so it is set at 0 (zero).
   (4)
           The final arguments to ccdconfig(8) are the devices to place into
           the array. Use the complete pathname for each device.

   After running ccdconfig(8) the ccd(4) is configured. A file system can be
   installed. Refer to newfs(8) for options, or simply run:

 newfs /dev/ccd0c

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      12.4.1.1.4 Making it All Automatic

   Generally, you will want to mount the ccd(4) upon each reboot. To do this,
   you must configure it first. Write out your current configuration to
   /etc/ccd.conf using the following command:

 ccdconfig -g > /etc/ccd.conf

   During reboot, the script /etc/rc runs ccdconfig -C if /etc/ccd.conf
   exists. This automatically configures the ccd(4) so it can be mounted.

     Note: If you are booting into single user mode, before you can mount(8)
     the ccd(4), you need to issue the following command to configure the
     array:

 ccdconfig -C

   To automatically mount the ccd(4), place an entry for the ccd(4) in
   /etc/fstab so it will be mounted at boot time:

 /dev/ccd0c              /media       ufs     rw      2       2

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    12.4.1.2 The Vinum Volume Manager

   The Vinum Volume Manager is a block device driver which implements virtual
   disk drives. It isolates disk hardware from the block device interface and
   maps data in ways which result in an increase in flexibility, performance
   and reliability compared to the traditional slice view of disk storage.
   vinum(8) implements the RAID-0, RAID-1 and RAID-5 models, both
   individually and in combination.

   See Chapter 13 for more information about vinum(8).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.4.2 Hardware RAID

   DragonFly also supports a variety of hardware RAID controllers. These
   devices control a RAID subsystem without the need for DragonFly specific
   software to manage the array.

   Using an on-card BIOS, the card controls most of the disk operations
   itself. The following is a brief setup description using a Promise IDE
   RAID controller. When this card is installed and the system is started up,
   it displays a prompt requesting information. Follow the instructions to
   enter the card's setup screen. From here, you have the ability to combine
   all the attached drives. After doing so, the disk(s) will look like a
   single drive to DragonFly. Other RAID levels can be set up accordingly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.4.3 Rebuilding ATA RAID1 Arrays

   DragonFly allows you to hot-replace a failed disk in an array. This
   requires that you catch it before you reboot.

   You will probably see something like the following in /var/log/messages or
   in the dmesg(8) output:

 ad6 on monster1 suffered a hard error.
 ad6: READ command timeout tag=0 serv=0 - resetting
 ad6: trying fallback to PIO mode
 ata3: resetting devices .. done
 ad6: hard error reading fsbn 1116119 of 0-7 (ad6 bn 1116119; cn 1107 tn 4 sn 11) status=59 error=40
 ar0: WARNING - mirror lost

   Using atacontrol(8), check for further information:

 # atacontrol list
 ATA channel 0:
         Master:      no device present
         Slave:   acd0 <HL-DT-ST CD-ROM GCR-8520B/1.00> ATA/ATAPI rev 0

 ATA channel 1:
         Master:      no device present
         Slave:       no device present

 ATA channel 2:
         Master:  ad4 <MAXTOR 6L080J4/A93.0500> ATA/ATAPI rev 5
         Slave:       no device present

 ATA channel 3:
         Master:  ad6 <MAXTOR 6L080J4/A93.0500> ATA/ATAPI rev 5
         Slave:       no device present

 # atacontrol status ar0
 ar0: ATA RAID1 subdisks: ad4 ad6 status: DEGRADED

    1. You will first need to detach the disk from the array so that you can
       safely remove it:

 # atacontrol detach 3

    2. Replace the disk.

    3. Reattach the disk as a spare:

 # atacontrol attach 3
 Master:  ad6 <MAXTOR 6L080J4/A93.0500> ATA/ATAPI rev 5
 Slave:   no device present

    4. Rebuild the array:

 # atacontrol rebuild ar0

    5. The rebuild command hangs until complete. However, it is possible to
       open another terminal (using Alt+Fn) and check on the progress by
       issuing the following command:

 # dmesg | tail -10
 [output removed]
 ad6: removed from configuration
 ad6: deleted from ar0 disk1
 ad6: inserted into ar0 disk1 as spare

 # atacontrol status ar0
 ar0: ATA RAID1 subdisks: ad4 ad6 status: REBUILDING 0% completed

    6. Wait until this operation completes.

12.5 Creating and Using Optical Media (CDs)

   Contributed by Mike Meyer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.1 Introduction

   CDs have a number of features that differentiate them from conventional
   disks. Initially, they were not writable by the user. They are designed so
   that they can be read continuously without delays to move the head between
   tracks. They are also much easier to transport between systems than
   similarly sized media were at the time.

   CDs do have tracks, but this refers to a section of data to be read
   continuously and not a physical property of the disk. To produce a CD on
   DragonFly, you prepare the data files that are going to make up the tracks
   on the CD, then write the tracks to the CD.

   The ISO 9660 file system was designed to deal with these differences. It
   unfortunately codifies file system limits that were common then.
   Fortunately, it provides an extension mechanism that allows properly
   written CDs to exceed those limits while still working with systems that
   do not support those extensions.

   The sysutils/mkisofs program is used to produce a data file containing an
   ISO 9660 file system. It has options that support various extensions, and
   is described below. It is installed by default.

   Which tool to use to burn the CD depends on whether your CD burner is
   ATAPI or something else. ATAPI CD burners use the burncd program that is
   part of the base system. SCSI and USB CD burners should use cdrecord from
   the sysutils/cdrtools port.

   burncd has a limited number of supported drives. To find out if a drive is
   supported, see the CD-R/RW supported drives list.

     Note: It ispossible to use cdrecord and other tools for SCSI drives on
     an ATAPI hardware with the ATAPI/CAM module.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.2 mkisofs

   sysutils/mkisofs produces an ISO 9660 file system that is an image of a
   directory tree in the UNIX file system name space. The simplest usage is:

 # mkisofs -o imagefile.iso /path/to/tree

   This command will create an imagefile.iso containing an ISO 9660 file
   system that is a copy of the tree at /path/to/tree. In the process, it
   will map the file names to names that fit the limitations of the standard
   ISO 9660 file system, and will exclude files that have names
   uncharacteristic of ISO file systems.

   A number of options are available to overcome those restrictions. In
   particular, -R enables the Rock Ridge extensions common to UNIX systems,
   -J enables Joliet extensions used by Microsoft systems, and -hfs can be
   used to create HFS file systems used by Mac OS.

   For CDs that are going to be used only on DragonFly systems, -U can be
   used to disable all filename restrictions. When used with -R, it produces
   a file system image that is identical to the DragonFly tree you started
   from, though it may violate the ISO 9660 standard in a number of ways.

   The last option of general use is -b. This is used to specify the location
   of the boot image for use in producing an ``El Torito'' bootable CD. This
   option takes an argument which is the path to a boot image from the top of
   the tree being written to the CD. So, given that /tmp/myboot holds a
   bootable DragonFly system with the boot image in /tmp/myboot/boot/cdboot,
   you could produce the image of an ISO 9660 file system in
   /tmp/bootable.iso like so:

 # mkisofs -U -R -b boot/cdboot -o /tmp/bootable.iso /tmp/myboot

   Having done that, if you have vn configured in your kernel, you can mount
   the file system with:

 # vnconfig -e vn0c /tmp/bootable.iso
 # mount -t cd9660 /dev/vn0c /mnt

   At which point you can verify that /mnt and /tmp/myboot are identical.

   There are many other options you can use with sysutils/mkisofs to
   fine-tune its behavior. In particular: modifications to an ISO 9660 layout
   and the creation of Joliet and HFS discs. See the mkisofs(8) manual page
   for details.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.3 burncd

   If you have an ATAPI CD burner, you can use the burncd command to burn an
   ISO image onto a CD. burncd is part of the base system, installed as
   /usr/sbin/burncd. Usage is very simple, as it has few options:

 # burncd -f cddevice data imagefile.iso fixate

   Will burn a copy of imagefile.iso on cddevice. The default device is
   /dev/acd0c. See burncd(8) for options to set the write speed, eject the CD
   after burning, and write audio data.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.4 cdrecord

   If you do not have an ATAPI CD burner, you will have to use cdrecord to
   burn your CDs. cdrecord is not part of the base system; you must install
   it from either the port at sysutils/cdrtools or the appropriate package.
   Changes to the base system can cause binary versions of this program to
   fail, possibly resulting in a ``coaster''. You should therefore either
   upgrade the port when you upgrade your system.

   While cdrecord has many options, basic usage is even simpler than burncd.
   Burning an ISO 9660 image is done with:

 # cdrecord dev=device imagefile.iso

   The tricky part of using cdrecord is finding the dev to use. To find the
   proper setting, use the -scanbus flag of cdrecord, which might produce
   results like this:

 # cdrecord -scanbus

   This lists the appropriate dev value for the devices on the list. Locate
   your CD burner, and use the three numbers separated by commas as the value
   for dev. In this case, the CRW device is 1,5,0, so the appropriate input
   would be dev=1,5,0. There are easier ways to specify this value; see
   cdrecord(1) for details. That is also the place to look for information on
   writing audio tracks, controlling the speed, and other things.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.5 Duplicating Audio CDs

   You can duplicate an audio CD by extracting the audio data from the CD to
   a series of files, and then writing these files to a blank CD. The process
   is slightly different for ATAPI and SCSI drives.

   SCSI Drives

    1. Use cdda2wav to extract the audio.

 % cdda2wav -v255 -D2,0 -B -Owav

    2. Use cdrecord to write the .wav files.

 % cdrecord -v dev=2,0 -dao -useinfo  *.wav

       Make sure that 2.0 is set appropriately, as described in Section
       12.5.4.

   ATAPI Drives

    1. The ATAPI CD driver makes each track available as /dev/acddtnn, where
       d is the drive number, and nn is the track number written with two
       decimal digits, prefixed with zero as needed. So the first track on
       the first disk is /dev/acd0t01, the second is /dev/acd0t02, the third
       is /dev/acd0t03, and so on.

       Make sure the appropriate files exist in /dev.

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV acd0t99

    2. Extract each track using dd(1). You must also use a specific block
       size when extracting the files.

 # dd if=/dev/acd0t01 of=track1.cdr bs=2352
 # dd if=/dev/acd0t02 of=track2.cdr bs=2352
 ...

    3. Burn the extracted files to disk using burncd. You must specify that
       these are audio files, and that burncd should fixate the disk when
       finished.

 # burncd -f /dev/acd0c audio track1.cdr track2.cdr ... fixate

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.6 Duplicating Data CDs

   You can copy a data CD to a image file that is functionally equivalent to
   the image file created with sysutils/mkisofs, and you can use it to
   duplicate any data CD. The example given here assumes that your CDROM
   device is acd0c. Substitute your correct CDROM device. A c must be
   appended to the end of the device name to indicate the entire partition
   or, in the case of CDROMs, the entire disc.

 # dd if=/dev/acd0c of=file.iso bs=2048

   Now that you have an image, you can burn it to CD as described above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.7 Using Data CDs

   Now that you have created a standard data CDROM, you probably want to
   mount it and read the data on it. By default, mount(8) assumes that a file
   system is of type ufs. If you try something like:

 # mount /dev/cd0 /mnt

   you will get a complaint about ``Incorrect super block'', and no mount.
   The CDROM is not a UFS file system, so attempts to mount it as such will
   fail. You just need to tell mount(8) that the file system is of type
   ISO9660, and everything will work. You do this by specifying the -t cd9660
   option mount(8). For example, if you want to mount the CDROM device,
   /dev/cd0, under /mnt, you would execute:

 # mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt

   Note that your device name (/dev/cd0 in this example) could be different,
   depending on the interface your CDROM uses. Also, the -t cd9660 option
   just executes mount_cd9660(8). The above example could be shortened to:

 # mount_cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt

   You can generally use data CDROMs from any vendor in this way. Disks with
   certain ISO 9660 extensions might behave oddly, however. For example,
   Joliet disks store all filenames in two-byte Unicode characters. The
   DragonFly kernel does not speak Unicode (yet!), so non-English characters
   show up as question marks. (The CD9660 driver includes hooks to load an
   appropriate Unicode conversion table on the fly. Modules for some of the
   common encodings are available via the sysutils/cd9660_unicode port.)

   Occasionally, you might get ``Device not configured'' when trying to mount
   a CDROM. This usually means that the CDROM drive thinks that there is no
   disk in the tray, or that the drive is not visible on the bus. It can take
   a couple of seconds for a CDROM drive to realize that it has been fed, so
   be patient.

   Sometimes, a SCSI CDROM may be missed because it did not have enough time
   to answer the bus reset. If you have a SCSI CDROM please add the following
   option to your kernel configuration and rebuild your kernel.

 options SCSI_DELAY=15000

   This tells your SCSI bus to pause 15 seconds during boot, to give your
   CDROM drive every possible chance to answer the bus reset.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.8 Burning Raw Data CDs

   You can choose to burn a file directly to CD, without creating an ISO 9660
   file system. Some people do this for backup purposes. This runs more
   quickly than burning a standard CD:

 # burncd -f /dev/acd1 -s 12 data archive.tar.gz fixate

   In order to retrieve the data burned to such a CD, you must read data from
   the raw device node:

 # tar xzvf /dev/acd1

   You cannot mount this disk as you would a normal CDROM. Such a CDROM
   cannot be read under any operating system except DragonFly. If you want to
   be able to mount the CD, or share data with another operating system, you
   must use sysutils/mkisofs as described above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.5.9 Using the ATAPI/CAM Driver

   Contributed by Marc Fonvieille.

   This driver allows ATAPI devices (CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD drives etc...) to be
   accessed through the SCSI subsystem, and so allows the use of applications
   like sysutils/cdrdao or cdrecord(1).

   To use this driver, you will need to add the following lines to your
   kernel configuration file:

 device atapicam
 device scbus
 device cd
 device pass

   You also need the following line in your kernel configuration file:

 device ata

   which should already be present.

   Then rebuild, install your new kernel, and reboot your machine. During the
   boot process, your burner should show up, like so:

 acd0: CD-RW <MATSHITA CD-RW/DVD-ROM UJDA740> at ata1-master PIO4
 cd0 at ata1 bus 0 target 0 lun 0
 cd0: <MATSHITA CDRW/DVD UJDA740 1.00> Removable CD-ROM SCSI-0 device
 cd0: 16.000MB/s transfers
 cd0: Attempt to query device size failed: NOT READY, Medium not present - tray closed

   The drive could now be accessed via the /dev/cd0 device name, for example
   to mount a CD-ROM on /mnt, just type the following:

 # mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt

   As root, you can run the following command to get the SCSI address of the
   burner:

 # camcontrol devlist
 <MATSHITA CDRW/DVD UJDA740 1.00>   at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (pass0,cd0)

   So 1,0,0 will be the SCSI address to use with cdrecord(1) and other SCSI
   application.

   For more information about ATAPI/CAM and SCSI system, refer to the
   atapicam(4) and cam(4) manual pages.

12.6 Creating and Using Optical Media (DVDs)

   Contributed by Marc Fonvieille. With inputs from Andy Polyakov.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.1 Introduction

   Compared to the CD, the DVD is the next generation of optical media
   storage technology. The DVD can hold more data than any CD and is nowadays
   the standard for video publishing.

   Five physical recordable formats can be defined for what we will call a
   recordable DVD:

     * DVD-R: This was the first DVD recordable format available. The DVD-R
       standard is defined by the DVD Forum. This format is write once.

     * DVD-RW: This is the rewriteable version of the DVD-R standard. A
       DVD-RW can be rewritten about 1000 times.

     * DVD-RAM: This is also a rewriteable format supported by the DVD Forum.
       A DVD-RAM can be seen as a removable hard drive. However, this media
       is not compatible with most DVD-ROM drives and DVD-Video players; only
       a few DVD writers support the DVD-RAM format.

     * DVD+RW: This is a rewriteable format defined by the DVD+RW Alliance. A
       DVD+RW can be rewritten about 1000 times.

     * DVD+R: This format is the write once variation of the DVD+RW format.

   A single layer recordable DVD can hold up to 4,700,000,000 bytes which is
   actually 4.38 GB or 4485 MB (1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes).

     Note: A distinction must be made between the physical media and the
     application. For example, a DVD-Video is a specific file layout that can
     be written on any recordable DVD physical media: DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW
     etc. Before choosing the type of media, you must be sure that both the
     burner and the DVD-Video player (a standalone player or a DVD-ROM drive
     on a computer) are compatible with the media under consideration.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.2 Configuration

   The program growisofs(1) will be used to perform DVD recording. This
   command is part of the dvd+rw-tools utilities (sysutils/dvd+rw-tools). The
   dvd+rw-tools support all DVD media types.

   These tools use the SCSI subsystem to access to the devices, therefore the
   ATAPI/CAM support must be added to your kernel.

   You also have to enable DMA access for ATAPI devices, this can be done in
   adding the following line to the /boot/loader.conf file:

 hw.ata.atapi_dma="1"

   Before attempting to use the dvd+rw-tools you should consult the
   dvd+rw-tools' hardware compatibility notes for any information related to
   your DVD burner.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.3 Burning Data DVDs

   The growisofs(1) command is a frontend to mkisofs, it will invoke
   mkisofs(8) to create the file system layout and will perform the write on
   the DVD. This means you do not need to create an image of the data before
   the burning process.

   To burn onto a DVD+R or a DVD-R the data from the /path/to/data directory,
   use the following command:

 # growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/cd0 -J -R /path/to/data

   The options -J -R are passed to mkisofs(8) for the file system creation
   (in this case: an ISO 9660 file system with Joliet and Rock Ridge
   extensions), consult the mkisofs(8) manual page for more details.

   The option -Z is used for the initial session recording in any case:
   multiple sessions or not. The DVD device, /dev/cd0, must be changed
   according to your configuration. The -dvd-compat parameter will close the
   disk, the recording will be unappendable. In return this should provide
   better media compatibility with DVD-ROM drives.

   It is also possible to burn a pre-mastered image, for example to burn the
   image imagefile.iso, we will run:

 # growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/cd0=imagefile.iso

   The write speed should be detected and automatically set according to the
   media and the drive being used. If you want to force the write speed, use
   the -speed= parameter. For more information, read the growisofs(1) manual
   page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.4 Burning a DVD-Video

   A DVD-Video is a specific file layout based on ISO 9660 and the micro-UDF
   (M-UDF) specifications. The DVD-Video also presents a specific data
   structure hierarchy, it is the reason why you need a particular program
   such as multimedia/dvdauthor to author the DVD.

   If you already have an image of the DVD-Video file system, just burn it in
   the same way as for any image, see the previous section for an example. If
   you have made the DVD authoring and the result is in, for example, the
   directory /path/to/video, the following command should be used to burn the
   DVD-Video:

 # growisofs -Z /dev/cd0 -dvd-video /path/to/video

   The -dvd-video option will be passed down to mkisofs(8) and will instruct
   it to create a DVD-Video file system layout. Beside this, the -dvd-video
   option implies -dvd-compat growisofs(1) option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.5 Using a DVD+RW

   Unlike CD-RW, a virgin DVD+RW needs to be formatted before first use. The
   growisofs(1) program will take care of it automatically whenever
   appropriate, which is the recommended way. However you can use the
   dvd+rw-format command to format the DVD+RW:

 # dvd+rw-format /dev/cd0

   You need to perform this operation just once, keep in mind that only
   virgin DVD+RW medias need to be formatted. Then you can burn the DVD+RW in
   the way seen in previous sections.

   If you want to burn new data (burn a totally new file system not append
   some data) onto a DVD+RW, you do not need to blank it, you just have to
   write over the previous recording (in performing a new initial session),
   like this:

 # growisofs -Z /dev/cd0 -J -R /path/to/newdata

   DVD+RW format offers the possibility to easily append data to a previous
   recording. The operation consists in merging a new session to the existing
   one, it is not multisession writing, growisofs(1) will grow the ISO 9660
   file system present on the media.

   For example, if we want to append data to our previous DVD+RW, we have to
   use the following:

 # growisofs -M /dev/cd0 -J -R /path/to/nextdata

   The same mkisofs(8) options we used to burn the initial session should be
   used during next writes.

     Note: You may want to use the -dvd-compat option if you want better
     media compatibility with DVD-ROM drives. In the DVD+RW case, this will
     not prevent you from adding data.

   If for any reason you really want to blank the media, do the following:

 # growisofs -Z /dev/cd0=/dev/zero

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.6 Using a DVD-RW

   A DVD-RW accepts two disc formats: the incremental sequential one and the
   restricted overwrite. By default DVD-RW discs are in sequential format.

   A virgin DVD-RW can be directly written without the need of a formatting
   operation, however a non-virgin DVD-RW in sequential format needs to be
   blanked before to be able to write a new initial session.

   To blank a DVD-RW in sequential mode, run:

 # dvd+rw-format -blank=full /dev/cd0

     Note: A full blanking (-blank=full) will take about one hour on a 1x
     media. A fast blanking can be performed using the -blank option if the
     DVD-RW will be recorded in Disk-At-Once (DAO) mode. To burn the DVD-RW
     in DAO mode, use the command:

 # growisofs -use-the-force-luke=dao -Z /dev/cd0=imagefile.iso

     The -use-the-force-luke=dao option should not be required since
     growisofs(1) attempts to detect minimally (fast blanked) media and
     engage DAO write.

     In fact one should use restricted overwrite mode with any DVD-RW, this
     format is more flexible than the default incremental sequential one.

   To write data on a sequential DVD-RW, use the same instructions as for the
   other DVD formats:

 # growisofs -Z /dev/cd0 -J -R /path/to/data

   If you want to append some data to your previous recording, you will have
   to use the growisofs(1) -M option. However, if you perform data addition
   on a DVD-RW in incremental sequential mode, a new session will be created
   on the disc and the result will be a multi-session disc.

   A DVD-RW in restricted overwrite format does not need to be blanked before
   a new initial session, you just have to overwrite the disc with the -Z
   option, this is similar to the DVD+RW case. It is also possible to grow an
   existing ISO 9660 file system written on the disc in a same way as for a
   DVD+RW with the -M option. The result will be a one-session DVD.

   To put a DVD-RW in the restricted overwrite format, the following command
   must be used:

 # dvd+rw-format /dev/cd0

   To change back to the sequential format use:

 # dvd+rw-format -blank=full /dev/cd0

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.7 Multisession

   Very few DVD-ROM and DVD-Video players support multisession DVDs, they
   will most of time, hopefully, only read the first session. DVD+R, DVD-R
   and DVD-RW in sequential format can accept multiple sessions, the notion
   of multiple sessions does not exist for the DVD+RW and the DVD-RW
   restricted overwrite formats.

   Using the following command after an initial (non-closed) session on a
   DVD+R, DVD-R, or DVD-RW in sequential format, will add a new session to
   the disc:

 # growisofs -M /dev/cd0 -J -R /path/to/nextdata

   Using this command line with a DVD+RW or a DVD-RW in restricted overwrite
   mode, will append data in merging the new session to the existing one. The
   result will be a single-session disc. This is the way used to add data
   after an initial write on these medias.

     Note: Some space on the media is used between each session for end and
     start of sessions. Therefore, one should add sessions with large amount
     of data to optimize media space. The number of sessions is limited to
     154 for a DVD+R and about 2000 for a DVD-R.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.6.8 For More Information

   To obtain more information about a DVD, the dvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/cd0
   command can be ran with the disc in the drive.

   More information about the dvd+rw-tools can be found in the growisofs(1)
   manual page, on the dvd+rw-tools web site and in the cdwrite mailing list
   archives.

     Note: The dvd+rw-mediainfo output of the resulting recording or the
     media with issues is mandatory for any problem report. Without this
     output, it will be quite impossible to help you.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.7 Creating and Using Floppy Disks

   Original work by Julio Merino. Rewritten by Martin Karlsson.

   Storing data on floppy disks is sometimes useful, for example when one
   does not have any other removable storage media or when one needs to
   transfer small amounts of data to another computer.

   This section will explain how to use floppy disks in DragonFly. It will
   primarily cover formatting and usage of 3.5inch DOS floppies, but the
   concepts are similar for other floppy disk formats.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.7.1 Formatting Floppies

    12.7.1.1 The Device

   Floppy disks are accessed through entries in /dev, just like other
   devices. To access the raw floppy disk, one uses /dev/fdN, where N stands
   for the drive number, usually 0, or /dev/fdNX, where X stands for a
   letter.

   There are also /dev/fdN.size devices, where size is a floppy disk size in
   kilobytes. These entries are used at low-level format time to determine
   the disk size. 1440kB is the size that will be used in the following
   examples.

   Sometimes the entries under /dev will have to be (re)created. To do that,
   issue:

 # cd /dev && ./MAKEDEV "fd*"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    12.7.1.2 Formatting

   A floppy disk needs to be low-level formated before it can be used. This
   is usually done by the vendor, but formatting is a good way to check media
   integrity. Although it is possible to force larger (or smaller) disk
   sizes, 1440kB is what most floppy disks are designed for.

   To low-level format the floppy disk you need to use fdformat(1). This
   utility expects the device name as an argument.

   Make note of any error messages, as these can help determine if the disk
   is good or bad.

   Use the /dev/fdN.size devices to format the floppy. Insert a new 3.5inch
   floppy disk in your drive and issue:

 # /usr/sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0.1440

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.7.2 The Disk Label

   After low-level formatting the disk, you will need to place a disk label
   on it. This disk label will be destroyed later, but it is needed by the
   system to determine the size of the disk and its geometry later.

   The new disk label will take over the whole disk, and will contain all the
   proper information about the geometry of the floppy. The geometry values
   for the disk label are listed in /etc/disktab.

   You can run now disklabel(8) like so:

 # /sbin/disklabel -B -r -w /dev/fd0 fd1440

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.7.3 The File System

   Now the floppy is ready to be high-level formated. This will place a new
   file system on it, which will let DragonFly read and write to the disk.
   After creating the new file system, the disk label is destroyed, so if you
   want to reformat the disk, you will have to recreate the disk label.

   The floppy's file system can be either UFS or FAT. FAT is generally a
   better choice for floppies.

   To put a new file system on the floppy, issue:

 # /sbin/newfs_msdos /dev/fd0

   The disk is now ready for use.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.7.4 Using the Floppy

   To use the floppy, mount it with mount_msdos(8). One can also use
   sysutils/mtools from pkgsrc.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.8 Creating and Using Data Tapes

   The major tape media are the 4mm, 8mm, QIC, mini-cartridge and DLT.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.1 4mm (DDS: Digital Data Storage)

   4mm tapes are replacing QIC as the workstation backup media of choice.
   This trend accelerated greatly when Conner purchased Archive, a leading
   manufacturer of QIC drives, and then stopped production of QIC drives. 4mm
   drives are small and quiet but do not have the reputation for reliability
   that is enjoyed by 8mm drives. The cartridges are less expensive and
   smaller (3 x 2 x 0.5 inches, 76 x 51 x 12 mm) than 8mm cartridges. 4mm,
   like 8mm, has comparatively short head life for the same reason, both use
   helical scan.

   Data throughput on these drives starts ~150 kB/s, peaking at ~500 kB/s.
   Data capacity starts at 1.3 GB and ends at 2.0 GB. Hardware compression,
   available with most of these drives, approximately doubles the capacity.
   Multi-drive tape library units can have 6 drives in a single cabinet with
   automatic tape changing. Library capacities reach 240 GB.

   The DDS-3 standard now supports tape capacities up to 12 GB (or 24 GB
   compressed).

   4mm drives, like 8mm drives, use helical-scan. All the benefits and
   drawbacks of helical-scan apply to both 4mm and 8mm drives.

   Tapes should be retired from use after 2,000 passes or 100 full backups.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.2 8mm (Exabyte)

   8mm tapes are the most common SCSI tape drives; they are the best choice
   of exchanging tapes. Nearly every site has an Exabyte 2 GB 8mm tape drive.
   8mm drives are reliable, convenient and quiet. Cartridges are inexpensive
   and small (4.8 x 3.3 x 0.6 inches; 122 x 84 x 15 mm). One downside of 8mm
   tape is relatively short head and tape life due to the high rate of
   relative motion of the tape across the heads.

   Data throughput ranges from ~250 kB/s to ~500 kB/s. Data sizes start at
   300 MB and go up to 7 GB. Hardware compression, available with most of
   these drives, approximately doubles the capacity. These drives are
   available as single units or multi-drive tape libraries with 6 drives and
   120 tapes in a single cabinet. Tapes are changed automatically by the
   unit. Library capacities reach 840+ GB.

   The Exabyte ``Mammoth'' model supports 12 GB on one tape (24 GB with
   compression) and costs approximately twice as much as conventional tape
   drives.

   Data is recorded onto the tape using helical-scan, the heads are
   positioned at an angle to the media (approximately 6 degrees). The tape
   wraps around 270 degrees of the spool that holds the heads. The spool
   spins while the tape slides over the spool. The result is a high density
   of data and closely packed tracks that angle across the tape from one edge
   to the other.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.3 QIC

   QIC-150 tapes and drives are, perhaps, the most common tape drive and
   media around. QIC tape drives are the least expensive ``serious'' backup
   drives. The downside is the cost of media. QIC tapes are expensive
   compared to 8mm or 4mm tapes, up to 5 times the price per GB data storage.
   But, if your needs can be satisfied with a half-dozen tapes, QIC may be
   the correct choice. QIC is the most common tape drive. Every site has a
   QIC drive of some density or another. Therein lies the rub, QIC has a
   large number of densities on physically similar (sometimes identical)
   tapes. QIC drives are not quiet. These drives audibly seek before they
   begin to record data and are clearly audible whenever reading, writing or
   seeking. QIC tapes measure (6 x 4 x 0.7 inches; 15.2 x 10.2 x 1.7 mm).
   Mini-cartridges, which also use 1/4" wide tape are discussed separately.
   Tape libraries and changers are not available.

   Data throughput ranges from ~150 kB/s to ~500 kB/s. Data capacity ranges
   from 40 MB to 15 GB. Hardware compression is available on many of the
   newer QIC drives. QIC drives are less frequently installed; they are being
   supplanted by DAT drives.

   Data is recorded onto the tape in tracks. The tracks run along the long
   axis of the tape media from one end to the other. The number of tracks,
   and therefore the width of a track, varies with the tape's capacity. Most
   if not all newer drives provide backward-compatibility at least for
   reading (but often also for writing). QIC has a good reputation regarding
   the safety of the data (the mechanics are simpler and more robust than for
   helical scan drives).

   Tapes should be retired from use after 5,000 backups.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.4 XXX* Mini-Cartridge

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.5 DLT

   DLT has the fastest data transfer rate of all the drive types listed here.
   The 1/2" (12.5mm) tape is contained in a single spool cartridge (4 x 4 x 1
   inches; 100 x 100 x 25 mm). The cartridge has a swinging gate along one
   entire side of the cartridge. The drive mechanism opens this gate to
   extract the tape leader. The tape leader has an oval hole in it which the
   drive uses to ``hook'' the tape. The take-up spool is located inside the
   tape drive. All the other tape cartridges listed here (9 track tapes are
   the only exception) have both the supply and take-up spools located inside
   the tape cartridge itself.

   Data throughput is approximately 1.5 MB/s, three times the throughput of
   4mm, 8mm, or QIC tape drives. Data capacities range from 10 GB to 20 GB
   for a single drive. Drives are available in both multi-tape changers and
   multi-tape, multi-drive tape libraries containing from 5 to 900 tapes over
   1 to 20 drives, providing from 50 GB to 9 TB of storage.

   With compression, DLT Type IV format supports up to 70 GB capacity.

   Data is recorded onto the tape in tracks parallel to the direction of
   travel (just like QIC tapes). Two tracks are written at once. Read/write
   head lifetimes are relatively long; once the tape stops moving, there is
   no relative motion between the heads and the tape.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.6 AIT

   AIT is a new format from Sony, and can hold up to 50 GB (with compression)
   per tape. The tapes contain memory chips which retain an index of the
   tape's contents. This index can be rapidly read by the tape drive to
   determine the position of files on the tape, instead of the several
   minutes that would be required for other tapes. Software such as
   SAMS:Alexandria can operate forty or more AIT tape libraries,
   communicating directly with the tape's memory chip to display the contents
   on screen, determine what files were backed up to which tape, locate the
   correct tape, load it, and restore the data from the tape.

   Libraries like this cost in the region of $20,000, pricing them a little
   out of the hobbyist market.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.8.7 Using a New Tape for the First Time

   The first time that you try to read or write a new, completely blank tape,
   the operation will fail. The console messages should be similar to:

 sa0(ncr1:4:0): NOT READY asc:4,1
 sa0(ncr1:4:0):  Logical unit is in process of becoming ready

   The tape does not contain an Identifier Block (block number 0). All QIC
   tape drives since the adoption of QIC-525 standard write an Identifier
   Block to the tape. There are two solutions:

     * mt fsf 1 causes the tape drive to write an Identifier Block to the
       tape.

     * Use the front panel button to eject the tape.

       Re-insert the tape and dump data to the tape.

       dump will report ``DUMP: End of tape detected'' and the console will
       show: ``HARDWARE FAILURE info:280 asc:80,96''.

       rewind the tape using: mt rewind.

       Subsequent tape operations are successful.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.9 Backups to Floppies

  12.9.1 Can I Use Floppies for Backing Up My Data?

   Floppy disks are not really a suitable media for making backups as:

     * The media is unreliable, especially over long periods of time.

     * Backing up and restoring is very slow.

     * They have a very limited capacity (the days of backing up an entire
       hard disk onto a dozen or so floppies has long since passed).

   However, if you have no other method of backing up your data then floppy
   disks are better than no backup at all.

   If you do have to use floppy disks then ensure that you use good quality
   ones. Floppies that have been lying around the office for a couple of
   years are a bad choice. Ideally use new ones from a reputable
   manufacturer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.9.2 So How Do I Backup My Data to Floppies?

   The best way to backup to floppy disk is to use tar(1) with the -M (multi
   volume) option, which allows backups to span multiple floppies.

   To backup all the files in the current directory and sub-directory use
   this (as root):

 # tar Mcvf /dev/fd0 *

   When the first floppy is full tar(1) will prompt you to insert the next
   volume (because tar(1) is media independent it refers to volumes; in this
   context it means floppy disk).

 Prepare volume #2 for /dev/fd0 and hit return:

   This is repeated (with the volume number incrementing) until all the
   specified files have been archived.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.9.3 Can I Compress My Backups?

   Unfortunately, tar(1) will not allow the -z option to be used for
   multi-volume archives. You could, of course, gzip(1) all the files, tar(1)
   them to the floppies, then gunzip(1) the files again!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.9.4 How Do I Restore My Backups?

   To restore the entire archive use:

 # tar Mxvf /dev/fd0

   There are two ways that you can use to restore only specific files. First,
   you can start with the first floppy and use:

 # tar Mxvf /dev/fd0 filename

   The utility tar(1) will prompt you to insert subsequent floppies until it
   finds the required file.

   Alternatively, if you know which floppy the file is on then you can simply
   insert that floppy and use the same command as above. Note that if the
   first file on the floppy is a continuation from the previous one then
   tar(1) will warn you that it cannot restore it, even if you have not asked
   it to!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.10 Backup Basics

   The three major backup programs are dump(8), tar(1), and cpio(1).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.1 Dump and Restore

   The traditional UNIX backup programs are dump and restore. They operate on
   the drive as a collection of disk blocks, below the abstractions of files,
   links and directories that are created by the file systems. dump backs up
   an entire file system on a device. It is unable to backup only part of a
   file system or a directory tree that spans more than one file system. dump
   does not write files and directories to tape, but rather writes the raw
   data blocks that comprise files and directories.

     Note: If you use dump on your root directory, you would not back up
     /home, /usr or many other directories since these are typically mount
     points for other file systems or symbolic links into those file systems.

   dump has quirks that remain from its early days in Version 6 of AT&T UNIX
   (circa 1975). The default parameters are suitable for 9-track tapes (6250
   bpi), not the high-density media available today (up to 62,182 ftpi).
   These defaults must be overridden on the command line to utilize the
   capacity of current tape drives.

   It is also possible to backup data across the network to a tape drive
   attached to another computer with rdump and rrestore. Both programs rely
   upon rcmd and ruserok to access the remote tape drive. Therefore, the user
   performing the backup must be listed in the .rhosts file on the remote
   computer. The arguments to rdump and rrestore must be suitable to use on
   the remote computer. When rdumping from a DragonFly computer to an Exabyte
   tape drive connected to a Sun called komodo, use:

 # /sbin/rdump 0dsbfu 54000 13000 126 komodo:/dev/nsa8 /dev/da0a 2>&1

   Beware: there are security implications to allowing .rhosts
   authentication. Evaluate your situation carefully.

   It is also possible to use dump and restore in a more secure fashion over
   ssh.

   Example 12-1. Using dump over ssh

 # /sbin/dump -0uan -f - /usr | gzip -2 | ssh1 -c blowfish \
           targetuser@targetmachine.example.com dd of=/mybigfiles/dump-usr-l0.gz

   Or using dump's built-in method, setting the enviroment variable RSH:

   Example 12-2. Using dump over ssh with RSH set

 # RSH=/usr/bin/ssh /sbin/dump -0uan -f targetuser@targetmachine.example.com:/dev/sa0

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.2 tar

   tar(1) also dates back to Version 6 of AT&T UNIX (circa 1975). tar
   operates in cooperation with the file system; tar writes files and
   directories to tape. tar does not support the full range of options that
   are available from cpio(1), but tar does not require the unusual command
   pipeline that cpio uses.

   Most versions of tar do not support backups across the network. The GNU
   version of tar, which DragonFly utilizes, supports remote devices using
   the same syntax as rdump. To tar to an Exabyte tape drive connected to a
   Sun called komodo, use:

 # /usr/bin/tar cf komodo:/dev/nsa8 . 2>&1

   For versions without remote device support, you can use a pipeline and rsh
   to send the data to a remote tape drive.

 # tar cf - . | rsh hostname dd of=tape-device obs=20b

   If you are worried about the security of backing up over a network you
   should use the ssh command instead of rsh.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.3 cpio

   cpio(1) is the original UNIX file interchange tape program for magnetic
   media. cpio has options (among many others) to perform byte-swapping,
   write a number of different archive formats, and pipe the data to other
   programs. This last feature makes cpio an excellent choice for
   installation media. cpio does not know how to walk the directory tree and
   a list of files must be provided through stdin.

   cpio does not support backups across the network. You can use a pipeline
   and rsh to send the data to a remote tape drive.

 # for f in directory_list; do
 find $f >> backup.list
 done
 # cpio -v -o --format=newc < backup.list | ssh user@host "cat > backup_device"

   Where directory_list is the list of directories you want to back up,
   user@host is the user/hostname combination that will be performing the
   backups, and backup_device is where the backups should be written to
   (e.g., /dev/nsa0).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.4 pax

   pax(1) is IEEE/POSIX's answer to tar and cpio. Over the years the various
   versions of tar and cpio have gotten slightly incompatible. So rather than
   fight it out to fully standardize them, POSIX created a new archive
   utility. pax attempts to read and write many of the various cpio and tar
   formats, plus new formats of its own. Its command set more resembles cpio
   than tar.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.5 Amanda

   Amanda (Advanced Maryland Network Disk Archiver) is a client/server backup
   system, rather than a single program. An Amanda server will backup to a
   single tape drive any number of computers that have Amanda clients and a
   network connection to the Amanda server. A common problem at sites with a
   number of large disks is that the length of time required to backup to
   data directly to tape exceeds the amount of time available for the task.
   Amanda solves this problem. Amanda can use a ``holding disk'' to backup
   several file systems at the same time. Amanda creates ``archive sets'': a
   group of tapes used over a period of time to create full backups of all
   the file systems listed in Amanda's configuration file. The ``archive
   set'' also contains nightly incremental (or differential) backups of all
   the file systems. Restoring a damaged file system requires the most recent
   full backup and the incremental backups.

   The configuration file provides fine control of backups and the network
   traffic that Amanda generates. Amanda will use any of the above backup
   programs to write the data to tape. Amanda is available as either a port
   or a package, it is not installed by default.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.6 Do Nothing

   ``Do nothing'' is not a computer program, but it is the most widely used
   backup strategy. There are no initial costs. There is no backup schedule
   to follow. Just say no. If something happens to your data, grin and bear
   it!

   If your time and your data is worth little to nothing, then ``Do nothing''
   is the most suitable backup program for your computer. But beware, UNIX is
   a useful tool, you may find that within six months you have a collection
   of files that are valuable to you.

   ``Do nothing'' is the correct backup method for /usr/obj and other
   directory trees that can be exactly recreated by your computer. An example
   is the files that comprise the HTML or PostScript version of this
   Handbook. These document formats have been created from SGML input files.
   Creating backups of the HTML or PostScript files is not necessary. The
   SGML files are backed up regularly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.7 Which Backup Program Is Best?

   dump(8) Period. Elizabeth D. Zwicky torture tested all the backup programs
   discussed here. The clear choice for preserving all your data and all the
   peculiarities of UNIX file systems is dump. Elizabeth created file systems
   containing a large variety of unusual conditions (and some not so unusual
   ones) and tested each program by doing a backup and restore of those file
   systems. The peculiarities included: files with holes, files with holes
   and a block of nulls, files with funny characters in their names,
   unreadable and unwritable files, devices, files that change size during
   the backup, files that are created/deleted during the backup and more. She
   presented the results at LISA V in Oct. 1991. Read the ``Torture-testing
   Backup and Archive Programs'' study for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.10.8 Emergency Restore Procedure

    12.10.8.1 Before the Disaster

   There are only four steps that you need to perform in preparation for any
   disaster that may occur.

   First, print the disklabel from each of your disks (e.g. disklabel da0 |
   lpr), your file system table (/etc/fstab) and all boot messages, two
   copies of each.

   Second, determine that the boot and fix-it floppies (boot.flp and
   fixit.flp) have all your devices. The easiest way to check is to reboot
   your machine with the boot floppy in the floppy drive and check the boot
   messages. If all your devices are listed and functional, skip on to step
   three.

   Otherwise, you have to create two custom bootable floppies which have a
   kernel that can mount all of your disks and access your tape drive. These
   floppies must contain: fdisk, disklabel, newfs, mount, and whichever
   backup program you use. These programs must be statically linked. If you
   use dump, the floppy must contain restore.

   Third, create backup tapes regularly. Any changes that you make after your
   last backup may be irretrievably lost. Write-protect the backup tapes.

   Fourth, test the floppies (either boot.flp and fixit.flp or the two custom
   bootable floppies you made in step two.) and backup tapes. Make notes of
   the procedure. Store these notes with the bootable floppy, the printouts
   and the backup tapes. You will be so distraught when restoring that the
   notes may prevent you from destroying your backup tapes (How? In place of
   tar xvf /dev/sa0, you might accidentally type tar cvf /dev/sa0 and
   over-write your backup tape).

   For an added measure of security, make bootable floppies and two backup
   tapes each time. Store one of each at a remote location. A remote location
   is NOT the basement of the same office building. A number of firms in the
   World Trade Center learned this lesson the hard way. A remote location
   should be physically separated from your computers and disk drives by a
   significant distance.

    12.10.8.2 After the Disaster

   The key question is: did your hardware survive? You have been doing
   regular backups so there is no need to worry about the software.

   If the hardware has been damaged, the parts should be replaced before
   attempting to use the computer.

   If your hardware is okay, check your floppies. If you are using a custom
   boot floppy, boot single-user (type -s at the boot: prompt). Skip the
   following paragraph.

   If you are using the boot.flp and fixit.flp floppies, keep reading. Insert
   the boot.flp floppy in the first floppy drive and boot the computer. The
   original install menu will be displayed on the screen. Select the
   Fixit--Repair mode with CDROM or floppy. option. Insert the fixit.flp when
   prompted. restore and the other programs that you need are located in
   /mnt2/stand.

   Recover each file system separately.

   Try to mount (e.g. mount /dev/da0a /mnt) the root partition of your first
   disk. If the disklabel was damaged, use disklabel to re-partition and
   label the disk to match the label that you printed and saved. Use newfs to
   re-create the file systems. Re-mount the root partition of the floppy
   read-write (mount -u -o rw /mnt). Use your backup program and backup tapes
   to recover the data for this file system (e.g. restore vrf /dev/sa0).
   Unmount the file system (e.g. umount /mnt). Repeat for each file system
   that was damaged.

   Once your system is running, backup your data onto new tapes. Whatever
   caused the crash or data loss may strike again. Another hour spent now may
   save you from further distress later.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.11 Network, Memory, and File-Backed File Systems

   Reorganized and enhanced by Marc Fonvieille.

   Aside from the disks you physically insert into your computer: floppies,
   CDs, hard drives, and so forth; other forms of disks are understood by
   DragonFly - the virtual disks.

   These include network file systems such as the Network File System and
   Coda, memory-based file systems and file-backed file systems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.11.1 File-Backed File System

   The utility vnconfig(8) configures and enables vnode pseudo-disk devices.
   A vnode is a representation of a file, and is the focus of file activity.
   This means that vnconfig(8) uses files to create and operate a file
   system. One possible use is the mounting of floppy or CD images kept in
   files.

   To use vnconfig(8), you need vn(4) support in your kernel configuration
   file:

 pseudo-device vn

   To mount an existing file system image:

   Example 12-4. Using vnconfig to Mount an Existing File System Image

 # vnconfig vn0 diskimage
 # mount /dev/vn0c /mnt

   To create a new file system image with vnconfig(8):

   Example 12-5. Creating a New File-Backed Disk with vnconfig

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=newimage bs=1k count=5k
 5120+0 records in
 5120+0 records out
 # vnconfig -s labels -c vn0 newimage
 # disklabel -r -w vn0 auto
 # newfs vn0c
 Warning: 2048 sector(s) in last cylinder unallocated
 /dev/vn0c:     10240 sectors in 3 cylinders of 1 tracks, 4096 sectors
         5.0MB in 1 cyl groups (16 c/g, 32.00MB/g, 1280 i/g)
 super-block backups (for fsck -b #) at:
  32
 # mount /dev/vn0c /mnt
 # df /mnt
 Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
 /dev/vn0c        4927        1     4532     0%    /mnt

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.11.2 Memory-Based File System

   The md(4) driver is a simple, efficient means to create memory file
   systems. malloc(9) is used to allocate the memory.

   Simply take a file system you have prepared with, for example,
   vnconfig(8), and:

   Example 12-6. md Memory Disk

 # dd if=newimage of=/dev/md0
 5120+0 records in
 5120+0 records out
 # mount /dev/md0c /mnt

  12.11.3 Detaching a Memory Disk from the System

   When a memory-based or file-based file system is not used, you should
   release all resources to the system. The first thing to do is to unmount
   the file system, then use mdconfig(8) to detach the disk from the system
   and release the resources.

   For example to detach and free all resources used by /dev/md4:

 # mdconfig -d -u 4

   It is possible to list information about configured md(4) devices in using
   the command mdconfig -l.

   vnconfig(8) is used to detach the device. For example to detach and free
   all resources used by /dev/vn4:

 # vnconfig -u vn4

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.12 File System Quotas

   Quotas are an optional feature of the operating system that allow you to
   limit the amount of disk space and/or the number of files a user or
   members of a group may allocate on a per-file system basis. This is used
   most often on timesharing systems where it is desirable to limit the
   amount of resources any one user or group of users may allocate. This will
   prevent one user or group of users from consuming all of the available
   disk space.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.12.1 Configuring Your System to Enable Disk Quotas

   Before attempting to use disk quotas, it is necessary to make sure that
   quotas are configured in your kernel. This is done by adding the following
   line to your kernel configuration file:

 options QUOTA

   The stock GENERIC kernel does not have this enabled by default, so you
   will have to configure, build and install a custom kernel in order to use
   disk quotas. Please refer to Chapter 9 for more information on kernel
   configuration.

   Next you will need to enable disk quotas in /etc/rc.conf. This is done by
   adding the line:

 enable_quotas="YES"

   For finer control over your quota startup, there is an additional
   configuration variable available. Normally on bootup, the quota integrity
   of each file system is checked by the quotacheck(8) program. The
   quotacheck(8) facility insures that the data in the quota database
   properly reflects the data on the file system. This is a very time
   consuming process that will significantly affect the time your system
   takes to boot. If you would like to skip this step, a variable in
   /etc/rc.conf is made available for the purpose:

 check_quotas="NO"

   Finally you will need to edit /etc/fstab to enable disk quotas on a
   per-file system basis. This is where you can either enable user or group
   quotas or both for all of your file systems.

   To enable per-user quotas on a file system, add the userquota option to
   the options field in the /etc/fstab entry for the file system you want to
   enable quotas on. For example:

 /dev/da1s2g   /home    ufs rw,userquota 1 2

   Similarly, to enable group quotas, use the groupquota option instead of
   userquota. To enable both user and group quotas, change the entry as
   follows:

 /dev/da1s2g    /home    ufs rw,userquota,groupquota 1 2

   By default, the quota files are stored in the root directory of the file
   system with the names quota.user and quota.group for user and group quotas
   respectively. See fstab(5) for more information. Even though the fstab(5)
   manual page says that you can specify an alternate location for the quota
   files, this is not recommended because the various quota utilities do not
   seem to handle this properly.

   At this point you should reboot your system with your new kernel. /etc/rc
   will automatically run the appropriate commands to create the initial
   quota files for all of the quotas you enabled in /etc/fstab, so there is
   no need to manually create any zero length quota files.

   In the normal course of operations you should not be required to run the
   quotacheck(8), quotaon(8), or quotaoff(8) commands manually. However, you
   may want to read their manual pages just to be familiar with their
   operation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.12.2 Setting Quota Limits

   Once you have configured your system to enable quotas, verify that they
   really are enabled. An easy way to do this is to run:

 # quota -v

   You should see a one line summary of disk usage and current quota limits
   for each file system that quotas are enabled on.

   You are now ready to start assigning quota limits with the edquota(8)
   command.

   You have several options on how to enforce limits on the amount of disk
   space a user or group may allocate, and how many files they may create.
   You may limit allocations based on disk space (block quotas) or number of
   files (inode quotas) or a combination of both. Each of these limits are
   further broken down into two categories: hard and soft limits.

   A hard limit may not be exceeded. Once a user reaches his hard limit he
   may not make any further allocations on the file system in question. For
   example, if the user has a hard limit of 500 blocks on a file system and
   is currently using 490 blocks, the user can only allocate an additional 10
   blocks. Attempting to allocate an additional 11 blocks will fail.

   Soft limits, on the other hand, can be exceeded for a limited amount of
   time. This period of time is known as the grace period, which is one week
   by default. If a user stays over his or her soft limit longer than the
   grace period, the soft limit will turn into a hard limit and no further
   allocations will be allowed. When the user drops back below the soft
   limit, the grace period will be reset.

   The following is an example of what you might see when you run the
   edquota(8) command. When the edquota(8) command is invoked, you are placed
   into the editor specified by the EDITOR environment variable, or in the vi
   editor if the EDITOR variable is not set, to allow you to edit the quota
   limits.

 # edquota -u test

 Quotas for user test:
 /usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)
         inodes in use: 7, limits (soft = 50, hard = 60)
 /usr/var: blocks in use: 0, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)
         inodes in use: 0, limits (soft = 50, hard = 60)

   You will normally see two lines for each file system that has quotas
   enabled. One line for the block limits, and one line for inode limits.
   Simply change the value you want updated to modify the quota limit. For
   example, to raise this user's block limit from a soft limit of 50 and a
   hard limit of 75 to a soft limit of 500 and a hard limit of 600, change:

 /usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)

   to:

  /usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 500, hard = 600)

   The new quota limits will be in place when you exit the editor.

   Sometimes it is desirable to set quota limits on a range of UIDs. This can
   be done by use of the -p option on the edquota(8) command. First, assign
   the desired quota limit to a user, and then run edquota -p protouser
   startuid-enduid. For example, if user test has the desired quota limits,
   the following command can be used to duplicate those quota limits for UIDs
   10,000 through 19,999:

 # edquota -p test 10000-19999

   For more information see edquota(8) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.12.3 Checking Quota Limits and Disk Usage

   You can use either the quota(1) or the repquota(8) commands to check quota
   limits and disk usage. The quota(1) command can be used to check
   individual user or group quotas and disk usage. A user may only examine
   his own quota, and the quota of a group he is a member of. Only the
   super-user may view all user and group quotas. The repquota(8) command can
   be used to get a summary of all quotas and disk usage for file systems
   with quotas enabled.

   The following is some sample output from the quota -v command for a user
   that has quota limits on two file systems.

 Disk quotas for user test (uid 1002):
      Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
            /usr      65*     50      75   5days       7      50      60
        /usr/var       0      50      75               0      50      60

   On the /usr file system in the above example, this user is currently 15
   blocks over the soft limit of 50 blocks and has 5 days of the grace period
   left. Note the asterisk * which indicates that the user is currently over
   his quota limit.

   Normally file systems that the user is not using any disk space on will
   not show up in the output from the quota(1) command, even if he has a
   quota limit assigned for that file system. The -v option will display
   those file systems, such as the /usr/var file system in the above example.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  12.12.4 Quotas over NFS

   Quotas are enforced by the quota subsystem on the NFS server. The
   rpc.rquotad(8) daemon makes quota information available to the quota(1)
   command on NFS clients, allowing users on those machines to see their
   quota statistics.

   Enable rpc.rquotad in /etc/inetd.conf like so:

 rquotad/1      dgram rpc/udp wait root /usr/libexec/rpc.rquotad rpc.rquotad

   Now restart inetd:

 # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

                      Chapter 13 The Vinum Volume Manager

   Contributed by Greg Lehey.

13.1 Synopsis

   No matter what disks you have, there will always be limitations:

     * They can be too small.

     * They can be too slow.

     * They can be too unreliable.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.2 Disks Are Too Small

   Originally written by Greg Lehey.

   Vinum is a so-called Volume Manager, a virtual disk driver that addresses
   these three problems. Let us look at them in more detail. Various
   solutions to these problems have been proposed and implemented:

   Disks are getting bigger, but so are data storage requirements. Often you
   will find you want a file system that is bigger than the disks you have
   available. Admittedly, this problem is not as acute as it was ten years
   ago, but it still exists. Some systems have solved this by creating an
   abstract device which stores its data on a number of disks.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.3 Access Bottlenecks

   Modern systems frequently need to access data in a highly concurrent
   manner. For example, large FTP or HTTP servers can maintain thousands of
   concurrent sessions and have multiple 100 Mbit/s connections to the
   outside world, well beyond the sustained transfer rate of most disks.

   Current disk drives can transfer data sequentially at up to 70 MB/s, but
   this value is of little importance in an environment where many
   independent processes access a drive, where they may achieve only a
   fraction of these values. In such cases it is more interesting to view the
   problem from the viewpoint of the disk subsystem: the important parameter
   is the load that a transfer places on the subsystem, in other words the
   time for which a transfer occupies the drives involved in the transfer.

   In any disk transfer, the drive must first position the heads, wait for
   the first sector to pass under the read head, and then perform the
   transfer. These actions can be considered to be atomic: it does not make
   any sense to interrupt them.

   Consider a typical transfer of about 10 kB: the current generation of
   high-performance disks can position the heads in an average of 3.5 ms. The
   fastest drives spin at 15,000 rpm, so the average rotational latency (half
   a revolution) is 2 ms. At 70 MB/s, the transfer itself takes about 150 ms,
   almost nothing compared to the positioning time. In such a case, the
   effective transfer rate drops to a little over 1 MB/s and is clearly
   highly dependent on the transfer size.

   The traditional and obvious solution to this bottleneck is ``more
   spindles'': rather than using one large disk, it uses several smaller
   disks with the same aggregate storage space. Each disk is capable of
   positioning and transferring independently, so the effective throughput
   increases by a factor close to the number of disks used.

   The exact throughput improvement is, of course, smaller than the number of
   disks involved: although each drive is capable of transferring in
   parallel, there is no way to ensure that the requests are evenly
   distributed across the drives. Inevitably the load on one drive will be
   higher than on another.

   The evenness of the load on the disks is strongly dependent on the way the
   data is shared across the drives. In the following discussion, it is
   convenient to think of the disk storage as a large number of data sectors
   which are addressable by number, rather like the pages in a book. The most
   obvious method is to divide the virtual disk into groups of consecutive
   sectors the size of the individual physical disks and store them in this
   manner, rather like taking a large book and tearing it into smaller
   sections. This method is called concatenation and has the advantage that
   the disks are not required to have any specific size relationships. It
   works well when the access to the virtual disk is spread evenly about its
   address space. When access is concentrated on a smaller area, the
   improvement is less marked. Figure 13-1 illustrates the sequence in which
   storage units are allocated in a concatenated organization.

   Figure 13-1. Concatenated Organization

   An alternative mapping is to divide the address space into smaller,
   equal-sized components and store them sequentially on different devices.
   For example, the first 256 sectors may be stored on the first disk, the
   next 256 sectors on the next disk and so on. After filling the last disk,
   the process repeats until the disks are full. This mapping is called
   striping or RAID-0 [11]. Striping requires somewhat more effort to locate
   the data, and it can cause additional I/O load where a transfer is spread
   over multiple disks, but it can also provide a more constant load across
   the disks. Figure 13-2 illustrates the sequence in which storage units are
   allocated in a striped organization.

   Figure 13-2. Striped Organization

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.4 Data Integrity

   The final problem with current disks is that they are unreliable. Although
   disk drive reliability has increased tremendously over the last few years,
   they are still the most likely core component of a server to fail. When
   they do, the results can be catastrophic: replacing a failed disk drive
   and restoring data to it can take days.

   The traditional way to approach this problem has been mirroring, keeping
   two copies of the data on different physical hardware. Since the advent of
   the RAID levels, this technique has also been called RAID level 1 or
   RAID-1. Any write to the volume writes to both locations; a read can be
   satisfied from either, so if one drive fails, the data is still available
   on the other drive.

   Mirroring has two problems:

     * The price. It requires twice as much disk storage as a non-redundant
       solution.

     * The performance impact. Writes must be performed to both drives, so
       they take up twice the bandwidth of a non-mirrored volume. Reads do
       not suffer from a performance penalty: it even looks as if they are
       faster.

   An alternative solution is parity, implemented in the RAID levels 2, 3, 4
   and 5. Of these, RAID-5 is the most interesting. As implemented in Vinum,
   it is a variant on a striped organization which dedicates one block of
   each stripe to parity of the other blocks. As implemented by Vinum, a
   RAID-5 plex is similar to a striped plex, except that it implements RAID-5
   by including a parity block in each stripe. As required by RAID-5, the
   location of this parity block changes from one stripe to the next. The
   numbers in the data blocks indicate the relative block numbers.

   Figure 13-3. RAID-5 Organization

   Compared to mirroring, RAID-5 has the advantage of requiring significantly
   less storage space. Read access is similar to that of striped
   organizations, but write access is significantly slower, approximately 25%
   of the read performance. If one drive fails, the array can continue to
   operate in degraded mode: a read from one of the remaining accessible
   drives continues normally, but a read from the failed drive is
   recalculated from the corresponding block from all the remaining drives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.5 Vinum Objects

   In order to address these problems, Vinum implements a four-level
   hierarchy of objects:

     * The most visible object is the virtual disk, called a volume. Volumes
       have essentially the same properties as a UNIX disk drive, though
       there are some minor differences. They have no size limitations.

     * Volumes are composed of plexes, each of which represent the total
       address space of a volume. This level in the hierarchy thus provides
       redundancy. Think of plexes as individual disks in a mirrored array,
       each containing the same data.

     * Since Vinum exists within the UNIX disk storage framework, it would be
       possible to use UNIX partitions as the building block for multi-disk
       plexes, but in fact this turns out to be too inflexible: UNIX disks
       can have only a limited number of partitions. Instead, Vinum
       subdivides a single UNIX partition (the drive) into contiguous areas
       called subdisks, which it uses as building blocks for plexes.

     * Subdisks reside on Vinum drives, currently UNIX partitions. Vinum
       drives can contain any number of subdisks. With the exception of a
       small area at the beginning of the drive, which is used for storing
       configuration and state information, the entire drive is available for
       data storage.

   The following sections describe the way these objects provide the
   functionality required of Vinum.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.5.1 Volume Size Considerations

   Plexes can include multiple subdisks spread over all drives in the Vinum
   configuration. As a result, the size of an individual drive does not limit
   the size of a plex, and thus of a volume.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.5.2 Redundant Data Storage

   Vinum implements mirroring by attaching multiple plexes to a volume. Each
   plex is a representation of the data in a volume. A volume may contain
   between one and eight plexes.

   Although a plex represents the complete data of a volume, it is possible
   for parts of the representation to be physically missing, either by design
   (by not defining a subdisk for parts of the plex) or by accident (as a
   result of the failure of a drive). As long as at least one plex can
   provide the data for the complete address range of the volume, the volume
   is fully functional.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.5.3 Performance Issues

   Vinum implements both concatenation and striping at the plex level:

     * A concatenated plex uses the address space of each subdisk in turn.

     * A striped plex stripes the data across each subdisk. The subdisks must
       all have the same size, and there must be at least two subdisks in
       order to distinguish it from a concatenated plex.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.5.4 Which Plex Organization?

   Vinum implements two kinds of plex:

     * Concatenated plexes are the most flexible: they can contain any number
       of subdisks, and the subdisks may be of different length. The plex may
       be extended by adding additional subdisks. They require less CPU time
       than striped plexes, though the difference in CPU overhead is not
       measurable. On the other hand, they are most susceptible to hot spots,
       where one disk is very active and others are idle.

     * The greatest advantage of striped (RAID-0) plexes is that they reduce
       hot spots: by choosing an optimum sized stripe (about 256 kB), you can
       even out the load on the component drives. The disadvantages of this
       approach are (fractionally) more complex code and restrictions on
       subdisks: they must be all the same size, and extending a plex by
       adding new subdisks is so complicated that Vinum currently does not
       implement it. Vinum imposes an additional, trivial restriction: a
       striped plex must have at least two subdisks, since otherwise it is
       indistinguishable from a concatenated plex.

   Table 13-1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each plex
   organization.

13.6 Some Examples

   Vinum maintains a configuration database which describes the objects known
   to an individual system. Initially, the user creates the configuration
   database from one or more configuration files with the aid of the vinum(8)
   utility program. Vinum stores a copy of its configuration database on each
   disk slice (which Vinum calls a device) under its control. This database
   is updated on each state change, so that a restart accurately restores the
   state of each Vinum object.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.6.1 The Configuration File

   The configuration file describes individual Vinum objects. The definition
   of a simple volume might be:

     drive a device /dev/da3h
     volume myvol
       plex org concat
         sd length 512m drive a

   This file describes four Vinum objects:

     * The drive line describes a disk partition (drive) and its location
       relative to the underlying hardware. It is given the symbolic name a.
       This separation of the symbolic names from the device names allows
       disks to be moved from one location to another without confusion.

     * The volume line describes a volume. The only required attribute is the
       name, in this case myvol.

     * The plex line defines a plex. The only required parameter is the
       organization, in this case concat. No name is necessary: the system
       automatically generates a name from the volume name by adding the
       suffix .px, where x is the number of the plex in the volume. Thus this
       plex will be called myvol.p0.

     * The sd line describes a subdisk. The minimum specifications are the
       name of a drive on which to store it, and the length of the subdisk.
       As with plexes, no name is necessary: the system automatically assigns
       names derived from the plex name by adding the suffix .sx, where x is
       the number of the subdisk in the plex. Thus Vinum gives this subdisk
       the name myvol.p0.s0.

   After processing this file, vinum(8) produces the following output:

       # vinum -> create config1
       Configuration summary
       Drives:         1 (4 configured)
       Volumes:        1 (4 configured)
       Plexes:         1 (8 configured)
       Subdisks:       1 (16 configured)
     
         D a                     State: up       Device /dev/da3h        Avail: 2061/2573 MB (80%)
        
         V myvol                 State: up       Plexes:       1 Size:        512 MB
        
         P myvol.p0            C State: up       Subdisks:     1 Size:        512 MB
        
         S myvol.p0.s0           State: up       PO:        0  B Size:        512 MB

   This output shows the brief listing format of vinum(8). It is represented
   graphically in Figure 13-4.

   Figure 13-4. A Simple Vinum Volume

   This figure, and the ones which follow, represent a volume, which contains
   the plexes, which in turn contain the subdisks. In this trivial example,
   the volume contains one plex, and the plex contains one subdisk.

   This particular volume has no specific advantage over a conventional disk
   partition. It contains a single plex, so it is not redundant. The plex
   contains a single subdisk, so there is no difference in storage allocation
   from a conventional disk partition. The following sections illustrate
   various more interesting configuration methods.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.6.2 Increased Resilience: Mirroring

   The resilience of a volume can be increased by mirroring. When laying out
   a mirrored volume, it is important to ensure that the subdisks of each
   plex are on different drives, so that a drive failure will not take down
   both plexes. The following configuration mirrors a volume:

         drive b device /dev/da4h
         volume mirror
       plex org concat
         sd length 512m drive a
           plex org concat
             sd length 512m drive b

   In this example, it was not necessary to specify a definition of drive a
   again, since Vinum keeps track of all objects in its configuration
   database. After processing this definition, the configuration looks like:

         Volumes:        2 (4 configured)

   Figure 13-5 shows the structure graphically.

   Figure 13-5. A Mirrored Vinum Volume

   In this example, each plex contains the full 512 MB of address space. As
   in the previous example, each plex contains only a single subdisk.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.6.3 Optimizing Performance

   The mirrored volume in the previous example is more resistant to failure
   than an unmirrored volume, but its performance is less: each write to the
   volume requires a write to both drives, using up a greater proportion of
   the total disk bandwidth. Performance considerations demand a different
   approach: instead of mirroring, the data is striped across as many disk
   drives as possible. The following configuration shows a volume with a plex
   striped across four disk drives:

         drive c device /dev/da5h
         drive d device /dev/da6h
         volume stripe
         plex org striped 512k
           sd length 128m drive a
           sd length 128m drive b
           sd length 128m drive c
           sd length 128m drive d

   As before, it is not necessary to define the drives which are already
   known to Vinum. After processing this definition, the configuration looks
   like:

         Drives:         4 (4 configured)
         Volumes:        3 (4 configured)
         Plexes:         4 (8 configured)
         Subdisks:       7 (16 configured)
  
     D a                     State: up       Device /dev/da3h        Avail: 1421/2573 MB (55%)
     D b                     State: up       Device /dev/da4h        Avail: 1933/2573 MB (75%)
     D c                     State: up       Device /dev/da5h        Avail: 2445/2573 MB (95%)
     D d                     State: up       Device /dev/da6h        Avail: 2445/2573 MB (95%)

     P mirror.p0           C State: up       Subdisks:     1 Size:        512 MB

   Figure 13-6. A Striped Vinum Volume

   This volume is represented in Figure 13-6. The darkness of the stripes
   indicates the position within the plex address space: the lightest stripes
   come first, the darkest last.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.6.4 Resilience and Performance

   With sufficient hardware, it is possible to build volumes which show both
   increased resilience and increased performance compared to standard UNIX
   partitions. A typical configuration file might be:

         volume raid10
       plex org striped 512k
         sd length 102480k drive a
         sd length 102480k drive b
         sd length 102480k drive c
         sd length 102480k drive d
         sd length 102480k drive e
       plex org striped 512k
         sd length 102480k drive c
         sd length 102480k drive d
         sd length 102480k drive e
         sd length 102480k drive a
         sd length 102480k drive b

   The subdisks of the second plex are offset by two drives from those of the
   first plex: this helps ensure that writes do not go to the same subdisks
   even if a transfer goes over two drives.

   Figure 13-7 represents the structure of this volume.

   Figure 13-7. A Mirrored, Striped Vinum Volume

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.7 Object Naming

   As described above, Vinum assigns default names to plexes and subdisks,
   although they may be overridden. Overriding the default names is not
   recommended: experience with the VERITAS volume manager, which allows
   arbitrary naming of objects, has shown that this flexibility does not
   bring a significant advantage, and it can cause confusion.

   Names may contain any non-blank character, but it is recommended to
   restrict them to letters, digits and the underscore characters. The names
   of volumes, plexes and subdisks may be up to 64 characters long, and the
   names of drives may be up to 32 characters long.

   Vinum objects are assigned device nodes in the hierarchy /dev/vinum. The
   configuration shown above would cause Vinum to create the following device
   nodes:

     * The control devices /dev/vinum/control and /dev/vinum/controld, which
       are used by vinum(8) and the Vinum daemon respectively.

     * Block and character device entries for each volume. These are the main
       devices used by Vinum. The block device names are the name of the
       volume, while the character device names follow the BSD tradition of
       prepending the letter r to the name. Thus the configuration above
       would include the block devices /dev/vinum/myvol, /dev/vinum/mirror,
       /dev/vinum/striped, /dev/vinum/raid5 and /dev/vinum/raid10, and the
       character devices /dev/vinum/rmyvol, /dev/vinum/rmirror,
       /dev/vinum/rstriped, /dev/vinum/rraid5 and /dev/vinum/rraid10. There
       is obviously a problem here: it is possible to have two volumes called
       r and rr, but there will be a conflict creating the device node
       /dev/vinum/rr: is it a character device for volume r or a block device
       for volume rr? Currently Vinum does not address this conflict: the
       first-defined volume will get the name.

     * A directory /dev/vinum/drive with entries for each drive. These
       entries are in fact symbolic links to the corresponding disk nodes.

     * A directory /dev/vinum/volume with entries for each volume. It
       contains subdirectories for each plex, which in turn contain
       subdirectories for their component subdisks.

     * The directories /dev/vinum/plex, /dev/vinum/sd, and /dev/vinum/rsd,
       which contain block device nodes for each plex and block and character
       device nodes respectively for each subdisk.

   For example, consider the following configuration file:

         drive drive1 device /dev/sd1h
         drive drive2 device /dev/sd2h
         drive drive3 device /dev/sd3h
         drive drive4 device /dev/sd4h
     volume s64 setupstate
       plex org striped 64k
         sd length 100m drive drive1
         sd length 100m drive drive2
         sd length 100m drive drive3
         sd length 100m drive drive4

   After processing this file, vinum(8) creates the following structure in
   /dev/vinum:

         brwx------  1 root  wheel   25, 0x40000001 Apr 13 16:46 Control

   Although it is recommended that plexes and subdisks should not be
   allocated specific names, Vinum drives must be named. This makes it
   possible to move a drive to a different location and still recognize it
   automatically. Drive names may be up to 32 characters long.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.7.1 Creating File Systems

   Volumes appear to the system to be identical to disks, with one exception.
   Unlike UNIX drives, Vinum does not partition volumes, which thus do not
   contain a partition table. This has required modification to some disk
   utilities, notably newfs(8), which previously tried to interpret the last
   letter of a Vinum volume name as a partition identifier. For example, a
   disk drive may have a name like /dev/ad0a or /dev/da2h. These names
   represent the first partition (a) on the first (0) IDE disk (ad) and the
   eighth partition (h) on the third (2) SCSI disk (da) respectively. By
   contrast, a Vinum volume might be called /dev/vinum/concat, a name which
   has no relationship with a partition name.

   Normally, newfs(8) interprets the name of the disk and complains if it
   cannot understand it. For example:

 # newfs /dev/vinum/concat
 newfs: /dev/vinum/concat: can't figure out file system partition

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.8 Configuring Vinum

   The GENERIC kernel does not contain Vinum. It is possible to build a
   special kernel which includes Vinum, but this is not recommended. The
   standard way to start Vinum is as a kernel module (kld). You do not even
   need to use kldload(8) for Vinum: when you start vinum(8), it checks
   whether the module has been loaded, and if it is not, it loads it
   automatically.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.8.1 Startup

   Vinum stores configuration information on the disk slices in essentially
   the same form as in the configuration files. When reading from the
   configuration database, Vinum recognizes a number of keywords which are
   not allowed in the configuration files. For example, a disk configuration
   might contain the following text:

 volume myvol state up
 volume bigraid state down
 plex name myvol.p0 state up org concat vol myvol
 plex name myvol.p1 state up org concat vol myvol
 plex name myvol.p2 state init org striped 512b vol myvol
 plex name bigraid.p0 state initializing org raid5 512b vol bigraid
 sd name myvol.p0.s0 drive a plex myvol.p0 state up len 1048576b driveoffset 265b plexoffset 0b
 sd name myvol.p0.s1 drive b plex myvol.p0 state up len 1048576b driveoffset 265b plexoffset 1048576b
 sd name myvol.p1.s0 drive c plex myvol.p1 state up len 1048576b driveoffset 265b plexoffset 0b
 sd name myvol.p1.s1 drive d plex myvol.p1 state up len 1048576b driveoffset 265b plexoffset 1048576b
 sd name myvol.p2.s0 drive a plex myvol.p2 state init len 524288b driveoffset 1048841b plexoffset 0b
 sd name myvol.p2.s1 drive b plex myvol.p2 state init len 524288b driveoffset 1048841b plexoffset 524288b
 sd name myvol.p2.s2 drive c plex myvol.p2 state init len 524288b driveoffset 1048841b plexoffset 1048576b
 sd name myvol.p2.s3 drive d plex myvol.p2 state init len 524288b driveoffset 1048841b plexoffset 1572864b
 sd name bigraid.p0.s0 drive a plex bigraid.p0 state initializing len 4194304b driveoff set 1573129b plexoffset 0b
 sd name bigraid.p0.s1 drive b plex bigraid.p0 state initializing len 4194304b driveoff set 1573129b plexoffset 4194304b
 sd name bigraid.p0.s2 drive c plex bigraid.p0 state initializing len 4194304b driveoff set 1573129b plexoffset 8388608b
 sd name bigraid.p0.s3 drive d plex bigraid.p0 state initializing len 4194304b driveoff set 1573129b plexoffset 12582912b
 sd name bigraid.p0.s4 drive e plex bigraid.p0 state initializing len 4194304b driveoff set 1573129b plexoffset 16777216b

   The obvious differences here are the presence of explicit location
   information and naming (both of which are also allowed, but discouraged,
   for use by the user) and the information on the states (which are not
   available to the user). Vinum does not store information about drives in
   the configuration information: it finds the drives by scanning the
   configured disk drives for partitions with a Vinum label. This enables
   Vinum to identify drives correctly even if they have been assigned
   different UNIX drive IDs.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    13.8.1.1 Automatic Startup

   In order to start Vinum automatically when you boot the system, ensure
   that you have the following line in your /etc/rc.conf:

 start_vinum="YES"               # set to YES to start vinum

   If you do not have a file /etc/rc.conf, create one with this content. This
   will cause the system to load the Vinum kld at startup, and to start any
   objects mentioned in the configuration. This is done before mounting file
   systems, so it is possible to automatically fsck(8) and mount file systems
   on Vinum volumes.

   When you start Vinum with the vinum start command, Vinum reads the
   configuration database from one of the Vinum drives. Under normal
   circumstances, each drive contains an identical copy of the configuration
   database, so it does not matter which drive is read. After a crash,
   however, Vinum must determine which drive was updated most recently and
   read the configuration from this drive. It then updates the configuration
   if necessary from progressively older drives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.9 Using Vinum for the Root Filesystem

   For a machine that has fully-mirrored filesystems using Vinum, it is
   desirable to also mirror the root filesystem. Setting up such a
   configuration is less trivial than mirroring an arbitrary filesystem
   because:

     * The root filesystem must be available very early during the boot
       process, so the Vinum infrastructure must already be available at this
       time.

     * The volume containing the root filesystem also contains the system
       bootstrap and the kernel, which must be read using the host system's
       native utilities (e. g. the BIOS on PC-class machines) which often
       cannot be taught about the details of Vinum.

   In the following sections, the term ``root volume'' is generally used to
   describe the Vinum volume that contains the root filesystem. It is
   probably a good idea to use the name "root" for this volume, but this is
   not technically required in any way. All command examples in the following
   sections assume this name though.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.9.1 Starting up Vinum Early Enough for the Root Filesystem

   There are several measures to take for this to happen:

     * Vinum must be available in the kernel at boot-time. Thus, the method
       to start Vinum automatically described in Section 13.8.1.1 is not
       applicable to accomplish this task, and the start_vinum parameter must
       actually not be set when the following setup is being arranged. The
       first option would be to compile Vinum statically into the kernel, so
       it is available all the time, but this is usually not desirable. There
       is another option as well, to have /boot/loader (Section 7.3.3) load
       the vinum kernel module early, before starting the kernel. This can be
       accomplished by putting the line

       vinum_load="YES"

       into the file /boot/loader.conf.

     * Vinum must be initialized early since it needs to supply the volume
       for the root filesystem. By default, the Vinum kernel part is not
       looking for drives that might contain Vinum volume information until
       the administrator (or one of the startup scripts) issues a vinum start
       command.

       Vinum must explicitly be told which disks to scan, using a line like
       the following one in /boot/loader.conf:

       vinum.drives="/dev/da0 /dev/da1"

       It is important that all drives are mentioned that could possibly
       contain Vinum data. It does not harm if more drives are listed, nor is
       it necessary to add each slice and/or partition explicitly, since
       Vinum will scan all slices and partitions of the named drives for
       valid Vinum headers.

       Since the routines used to parse the name of the root filesystem, and
       derive the device ID (major/minor number) are only prepared to handle
       ``classical'' device names like /dev/ad0s1a, they cannot make any
       sense out of a root volume name like /dev/vinum/root. For that reason,
       Vinum itself needs to pre-setup the internal kernel parameter that
       holds the ID of the root device during its own initialization. This is
       requested by passing the name of the root volume in the loader
       variable vinum.root. The entry in /boot/loader.conf to accomplish this
       looks like:

       vinum.root="root"

       Now, when the kernel initialization tries to find out the root device
       to mount, it sees whether some kernel module has already
       pre-initialized the kernel parameter for it. If that is the case, and
       the device claiming the root device matches the major number of the
       driver as figured out from the name of the root device string being
       passed (that is, "vinum" in our case), it will use the pre-allocated
       device ID, instead of trying to figure out one itself. That way,
       during the usual automatic startup, it can continue to mount the Vinum
       root volume for the root filesystem.

       However, when boot -a has been requesting to ask for entering the name
       of the root device manually, it must be noted that this routine still
       cannot actually parse a name entered there that refers to a Vinum
       volume. If any device name is entered that does not refer to a Vinum
       device, the mismatch between the major numbers of the pre-allocated
       root parameter and the driver as figured out from the given name will
       make this routine enter its normal parser, so entering a string like
       ufs:da0d will work as expected. Note that if this fails, it is however
       no longer possible to re-enter a string like ufs:vinum/root again,
       since it cannot be parsed. The only way out is to reboot again, and
       start over then. (At the ``askroot'' prompt, the initial /dev/ can
       always be omitted.)

       By placing the line:

       vinum.drives="/dev/da0 /dev/da1"

       vinum.autostart="YES"

       into /boot/loader.conf, Vinum is instructed to automatically scan all
       drives for Vinum information as part of the kernel startup.

       It is important that all drives are mentioned that could possibly
       contain Vinum data. It does not harm if more drives are listed, nor is
       it necessary to add each slice and/or partition explicitly, since
       Vinum will scan all slices and partitions of the named drives for
       valid Vinum headers.

       Vinum itself needs to pre-setup the internal kernel parameter that
       holds the ID of the root device during its own initialization. This is
       requested by passing the name of the root volume in the loader
       variable vinum.root. The entry in /boot/loader.conf to accomplish this
       looks like:

       vinum.root="root"

       Now, when the kernel initialization tries to find out the root device
       to mount, it sees whether some kernel module has already
       pre-initialized the kernel parameter for it. If that is the case, and
       the device claiming the root device matches the major number of the
       driver as figured out from the name of the root device string being
       passed (that is, "vinum" in our case), it will use the pre-allocated
       device ID, instead of trying to figure out one itself. That way,
       during the usual automatic startup, it can continue to mount the Vinum
       root volume for the root filesystem.

       However, when boot -a has been requesting to ask for entering the name
       of the root device manually, it must be noted that this routine still
       cannot actually parse a name entered there that refers to a Vinum
       volume. If any device name is entered that does not refer to a Vinum
       device, the mismatch between the major numbers of the pre-allocated
       root parameter and the driver as figured out from the given name will
       make this routine enter its normal parser, so entering a string like
       ufs:da0d will work as expected. Note that if this fails, it is however
       no longer possible to re-enter a string like ufs:vinum/root again,
       since it cannot be parsed. The only way out is to reboot again, and
       start over then. (At the ``askroot'' prompt, the initial /dev/ can
       always be omitted.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.9.2 Making a Vinum-based Root Volume Accessible to the Bootstrap

   Since the current DragonFly bootstrap is very small, and already has the
   burden of reading files (like /boot/loader) from the UFS filesystem, it is
   sheer impossible to also teach it about internal Vinum structures so it
   could parse the Vinum configuration data, and figure out about the
   elements of a boot volume itself. Thus, some tricks are necessary to
   provide the bootstrap code with the illusion of a standard "a" partition
   that contains the root filesystem.

   For this to be possible at all, the following requirements must be met for
   the root volume:

     * The root volume must not be striped or RAID-5.

     * The root volume must not contain more than one concatenated subdisk
       per plex.

   Note that it is desirable and possible that there are multiple plexes,
   each containing one replica of the root filesystem. The bootstrap process
   will, however, only use one of these replica for finding the bootstrap and
   all the files, until the kernel will eventually mount the root filesystem
   itself. Each single subdisk within these plexes will then need its own "a"
   partition illusion, for the respective device to become bootable. It is
   not strictly needed that each of these faked "a" partitions is located at
   the same offset within its device, compared with other devices containing
   plexes of the root volume. However, it is probably a good idea to create
   the Vinum volumes that way so the resulting mirrored devices are
   symmetric, to avoid confusion.

   In order to set up these "a" partitions, for each device containing part
   of the root volume, the following needs to be done:

    1. The location (offset from the beginning of the device) and size of
       this device's subdisk that is part of the root volume need to be
       examined, using the command

       vinum l -rv root

       Note that Vinum offsets and sizes are measured in bytes. They must be
       divided by 512 in order to obtain the block numbers that are to be
       used in the disklabel command.

    2. Run the command

       disklabel -e devname

       for each device that participates in the root volume. devname must be
       either the name of the disk (like da0) for disks without a slice (aka.
       fdisk) table, or the name of the slice (like ad0s1).

       If there is already an "a" partition on the device (presumably,
       containing a pre-Vinum root filesystem), it should be renamed to
       something else, so it remains accessible (just in case), but will no
       longer be used by default to bootstrap the system. Note that active
       partitions (like a root filesystem currently mounted) cannot be
       renamed, so this must be executed either when being booted from a
       ``Fixit'' medium, or in a two-step process, where (in a mirrored
       situation) the disk that has not been currently booted is being
       manipulated first.

       Then, the offset the Vinum partition on this device (if any) must be
       added to the offset of the respective root volume subdisk on this
       device. The resulting value will become the "offset" value for the new
       "a" partition. The "size" value for this partition can be taken
       verbatim from the calculation above. The "fstype" should be 4.2BSD.
       The "fsize", "bsize", and "cpg" values should best be chosen to match
       the actual filesystem, though they are fairly unimportant within this
       context.

       That way, a new "a" partition will be established that overlaps the
       Vinum partition on this device. Note that the disklabel will only
       allow for this overlap if the Vinum partition has properly been marked
       using the "vinum" fstype.

    3. That's all! A faked "a" partition does exist now on each device that
       has one replica of the root volume. It is highly recommendable to
       verify the result again, using a command like

       fsck -n /dev/devnamea

   It should be remembered that all files containing control information must
   be relative to the root filesystem in the Vinum volume which, when setting
   up a new Vinum root volume, might not match the root filesystem that is
   currently active. So in particular, the files /etc/fstab and
   /boot/loader.conf need to be taken care of.

   At next reboot, the bootstrap should figure out the appropriate control
   information from the new Vinum-based root filesystem, and act accordingly.
   At the end of the kernel initialization process, after all devices have
   been announced, the prominent notice that shows the success of this setup
   is a message like:

 Mounting root from ufs:/dev/vinum/root

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.9.3 Example of a Vinum-based Root Setup

   After the Vinum root volume has been set up, the output of vinum l -rv
   root could look like:

 ...
 Subdisk root.p0.s0:
                 Size:        125829120 bytes (120 MB)
                 State: up
                 Plex root.p0 at offset 0 (0  B)
                 Drive disk0 (/dev/da0h) at offset 135680 (132 kB)

 Subdisk root.p1.s0:
                 Size:        125829120 bytes (120 MB)
                 State: up
                 Plex root.p1 at offset 0 (0  B)
                 Drive disk1 (/dev/da1h) at offset 135680 (132 kB)
        

   The values to note are 135680 for the offset (relative to partition
   /dev/da0h). This translates to 265 512-byte disk blocks in disklabel's
   terms. Likewise, the size of this root volume is 245760 512-byte blocks.
   /dev/da1h, containing the second replica of this root volume, has a
   symmetric setup.

   The disklabel for these devices might look like:

 ...
 8 partitions:
 #        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
   a:   245760      281    4.2BSD     2048 16384     0   # (Cyl.    0*- 15*)
   c: 71771688        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 4467*)
   h: 71771672       16     vinum                        # (Cyl.    0*- 4467*)
        

   It can be observed that the "size" parameter for the faked "a" partition
   matches the value outlined above, while the "offset" parameter is the sum
   of the offset within the Vinum partition "h", and the offset of this
   partition within the device (or slice). This is a typical setup that is
   necessary to avoid the problem described in Section 13.9.4.3. It can also
   be seen that the entire "a" partition is completely within the "h"
   partition containing all the Vinum data for this device.

   Note that in the above example, the entire device is dedicated to Vinum,
   and there is no leftover pre-Vinum root partition, since this has been a
   newly set-up disk that was only meant to be part of a Vinum configuration,
   ever.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  13.9.4 Troubleshooting

   If something goes wrong, a way is needed to recover from the situation.
   The following list contains few known pitfalls and solutions.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    13.9.4.1 System Bootstrap Loads, but System Does Not Boot

   If for any reason the system does not continue to boot, the bootstrap can
   be interrupted with by pressing the space key at the 10-seconds warning.
   The loader variables (like vinum.autostart) can be examined using the
   show, and manipulated using set or unset commands.

   If the only problem was that the Vinum kernel module was not yet in the
   list of modules to load automatically, a simple load vinum will help.

   When ready, the boot process can be continued with a boot -as. The options
   -as will request the kernel to ask for the root filesystem to mount (-a),
   and make the boot process stop in single-user mode (-s), where the root
   filesystem is mounted read-only. That way, even if only one plex of a
   multi-plex volume has been mounted, no data inconsistency between plexes
   is being risked.

   At the prompt asking for a root filesystem to mount, any device that
   contains a valid root filesystem can be entered. If /etc/fstab had been
   set up correctly, the default should be something like
   ufs:/dev/vinum/root. A typical alternate choice would be something like
   ufs:da0d which could be a hypothetical partition that contains the
   pre-Vinum root filesystem. Care should be taken if one of the alias "a"
   partitions are entered here that are actually reference to the subdisks of
   the Vinum root device, because in a mirrored setup, this would only mount
   one piece of a mirrored root device. If this filesystem is to be mounted
   read-write later on, it is necessary to remove the other plex(es) of the
   Vinum root volume since these plexes would otherwise carry inconsistent
   data.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    13.9.4.2 Only Primary Bootstrap Loads

   If /boot/loader fails to load, but the primary bootstrap still loads
   (visible by a single dash in the left column of the screen right after the
   boot process starts), an attempt can be made to interrupt the primary
   bootstrap at this point, using the space key. This will make the bootstrap
   stop in stage two, see Section 7.3.2. An attempt can be made here to boot
   off an alternate partition, like the partition containing the previous
   root filesystem that has been moved away from "a" above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    13.9.4.3 Nothing Boots, the Bootstrap Panics

   This situation will happen if the bootstrap had been destroyed by the
   Vinum installation. Unfortunately, Vinum accidentally currently leaves
   only 4 KB at the beginning of its partition free before starting to write
   its Vinum header information. However, the stage one and two bootstraps
   plus the disklabel embedded between them currently require 8 KB. So if a
   Vinum partition was started at offset 0 within a slice or disk that was
   meant to be bootable, the Vinum setup will trash the bootstrap.

   Similarly, if the above situation has been recovered, for example by
   booting from a ``Fixit'' medium, and the bootstrap has been re-installed
   using disklabel -B as described in Section 7.3.2, the bootstrap will trash
   the Vinum header, and Vinum will no longer find its disk(s). Though no
   actual Vinum configuration data or data in Vinum volumes will be trashed
   by this, and it would be possible to recover all the data by entering
   exact the same Vinum configuration data again, the situation is hard to
   fix at all. It would be necessary to move the entire Vinum partition by at
   least 4 KB off, in order to have the Vinum header and the system bootstrap
   no longer collide.

              Chapter 14 Localization - I18N/L10N Usage and Setup

   Contributed by Andrey A. Chernov. Rewritten by Michael C. Wu.

14.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly is a very distributed project with users and contributors
   located all over the world. This chapter discusses the
   internationalization and localization features of DragonFly that allow
   non-English speaking users to get real work done. There are many aspects
   of the i18n implementation in both the system and application levels, so
   where applicable we refer the reader to more specific sources of
   documentation.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How different languages and locales are encoded on modern operating
       systems.

     * How to set the locale for your login shell.

     * How to configure your console for non-English languages.

     * How to use X Window System effectively with different languages.

     * Where to find more information about writing i18n-compliant
       applications.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to install additional third-party applications (Chapter 4).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

14.2 The Basics

  14.2.1 What Is I18N/L10N?

   Developers shortened internationalization into the term I18N, counting the
   number of letters between the first and the last letters of
   internationalization. L10N uses the same naming scheme, coming from
   ``localization''. Combined together, I18N/L10N methods, protocols, and
   applications allow users to use languages of their choice.

   I18N applications are programmed using I18N kits under libraries. It
   allows for developers to write a simple file and translate displayed menus
   and texts to each language. We strongly encourage programmers to follow
   this convention.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.2.2 Why Should I Use I18N/L10N?

   I18N/L10N is used whenever you wish to either view, input, or process data
   in non-English languages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.2.3 What Languages Are Supported in the I18N Effort?

   I18N and L10N are not DragonFly specific. Currently, one can choose from
   most of the major languages of the World, including but not limited to:
   Chinese, German, Japanese, Korean, French, Russian, Vietnamese and others.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

14.3 Using Localization

   In all its splendor, I18N is not DragonFly-specific and is a convention.
   We encourage you to help DragonFly in following this convention.

   Localization settings are based on three main terms: Language Code,
   Country Code, and Encoding. Locale names are constructed from these parts
   as follows:

 LanguageCode_CountryCode.Encoding

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.1 Language and Country Codes

   In order to localize a DragonFly system to a specific language (or any
   other I18N-supporting UNIX like systems), the user needs to find out the
   codes for the specify country and language (country codes tell
   applications what variation of given language to use). In addition, web
   browsers, SMTP/POP servers, web servers, etc. make decisions based on
   them. The following are examples of language/country codes:

   Language/Country Code          Description           
   en_US                 English - United States        
   ru_RU                 Russian for Russia             
   zh_TW                 Traditional Chinese for Taiwan 

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.2 Encodings

   Some languages use non-ASCII encodings that are 8-bit, wide or multibyte
   characters, see multibyte(3) for more details. Older applications do not
   recognize them and mistake them for control characters. Newer applications
   usually do recognize 8-bit characters. Depending on the implementation,
   users may be required to compile an application with wide or multibyte
   characters support, or configure it correctly. To be able to input and
   process wide or multibyte characters, the FreeBSD Ports collection has
   provided each language with different programs. Refer to the I18N
   documentation in the respective FreeBSD Port.

   Specifically, the user needs to look at the application documentation to
   decide on how to configure it correctly or to pass correct values into the
   configure/Makefile/compiler.

   Some things to keep in mind are:

     * Language specific single C chars character sets (see multibyte(3)),
       e.g. ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, KOI8-R, CP437.

     * Wide or multibyte encodings, e.g. EUC, Big5.

   You can check the active list of character sets at the IANA Registry.

     Note: DragonFly uses X11-compatible locale encodings instead.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.3 I18N Applications

   In the FreeBSD Ports and Package system, I18N applications have been named
   with I18N in their names for easy identification. However, they do not
   always support the language needed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.4 Setting Locale

   Usually it is sufficient to export the value of the locale name as LANG in
   the login shell. This could be done in the user's ~/.login_conf file or in
   the startup file of the user's shell (~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.cshrc).
   There is no need to set the locale subsets such as LC_CTYPE, LC_CTIME.
   Please refer to language-specific DragonFly documentation for more
   information.

   You should set the following two environment variables in your
   configuration files:

     * LANG for POSIX setlocale(3) family functions

     * MM_CHARSET for applications' MIME character set

   This includes the user shell configuration, the specific application
   configuration, and the X11 configuration.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.3.4.1 Setting Locale Methods

   There are two methods for setting locale, and both are described below.
   The first (recommended one) is by assigning the environment variables in
   login class, and the second is by adding the environment variable
   assignments to the system's shell startup file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      14.3.4.1.1 Login Classes Method

   This method allows environment variables needed for locale name and MIME
   character sets to be assigned once for every possible shell instead of
   adding specific shell assignments to each shell's startup file. User Level
   Setup can be done by an user himself and Administrator Level Setup require
   superuser privileges.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        14.3.4.1.1.1 User Level Setup

   Here is a minimal example of a .login_conf file in user's home directory
   which has both variables set for Latin-1 encoding:

 me:\
         :charset=ISO-8859-1:\
         :lang=de_DE.ISO8859-1:

   Here is an example of a .login_conf that sets the variables for
   Traditional Chinese in BIG-5 encoding. Notice the many more variables set
   because some software does not respect locale variables correctly for
   Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

 #Users who do not wish to use monetary units or time formats
 #of Taiwan can manually change each variable
 me:\
         :lang=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_all=zh_TW.Big:\
         :lc_collate=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_ctype=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_messages=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_monetary=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_numeric=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :lc_time=zh_TW.Big5:\
         :charset=big5:\
         :xmodifiers="@im=xcin": #Setting the XIM Input Server

   See Administrator Level Setup and login.conf(5) for more details.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        14.3.4.1.1.2 Administrator Level Setup

   Verify that the user's login class in /etc/login.conf sets the correct
   language. Make sure these settings appear in /etc/login.conf:

 language_name:accounts_title:\
         :charset=MIME_charset:\
         :lang=locale_name:\
         :tc=default:

   So sticking with our previous example using Latin-1, it would look like
   this:

 german:German Users Accounts:\
         :charset=ISO-8859-1:\
         :lang=de_DE.ISO8859-1:\
         :tc=default:

      Changing Login Classes with vipw(8)

   Use vipw to add new users, and make the entry look like this:

 user:password:1111:11:language:0:0:User Name:/home/user:/bin/sh

      Changing Login Classes with adduser(8)

   Use adduser to add new users, and do the following:

     * Set defaultclass = language in /etc/adduser.conf. Keep in mind you
       must enter a default class for all users of other languages in this
       case.

     * An alternative variant is answering the specified language each time
       that

 Enter login class: default []:

       appears from adduser(8).

     * Another alternative is to use the following for each user of a
       different language that you wish to add:

 # adduser -class language

      Changing Login Classes with pw(8)

   If you use pw(8) for adding new users, call it in this form:

 # pw useradd user_name -L language

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      14.3.4.1.2 Shell Startup File Method

     Note: This method is not recommended because it requires a different
     setup for each possible shell program chosen. Use the Login Class Method
     instead.

   To add the locale name and MIME character set, just set the two
   environment variables shown below in the /etc/profile and/or
   /etc/csh.login shell startup files. We will use the German language as an
   example below:

   In /etc/profile:

 LANG=de_DE.ISO8859-1; export LANG
 MM_CHARSET=ISO-8859-1; export MM_CHARSET

   Or in /etc/csh.login:

 setenv LANG de_DE.ISO8859-1
 setenv MM_CHARSET ISO-8859-1

   Alternatively, you can add the above instructions to
   /usr/share/skel/dot.profile (similar to what was used in /etc/profile
   above), or /usr/share/skel/dot.login (similar to what was used in
   /etc/csh.login above).

   For X11:

   In $HOME/.xinitrc:

 LANG=de_DE.ISO8859-1; export LANG

   Or:

 setenv LANG de_DE.ISO8859-1

   Depending on your shell (see above).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.5 Console Setup

   For all single C chars character sets, set the correct console fonts in
   /etc/rc.conf for the language in question with:

 font8x16=font_name
 font8x14=font_name
 font8x8=font_name

   The font_name here is taken from the /usr/share/syscons/fonts directory,
   without the .fnt suffix.

   Also be sure to set the correct keymap and screenmap for your single C
   chars character set. You can add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

 scrnmap=screenmap_name
 keymap=keymap_name
 keychange="fkey_number sequence"

   The screenmap_name here is taken from the /usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps
   directory, without the .scm suffix. A screenmap with a corresponding
   mapped font is usually needed as a workaround for expanding bit 8 to bit 9
   on a VGA adapter's font character matrix in pseudographics area, i.e., to
   move letters out of that area if screen font uses a bit 8 column.

   If you have the moused daemon enabled by setting the following in your
   /etc/rc.conf:

 moused_enable="YES"

   then examine the mouse cursor information in the next paragraph.

   By default the mouse cursor of the syscons(4) driver occupies the
   0xd0-0xd3 range in the character set. If your language uses this range,
   you need to move the cursor's range outside of it. To enable this
   workaround, insert the following line into your kernel configuration:

 options         SC_MOUSE_CHAR=0x03

   Insert the following line into /etc/rc.conf:

 mousechar_start=3

   The keymap_name here is taken from the /usr/share/syscons/keymaps
   directory, without the .kbd suffix. If you're uncertain which keymap to
   use, you use can kbdmap(1) to test keymaps without rebooting.

   The keychange is usually needed to program function keys to match the
   selected terminal type because function key sequences cannot be defined in
   the key map.

   Also be sure to set the correct console terminal type in /etc/ttys for all
   ttyv* entries. Current pre-defined correspondences are:

         Character Set       Terminal Type 
   ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 cons25l1      
   ISO-8859-2                cons25l2      
   ISO-8859-7                cons25l7      
   KOI8-R                    cons25r       
   KOI8-U                    cons25u       
   CP437 (VGA default)       cons25        
   US-ASCII                  cons25w       

   For wide or multibyte characters languages, use the correct FreeBSD port
   in your /usr/ports/language directory. Some ports appear as console while
   the system sees it as serial vtty's, hence you must reserve enough vtty's
   for both X11 and the pseudo-serial console. Here is a partial list of
   applications for using other languages in console:

            Language                          Location                 
   Traditional Chinese (BIG-5) chinese/big5con                         
   Japanese                    japanese/ja-kon2-* or japanese/Mule_Wnn 
   Korean                      korean/ko-han                           

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.6 X11 Setup

   Although X11 is not part of DragonFly, we have included some information
   here for DragonFly users. For more details, refer to the XFree86 web site
   or whichever X11 Server you use.

   In ~/.Xresources, you can additionally tune application specific I18N
   settings (e.g., fonts, menus, etc.).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.3.6.1 Displaying Fonts

   Install the X11 TrueType Common server (x11-servers/XttXF86srv-common) and
   install the language TrueType fonts. Setting the correct locale should
   allow you to view your selected language in menus and such.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.3.6.2 Inputting Non-English Characters

   The X11 Input Method (XIM) Protocol is a new standard for all X11 clients.
   All X11 applications should be written as XIM clients that take input from
   XIM Input servers. There are several XIM servers available for different
   languages.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.7 Printer Setup

   Some single C chars character sets are usually hardware coded into
   printers. Wide or multibyte character sets require special setup and we
   recommend using apsfilter. You may also convert the document to PostScript
   or PDF formats using language specific converters.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.3.8 Kernel and File Systems

   The DragonFly fast filesystem (FFS) is 8-bit clean, so it can be used with
   any single C chars character set (see multibyte(3)), but there is no
   character set name stored in the filesystem; i.e., it is raw 8-bit and
   does not know anything about encoding order. Officially, FFS does not
   support any form of wide or multibyte character sets yet. However, some
   wide or multibyte character sets have independent patches for FFS enabling
   such support. They are only temporary unportable solutions or hacks and we
   have decided to not include them in the source tree. Refer to respective
   languages' web sites for more informations and the patch files.

   The DragonFly MS-DOS filesystem has the configurable ability to convert
   between MS-DOS, Unicode character sets and chosen DragonFly filesystem
   character sets. See mount_msdos(8) for details.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

14.4 Compiling I18N Programs

   Many FreeBSD Ports have been ported with I18N support. Some of them are
   marked with -I18N in the port name. These and many other programs have
   built in support for I18N and need no special consideration.

   However, some applications such as MySQL need to be have the Makefile
   configured with the specific charset. This is usually done in the Makefile
   or done by passing a value to configure in the source.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

14.5 Localizing DragonFly to Specific Languages

  14.5.1 Russian Language (KOI8-R Encoding)

   Originally contributed by Andrey A. Chernov.

   For more information about KOI8-R encoding, see the KOI8-R References
   (Russian Net Character Set).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.5.1.1 Locale Setup

   Put the following lines into your ~/.login_conf file:

 me:My Account:\
         :charset=KOI8-R:\
         :lang=ru_RU.KOI8-R:

   See earlier in this chapter for examples of setting up the locale.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.5.1.2 Console Setup

     * Add the following line to your kernel configuration file:

 options         SC_MOUSE_CHAR=0x03

       Insert the following line into /etc/rc.conf:

 mousechar_start=3

     * Use following settings in /etc/rc.conf:

 keymap="ru.koi8-r"
 scrnmap="koi8-r2cp866"
 font8x16="cp866b-8x16"
 font8x14="cp866-8x14"
 font8x8="cp866-8x8"

     * For each ttyv* entry in /etc/ttys, use cons25r as the terminal type.

   See earlier in this chapter for examples of setting up the console.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.5.1.3 Printer Setup

   Since most printers with Russian characters come with hardware code page
   CP866, a special output filter is needed to convert from KOI8-R to CP866.
   Such a filter is installed by default as /usr/libexec/lpr/ru/koi2alt. A
   Russian printer /etc/printcap entry should look like:

 lp|Russian local line printer:\
         :sh:of=/usr/libexec/lpr/ru/koi2alt:\
         :lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/output/lpd:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:

   See printcap(5) for a detailed description.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.5.1.4 MS-DOS(R) FS and Russian Filenames

   The following example fstab(5) entry enables support for Russian filenames
   in mounted MS-DOS filesystems:

 /dev/ad0s2      /dos/c  msdos   rw,-Wkoi2dos,-Lru_RU.KOI8-R 0 0

   The option -L selects the locale name used, and -W sets the character
   conversion table. To use the -W option, be sure to mount /usr before the
   MS-DOS partition because the conversion tables are located in
   /usr/libdata/msdosfs. For more informations, see the mount_msdos(8) manual
   page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    14.5.1.5 X11 Setup

    1. Do non-X locale setup first as described.

         Note: The Russian KOI8-R locale may not work with old XFree86
         releases (lower than 3.3). XFree86 4.X is now the default version of
         the X Window System on DragonFly. This should not be an issue unless
         you explicitly install an older version of XFree86.

    2. Go to the russian/X.language directory and issue the following
       command:

 # make install

       The above port installs the latest version of the KOI8-R fonts.
       XFree86 3.3 already has some KOI8-R fonts, but these are scaled
       better.

       Check the "Files" section in your /etc/XF86Config file. The following
       lines must be added before any other FontPath entries:

 FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic/misc"
 FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic/75dpi"
 FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic/100dpi"

       If you use a high resolution video mode, swap the 75 dpi and 100 dpi
       lines.

    3. To activate a Russian keyboard, add the following to the "Keyboard"
       section of your XF86Config file.

       For XFree86 3.X:

 XkbLayout  "ru"
 XkbOptions "grp:caps_toggle"

       For XFree86 4.X:

 Option "XkbLayout"   "ru"
 Option "XkbOptions"  "grp:caps_toggle"

       Also make sure that XkbDisable is turned off (commented out) there.

       The RUS/LAT switch will be CapsLock. The old CapsLock function is
       still available via Shift+CapsLock (in LAT mode only).

       If you have ``Windows'' keys on your keyboard, and notice that some
       non-alphabetical keys are mapped incorrectly in RUS mode, add the
       following line in your XF86Config file.

       For XFree86 3.X:

 XkbVariant "winkeys"

       For XFree86 4.X:

 Option "XkbVariant" "winkeys"

         Note: The Russian XKB keyboard may not work with old XFree86
         versions, see the above note for more information. The Russian XKB
         keyboard may also not work with non-localized applications as well.
         Minimally localized applications should call a XtSetLanguageProc
         (NULL, NULL, NULL); function early in the program. See KOI8-R for X
         Window for more instructions on localizing X11 applications.

  14.5.2 Traditional Chinese Localization for Taiwan

   The FreeBSD-Taiwan Project has an I18N/L10N tutorial for FreeBSD at
   http://freebsd.sinica.edu.tw/~ncvs/zh-l10n-tut/ using many Chinese ports.
   Much of that project can apply to DragonFly. The editor for the
   zh-L10N-tut is Clive Lin <Clive@CirX.org>. You can also cvsup the
   following collections at freebsd.sinica.edu.tw:

      Collection                           Description                        
   outta-port tag=.  Beta-quality ports collection for Chinese                
   zh-L10N-tut tag=. Localizing FreeBSD Tutorial in BIG-5 Traditional Chinese 
   zh-doc tag=.      FreeBSD Documentation Translation to BIG-5 Traditional   
                     Chinese                                                  

   Chuan-Hsing Shen <s874070@mail.yzu.edu.tw> has created the Chinese FreeBSD
   Collection (CFC) using FreeBSD-Taiwan's zh-L10N-tut. The packages and the
   script files are available at
   ftp://ftp.csie.ncu.edu.tw/OS/FreeBSD/taiwan/CFC/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.5.3 German Language Localization (for All ISO 8859-1 Languages)

   Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> wrote a tutorial how to use umlauts
   on a FreeBSD machine. The tutorial is written in German and available at
   http://www.de.FreeBSD.org/de/umlaute/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  14.5.4 Japanese and Korean Language Localization

   For Japanese, refer to http://www.jp.FreeBSD.org/, and for Korean, refer
   to http://www.kr.FreeBSD.org/.

  14.5.5 Non-English DragonFly Documentation

   Non-English documentation will be made available as it is created, at the
   main site or in /usr/share/doc.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Chapter 15 Desktop Applications

   Contributed by Christophe Juniet.

15.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly can run a wide variety of desktop applications, such as browsers
   and word processors. Most of these are available as packages or can be
   automatically built from the ports collection. Many new users expect to
   find these kinds of applications on their desktop. This chapter will show
   you how to install some popular desktop applications effortlessly, either
   from their packages or from the ports collection.

     Warning: This chapter contains a number of outdated references to the
     FreeBSD ports collection. Most instructions still apply to pkgsrc, but
     proceed with caution until this chapter is updated.

   Note that when installing programs from the ports, they are compiled from
   source. This can take a very long time, depending on what you are
   compiling and the processing power of your machine(s). If building from
   source takes a prohibitively long amount of time for you, you can install
   most of the programs of the ports collection from pre-built packages.

   As DragonFly features Linux binary compatibility, many applications
   originally developed for Linux are available for your desktop. It is
   strongly recommended that you read Chapter 22 before installing any of the
   Linux applications. Many of the ports using the Linux binary compatibility
   start with ``linux-''. Remember this when you search for a particular
   port, for instance with whereis(1). In the following text, it is assumed
   that you have enabled Linux binary compatibility before installing any of
   the Linux applications.

   Here are the categories covered by this chapter:

     * Browsers (such as Mozilla, Netscape, Opera)

     * Productivity (such as KOffice, AbiWord, The GIMP, OpenOffice.org)

     * Document Viewers (such as Acrobat Reader(R), gv, Xpdf, GQview)

     * Finance (such as GnuCash, Gnumeric, Abacus)

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to install additional third-party software (Chapter 4).

     * Know how to install additional Linux software (Chapter 22).

   For information on how to get a multimedia environment, read Chapter 16.
   If you want to set up and use electronic mail, please refer to Chapter 20.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

15.2 Browsers

   DragonFly does not come with a particular browser pre-installed. Instead,
   the www directory of the ports collection contains a lot of browsers ready
   to be installed. If you do not have time to compile everything (this can
   take a very long time in some cases) many of them are available as
   packages.

   KDE and GNOME already provide HTML browsers. Please refer to Section 5.7
   for more information on how to set up these complete desktops.

   If you are looking for light-weight browsers, you should investigate the
   ports collection for www/dillo, www/links, or www/w3m.

   This section covers these applications:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Application | Resources | Installation |      Major Dependencies       |
   |    Name     |  Needed   |  from Ports  |                               |
   |-------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------------|
   | Mozilla     | heavy     | heavy        | Gtk+                          |

   |             |           |              | linux-openmotif               |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.2.1 Mozilla

   Mozilla is perhaps the most suitable browser for your DragonFly Desktop.
   It is modern and stable. It features a very standards-compliant HTML
   display engine. It provides a mail and news reader. It even has a HTML
   composer if you plan to write some web pages yourself. Users of Netscape
   will recognize the similarities with Communicator suite, as both browsers
   shared the same basis.

   On slow machines, with a CPU speed less than 233MHz or with less than 64MB
   of RAM, Mozilla can be too resource-consuming to be fully usable. You may
   want to look at the Opera browser instead, described a little later in
   this chapter.

   The Mozilla package from the network by:

 # pkg_add mozilla

   If the package is not available, and you have enough time and disk space,
   you can get the source for Mozilla, compile it and install it on your
   system. This is accomplished by:

 # cd /usr/ports/www/mozilla
 # make install clean

   The Mozilla port ensures a correct initialization by running the chrome
   registry setup with root privileges. However, if you want to fetch some
   add-ons like mouse gestures, you must run Mozilla as root to get them
   properly installed.

   Once you have completed the installation of Mozilla, you do not need to be
   root any longer. You can start Mozilla as a browser by typing:

 % mozilla

   You can start it directly as a mail and news reader as shown below:

 % mozilla -mail

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.2.2 Mozilla, Java(TM), and Macromedia(R) Flash(TM)

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   Installing Mozilla is simple, but unfortunately installing Mozilla with
   support for add-ons like Java(TM) and Macromedia(R) Flash(TM) consumes
   both time and disk space.

   The first thing is to download the files which will be used with Mozilla.
   Take your current web browser up to
   http://www.sun.com/software/java2/download.html and create an account on
   their website. Remember to save the username and password from here as it
   may be needed in the future. Download a copy of the file
   j2sdk-1_3_1-src.tar.gz and place this in /usr/ports/distfiles/ as the port
   will not fetch it automatically. This is due to license restrictions.
   While we are here, download the ``java environment'' from
   http://java.sun.com/webapps/download/Display?BundleId=7905. The filename
   is j2sdk-1_3_1_08-linux-i586.bin and is large (about 25 megabytes!). Like
   before, this file must be placed into /usr/ports/distfiles/. Finally
   download a copy of the ``java patchkit'' from
   http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/ and place it into
   /usr/ports/distfiles/.

   Install the java/jdk13 port with the standard make install clean and then
   install the www/flashpluginwrapper port. This port requires
   emulators/linux_base which is a large port. True that other Flash plugins
   exist, however they have not worked for me.

   Install the www/mozilla port, if Mozilla is not already installed.

   Now copy the Flash plug-in files with:

 # cp /usr/local/lib/flash/libflashplayer.so \
         /usr/X11R6/lib/browser_plugins/libflashplayer_linux.so

 # cp /usr/local/lib/flash/ShockwaveFlash.class \
         /usr/X11R6/lib/browser_plugins/

   Now add the following lines to the top of (but right under #!/bin/sh)
   Mozilla startup script: /usr/X11R6/bin/mozilla.

 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libflashplayer.so.1
 export LD_PRELOAD

   This will enable the Flash plug-in.

   Now just start Mozilla with:

 % mozilla &

   And access the About Plug-ins option from the Help menu. A list should
   appear with all the currently available plugins. Java and Shockwave(R)
   Flash should both be listed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.2.3 Netscape(R)

   The ports collection contains several versions of the Netscape browser.
   Since the native FreeBSD ones contain a serious security bug, installing
   them is strongly discouraged. Instead, use a more recent Linux or DIGITAL
   UNIX version.

   The latest stable release of the Netscape browser is Netscape 7. It can be
   installed from the ports collection:

 # cd /usr/ports/www/netscape7
 # make install clean

   There are localized versions in the French, German, and Japanese
   categories.

     Caution: Netscape 4.x versions are not recommended because they are not
     compliant with today's standards. However, Netscape 7.x and newer
     versions are only available for the i386 platform.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.2.4 Opera

   Opera is a very fast, full-featured, and standards-compliant browser. It
   comes in a version that runs under Linux emulation. There is a no-cost
   version of the browser that displays advertising and an ad-free version
   that can be purchased on the Opera web site.

   To browse the Web with Opera, install the package:

 # pkg_add opera

   Some FTP sites do not have all the packages, but the same result can be
   obtained with the ports collection by typing:

 # cd /usr/ports/www/opera
 # make install clean

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

15.3 Productivity

   When it comes to productivity, new users often look for a good office
   suite or a friendly word processor. While some desktop environments like
   KDE already provide an office suite, there is no default application.
   DragonFly provides all that is needed, regardless of your desktop
   environment.

   This section covers these applications:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Application Name | Resources | Installation |    Major Dependencies    |
   |                  |  Needed   |  from Ports  |                          |
   |------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------------------|
   | KOffice          | light     | heavy        | KDE                      |
   |------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------------------|
   | AbiWord          | light     | light        | Gtk+ or GNOME            |
   |------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------------------|
   | The Gimp         | light     | heavy        | Gtk+                     |
   |------------------+-----------+--------------+--------------------------|
   | OpenOffice.org   | heavy     | huge         | GCC 3.1, JDK(TM) 1.3,    |
   |                  |           |              | Mozilla                  |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.3.1 KOffice

   The KDE community has provided its desktop environment with an office
   suite which can be used outside KDE. It includes the four standard
   components that can be found in other office suites. KWord is the word
   processor, KSpread is the spreadsheet program, KPresenter manages slide
   presentations, and Kontour lets you draw graphical documents.

   Before installing the latest KOffice, make sure you have an up-to-date
   version of KDE.

   To install KOffice as a package, issue the following command:

 # pkg_add koffice

   If the package is not available, you can use the ports collection. For
   instance, to install KOffice for KDE3, do:

 # cd /usr/ports/editors/koffice-kde3
 # make install clean

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.3.2 AbiWord

   AbiWord is a free word processing program similar in look and feel to
   Microsoft Word. It is suitable for typing papers, letters, reports, memos,
   and so forth. It is very fast, contains many features, and is very
   user-friendly.

   AbiWord can import or export many file formats, including some proprietary
   ones like Microsoft .doc.

   AbiWord is available as a package. You can install it by:

 # pkg_add AbiWord

   If the package is not available, it can be compiled from the ports
   collection. The ports collection should be more up to date. It can be done
   as follows:

 # cd /usr/ports/editors/AbiWord
 # make install clean

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.3.3 The GIMP

   For image authoring or picture retouching, The GIMP is a very
   sophisticated image manipulation program. It can be used as a simple paint
   program or as a quality photo retouching suite. It supports a large number
   of plug-ins and features a scripting interface. The GIMP can read and
   write a wide range of file formats. It supports interfaces with scanners
   and tablets.

   You can install the package by issuing this command:

 # pkg_add -r gimp

   If your FTP site does not have this package, you can use the ports
   collection. The graphics directory of the ports collection also contains
   The Gimp Manual. Here is how to get them installed:

 # cd /usr/ports/graphics/gimp1
 # make install clean
 # cd /usr/ports/graphics/gimp-manual-pdf
 # make install clean

     Note: The graphics directory of the ports collection holds the
     development version of The GIMP in graphics/gimp-devel. HTML and
     PostScript versions of The Gimp Manual are in graphics/gimp-manual-html
     and graphics/gimp-manual-ps.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  15.3.4 OpenOffice.org

   OpenOffice.org includes all of the mandatory applications in a complete
   office productivity suite: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation
   manager, and a drawing program. Its user interface is very similar to
   other office suites, and it can import and export in various popular file
   formats. It is available in a number of different languages including
   interfaces, spell checkers, and dictionaries.

   The word processor of OpenOffice.org uses a native XML file format for
   increased portability and flexibility. The spreadsheet program features a
   macro language and it can be interfaced with external databases.
   OpenOffice.org is already stable and runs natively on Windows,
   Solaris(TM), Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. More information about
   OpenOffice.org can be found on the OpenOffice web site. For FreeBSD
   specific information, and to directly download packages use the FreeBSD
   OpenOffice Porting Team's web site. These packages should work on
   DragonFly.

   To install OpenOffice.org, do:

 # pkg_add openoffice

   Once the package is installed, you must run the setup program and choose a
   standard workstation installation. Run this command as the user who will
   use OpenOffice.org:

 % openoffice-setup

   If the OpenOffice.org packages are not available, you still have the
   option to compile the port. However, you must bear in mind that it
   requires a lot of disk space and a fairly long time to compile.

 # cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice
 # make install clean

   Once this is done, run the setup as the user who will use OpenOffice.org
   and choose a standard workstation installation by:

 % cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice
 % make install-user

   If you want to use a localized version, here are the available ports:

   +------------------------------------+
   |  Language  |         Port          |

15.6 Summary

   DragonFly is quite ready for day-to-day use as a desktop. With several
   thousand applications available as packages or ports, you can build a
   perfect desktop that suits all your needs.

   Once you have achieved the installation of your desktop, you may want to
   go one step further with misc/instant-workstation. This ``meta-port''
   allows you to build a typical set of ports for a workstation. You can
   customize it by editing /usr/ports/misc/instant-workstation/Makefile.
   Follow the syntax used for the default set to add or remove ports, and
   build it with the usual procedure. Eventually, you will be able to create
   a big package that corresponds to your very own desktop and install it to
   your other workstations!

   Here is a quick review of all the desktop applications covered in this
   chapter:

                             Chapter 16 Multimedia

   Edited by Ross Lippert.

16.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly supports a wide variety of sound cards, allowing you to enjoy
   high fidelity output from your computer. This includes the ability to
   record and playback audio in the MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3), WAV, and Ogg
   Vorbis formats as well as many other formats. The pkgsrc collection also
   contain applications allowing you to edit your recorded audio, add sound
   effects, and control attached MIDI devices.

   With some willingness to experiment, DragonFly can support playback of
   video files and DVD's. The number of applications to encode, convert, and
   playback various video media is more limited than the number of sound
   applications. For example as of this writing, there is no good re-encoding
   application in the FreeBSD Ports Collection, which could be use to convert
   between formats, as there is with audio/sox. However, the software
   landscape in this area is changing rapidly.

   This chapter will describe the necessary steps to configure your sound
   card. The configuration and installation of X11 (Chapter 5) has already
   taken care of the hardware issues for your video card, though there may be
   some tweaks to apply for better playback.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to configure your system so that your sound card is recognized.

     * Methods to test that your card is working using sample applications.

     * How to troubleshoot your sound setup.

     * How to playback and encode MP3s and other audio.

     * How video is supported by the X server.

     * Some video player/encoder ports which give good results.

     * How to playback DVD's, .mpg and .avi files.

     * How to rip CD and DVD information into files.

     * How to configure a TV card.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to configure and install a new kernel (Chapter 9).

     Warning: Trying to mount audio CDs with the mount(8) command will result
     in an error, at least, and a kernel panic, at worst. These media have
     specialized encodings which differ from the usual ISO-filesystem.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

16.2 Setting Up the Sound Card

   Contributed by Moses Moore.

  16.2.1 Locating the Correct Device

   Before you begin, you should know the model of the card you have, the chip
   it uses, and whether it is a PCI or ISA card. DragonFly supports a wide
   variety of both PCI and ISA cards. If you do not see your card in the
   following list, check the pcm(4) manual page. This is not a complete list;
   however, it does list some of the most common cards.

     * Crystal 4237, 4236, 4232, 4231

     * Yamaha OPL-SAx

     * OPTi931

     * Ensoniq AudioPCI 1370/1371

     * ESS Solo-1/1E

     * NeoMagic 256AV/ZX

     * SoundBlaster(R) Pro, 16, 32, AWE64, AWE128, Live

     * Creative ViBRA16

     * Advanced Asound 100, 110, and Logic ALS120

     * ES 1868, 1869, 1879, 1888

     * Gravis UltraSound

     * Aureal Vortex 1 or 2

   To use your sound device, you will need to load the proper device driver.
   This may be accomplished in one of two ways. The easiest way is to simply
   load a kernel module for your sound card with kldload(8) which can either
   be done from the command line:

 # kldload snd_emu10k1.ko

   or by adding the appropriate line to the file /boot/loader.conf like this:

 snd_emu10k1_load="YES"

   These examples are for a Creative SoundBlaster Live! sound card. Other
   available loadable sound modules are listed in /boot/defaults/loader.conf.

   Alternatively, you may statically compile in support for your sound card
   in your kernel. The sections below provide the information you need to add
   support for your hardware in this manner. For more information about
   recompiling your kernel, please see Chapter 9.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.2.1.1 Creative, Advance, and ESS Sound Cards

   If you have one of the above cards, you will need to add:

 device pcm

   to your kernel configuration file. If you have a PnP ISA card, you will
   also need to add:

 device sbc

   For a non-PnP ISA card, add:

 device pcm
 device sbc0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 flags 0x15

   to your kernel configuration file. The settings shown above are the
   defaults. You may need to change the IRQ or the other settings to match
   your card. See the sbc(4) manual page for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.2.1.2 Gravis UltraSound Cards

   For a PnP ISA card, you will need to add:

 device pcm
 device gusc

   to your kernel configuration file. If you have a non-PnP ISA card, you
   will need to add:

 device pcm
 device gus0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 flags 0x13

   to your kernel configuration file. You may need to change the IRQ or the
   other settings to match your card. See the gusc(4) manual page for more
   information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.2.1.3 Crystal Sound Cards

   For Crystal cards, you will need to add:

 device pcm
 device csa

   to your kernel configuration file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.2.1.4 Generic Support

   For PnP ISA or PCI cards, you will need to add:

 device pcm

   to your kernel configuration file. If you have a non-PnP ISA sound card
   that does not have a bridge driver, you will need to add:

 device pcm0 at isa? irq 10 drq 1 flags 0x0

   to your kernel configuration file. You may need to change the IRQ or the
   other settings to match your card.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.2.1.5 Onboard Sound

   Some systems with built-in motherboard sound devices may require the
   following device in your kernel configuration:

 device pnpbios

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.2.2 Creating and Testing the Device Nodes

   After you reboot, log in and check for the device in the
   /var/run/dmesg.boot file, as shown below:

 # grep pcm /var/run/dmesg.boot
 pcm0: <SB16 DSP 4.11> on sbc0

   The output from your system may look different. If no pcm devices show up,
   something went wrong earlier. If that happens, go through your kernel
   configuration file again and make sure you chose the correct device.
   Common problems are listed in Section 16.2.2.1.

   If the previous command returned pcm0, you will have to run the following
   as root:

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV snd0

   If the command returned pcm1, follow the same steps as shown above,
   replacing snd0 with snd1.

     Note: The above commands will not create a /dev/snd device!

   MAKEDEV will create a group of device nodes, including:

       Device                  Description              
   /dev/audio     Sparc(R) compatible audio device      
   /dev/dsp       Digitized voice device                
   /dev/dspW      Like /dev/dsp, but 16 bits per sample 
   /dev/midi      Raw midi access device                
   /dev/mixer     Control port mixer device             
   /dev/music     Level 2 sequencer interface           
   /dev/sequencer Sequencer device                      
   /dev/pss       Programmable device interface         

   If all goes well, you should now have a functioning sound card. If your
   CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is properly coupled to your sound card, you can
   put a CD in the drive and play it with cdcontrol(1):

 % cdcontrol -f /dev/acd0c play 1

   Various applications, such as audio/workman offer a better interface. You
   may want to install an application such as audio/mpg123 to listen to MP3
   audio files.

  16.2.3 Utilizing Multiple Sound Sources

   Contributed by Munish Chopra.

   It is often desirable to have multiple sources of sound that are able to
   play simultaneously, such as when esound or artsd do not support sharing
   of the sound device with a certain application.

   DragonFly lets you do this through Virtual Sound Channels, which can be
   set with the sysctl(8) facility. Virtual channels allow you to multiplex
   your sound card's playback channels by mixing sound in the kernel.

   To set the number of virtual channels, there are two sysctl knobs which,
   if you are the root user, can be set like this:

 # sysctl hw.snd.pcm0.vchans=4
 # sysctl hw.snd.maxautovchans=4

   The above example allocates four virtual channels, which is a practical
   number for everyday use. hw.snd.pcm0.vchans is the number of virtual
   channels pcm0 has, and is configurable once a device has been attached.
   hw.snd.maxautovchans is the number of virtual channels a new audio device
   is given when it is attached using kldload(8). Since the pcm module can be
   loaded independently of the hardware drivers, hw.snd.maxautovchans can
   store how many virtual channels any devices which are attached later will
   be given.

   If you are not using devfs(5), you will have to point your applications at
   /dev/dsp0.x, where x is 0 to 3 if hw.snd.pcm.0.vchans is set to 4 as in
   the above example. On a system using devfs(5), the above will
   automatically be allocated transparently to the user.

16.3 MP3 Audio

   Contributed by Chern Lee.

   MP3 (MPEG Layer 3 Audio) accomplishes near CD-quality sound, leaving no
   reason to let your DragonFly workstation fall short of its offerings.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.3.1 MP3 Players

   A popular X11 MP3 player is XMMS (X Multimedia System). Winamp skins can
   be used with XMMS since the GUI is almost identical to that of Nullsoft's
   Winamp. XMMS also has native plug-in support.

   XMMS can be installed from the multimedia/xmms port or package.

   XMMS' interface is intuitive, with a playlist, graphic equalizer, and
   more. Those familiar with Winamp will find XMMS simple to use.

   The audio/mpg123 port is an alternative, command-line MP3 player.

   mpg123 can be run by specifying the sound device and the MP3 file on the
   command line, as shown below:

 # mpg123 -a /dev/dsp1.0 Foobar-GreatestHits.mp3
 High Performance MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 Audio Player for Layer 1, 2 and 3.
 Version 0.59r (1999/Jun/15). Written and copyrights by Michael Hipp.
 Uses code from various people. See 'README' for more!
 THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!





 Playing MPEG stream from Foobar-GreatestHits.mp3 ...
 MPEG 1.0 layer III, 128 kbit/s, 44100 Hz joint-stereo

   /dev/dsp1.0 should be replaced with the dsp device entry on your system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.3.2 Ripping CD Audio Tracks

   Before encoding a CD or CD track to MP3, the audio data on the CD must be
   ripped onto the hard drive. This is done by copying the raw CDDA (CD
   Digital Audio) data to WAV files.

   The cdda2wav tool, which is a part of the sysutils/cdrtools suite, is used
   for ripping audio information from CDs and the information associated with
   them.

   With the audio CD in the drive, the following command can be issued (as
   root) to rip an entire CD into individual (per track) WAV files:

 # cdda2wav -D 0,1,0 -B

   cdda2wav will support ATAPI (IDE) CDROM drives. To rip from an IDE drive,
   specify the device name in place of the SCSI unit numbers. For example, to
   rip track 7 from an IDE drive:

 # cdda2wav -D /dev/acd0a -t 7

   The -D 0,1,0 indicates the SCSI device 0,1,0, which corresponds to the
   output of cdrecord -scanbus.

   To rip individual tracks, make use of the -t option as shown:

 # cdda2wav -D 0,1,0 -t 7

   This example rips track seven of the audio CDROM. To rip a range of
   tracks, for example, track one to seven, specify a range:

 # cdda2wav -D 0,1,0 -t 1+7

   The utility dd(1) can also be used to extract audio tracks on ATAPI
   drives, read Section 12.5.5 for more information on that possibility.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.3.3 Encoding MP3s

   Nowadays, the mp3 encoder of choice is lame. Lame can be found at
   audio/lame in the pkgsrc and ports trees.

   Using the ripped WAV files, the following command will convert audio01.wav
   to audio01.mp3:

 # lame -h -b 128 \
 --tt "Foo Song Title" \
 --ta "FooBar Artist" \
 --tl "FooBar Album" \
 --ty "2001" \
 --tc "Ripped and encoded by Foo" \
 --tg "Genre" \
 audio01.wav audio01.mp3

   128 kbits seems to be the standard MP3 bitrate in use. Many enjoy the
   higher quality 160, or 192. The higher the bitrate, the more disk space
   the resulting MP3 will consume--but the quality will be higher. The -h
   option turns on the ``higher quality but a little slower'' mode. The
   options beginning with --t indicate ID3 tags, which usually contain song
   information, to be embedded within the MP3 file. Additional encoding
   options can be found by consulting the lame man page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.3.4 Decoding MP3s

   In order to burn an audio CD from MP3s, they must be converted to a
   non-compressed WAV format. Both XMMS and mpg123 support the output of MP3
   to an uncompressed file format.

   Writing to Disk in XMMS:

    1. Launch XMMS.

    2. Right-click on the window to bring up the XMMS menu.

    3. Select Preference under Options.

    4. Change the Output Plugin to ``Disk Writer Plugin''.

    5. Press Configure.

    6. Enter (or choose browse) a directory to write the uncompressed files
       to.

    7. Load the MP3 file into XMMS as usual, with volume at 100% and EQ
       settings turned off.

    8. Press Play -- XMMS will appear as if it is playing the MP3, but no
       music will be heard. It is actually playing the MP3 to a file.

    9. Be sure to set the default Output Plugin back to what it was before in
       order to listen to MP3s again.

   Writing to stdout in mpg123:

    1. Run mpg123 -s audio01.mp3 > audio01.pcm

   XMMS writes a file in the WAV format, while mpg123 converts the MP3 into
   raw PCM audio data. Both of these formats can be used with cdrecord to
   create audio CDs. You have to use raw PCM with burncd(8). If you use WAV
   files, you will notice a small tick sound at the beginning of each track,
   this sound is the header of the WAV file. You can simply remove the header
   of a WAV file with the utility SoX (it can be installed from the audio/sox
   port or package):

 % sox -t wav -r 44100 -s -w -c 2 track.wav track.raw

   Read Section 12.5 for more information on using a CD burner in DragonFly.

16.4 Video Playback

   Contributed by Ross Lippert.

   Video playback is a very new and rapidly developing application area. Be
   patient. Not everything is going to work as smoothly as it did with sound.

   Before you begin, you should know the model of the video card you have and
   the chip it uses. While XFree86 and X.org support a wide variety of video
   cards, fewer give good playback performance. To obtain a list of
   extensions supported by the X server using your card use the command
   xdpyinfo(1) while X11 is running.

   It is a good idea to have a short MPEG file which can be treated as a test
   file for evaluating various players and options. Since some DVD players
   will look for DVD media in /dev/dvd by default, or have this device name
   hardcoded in them, you might find it useful to make symbolic links to the
   proper devices:

 # ln -sf /dev/acd0c /dev/dvd
 # ln -sf /dev/racd0c /dev/rdvd

   Additionally, DVD decryption, which requires invoking special DVD-ROM
   functions, requires write permission on the DVD devices.

   Some of the packages discussed rely on the following kernel options to
   build correctly. Before attempting to build, add these options to the
   kernel configuration file, build a new kernel, and reboot:

 option CPU_ENABLE_SSE
 option USER_LDT

   To enhance the shared memory X11 interface, it is recommended that the
   values of some sysctl(8) variables should be increased:

 kern.ipc.shmmax=67108864
 kern.ipc.shmall=32768

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.4.1 Determining Video Capabilities

   There are several possible ways to display video under X11. What will
   really work is largely hardware dependent. Each method described below
   will have varying quality across different hardware. Secondly, the
   rendering of video in X11 is a topic receiving a lot of attention lately,
   and with each version of X.org or XFree86 there may be significant
   improvement.

   A list of common video interfaces:

    1. X11: normal X11 output using shared memory.

    2. XVideo: an extension to the X11 interface which supports video in any
       X11 drawable.

    3. SDL: the Simple Directmedia Layer.

    4. DGA: the Direct Graphics Access.

    5. SVGAlib: low level console graphics layer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.1.1 XVideo

   Both XFree86 4.X and X.org have an extension called XVideo (aka Xvideo,
   aka Xv, aka xv) which allows video to be directly displayed in drawable
   objects through a special acceleration. This extension provides very good
   quality playback even on low-end machines (for example my PIII 400 Mhz
   laptop). Unfortunately, the list of cards in which this feature is
   supported ``out of the box'' is currently:

    1. 3DFX Voodoo 3

    2. Intel i810 and i815

    3. some S3 chips (such as Savage/IX and Savage/MX)

   If your card is not one of these, do not be disappointed yet. XFree86 4.X
   adds new xv capabilities with each release [12]. To check whether the
   extension is running, use xvinfo:

 % xvinfo

   XVideo is supported for your card if the result looks like:

   Also note that the formats listed (YUV2, YUV12, etc) are not present with
   every implementation of XVideo and their absence may hinder some players.

   If the result looks like:

 X-Video Extension version 2.2
 screen #0
 no adaptors present

   Then XVideo is probably not supported for your card.

   If XVideo is not supported for your card, this only means that it will be
   more difficult for your display to meet the computational demands of
   rendering video. Depending on your video card and processor, though, you
   might still be able to have a satisfying experience. You should probably
   read about ways of improving performance in the advanced reading Section
   16.4.3.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.1.2 Simple Directmedia Layer

   The Simple Directmedia Layer, SDL, was intended to be a porting layer
   between Microsoft Windows, BeOS, and UNIX, allowing cross-platform
   applications to be developed which made efficient use of sound and
   graphics. The SDL layer provides a low-level abstraction to the hardware
   which can sometimes be more efficient than the X11 interface.

   The SDL can be found at devel/sdl12 (or pkgsrc/devel/SDL2).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.1.3 Direct Graphics Access

   Direct Graphics Access is an X11 extension which allows a program to
   bypass the X server and directly alter the framebuffer. Because it relies
   on a low level memory mapping to effect this sharing, programs using it
   must be run as root.

   The DGA extension can be tested and benchmarked by dga(1). When dga is
   running, it changes the colors of the display whenever a key is pressed.
   To quit, use q.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.4.2 Ports and Packages Dealing with Video

   This section discusses the software available from the pkgsrc collection
   which can be used for video playback. Video playback is a very active area
   of software development, and the capabilities of various applications are
   bound to diverge somewhat from the descriptions given here.

   Firstly, it is important to know that many of the video applications which
   run on DragonFly were developed as Linux applications. Many of these
   applications are still beta-quality. Some of the problems that you may
   encounter with video packages on DragonFly include:

    1. An application cannot playback a file which another application
       produced.

    2. An application cannot playback a file which the application itself
       produced.

    3. The same application on two different machines, rebuilt on each
       machine for that machine, plays back the same file differently.

    4. A seemingly trivial filter like rescaling of the image size results in
       very bad artifacts from a buggy rescaling routine.

    5. An application frequently dumps core.

    6. Documentation is not installed with the port and can be found either
       on the web or under the port's work directory.

   Many of these applications may also exhibit ``Linux-isms''. That is, there
   may be issues resulting from the way some standard libraries are
   implemented in the Linux distributions, or some features of the Linux
   kernel which have been assumed by the authors of the applications. These
   issues are not always noticed and worked around by the port maintainers,
   which can lead to problems like these:

    1. The use of /proc/cpuinfo to detect processor characteristics.

    2. A misuse of threads which causes a program to hang upon completion
       instead of truly terminating.

    3. Software not yet in the pkgsrc collection which is commonly used in
       conjunction with the application.

   So far, these application developers have been cooperative with port
   maintainers to minimize the work-arounds needed for port-ing.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.2.1 MPlayer

   MPlayer is a recently developed and rapidly developing video player. The
   goals of the MPlayer team are speed and flexibility on Linux and other
   Unices. The project was started when the team founder got fed up with bad
   playback performance on then available players. Some would say that the
   graphical interface has been sacrificed for a streamlined design. However,
   once you get used to the command line options and the key-stroke controls,
   it works very well.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      16.4.2.1.1 Building MPlayer

   MPlayer resides in multimedia/mplayer. MPlayer performs a variety of
   hardware checks during the build process, resulting in a binary which will
   not be portable from one system to another. Therefore, it is important to
   build it from ports and not to use a binary package. Additionally, a
   number of options can be specified in the make command line, as described
   at the start of the build.

 # cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer
 # make
 You can enable additional compilation optimizations
 by defining WITH_OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS
 You can enable GTK GUI by defining WITH_GUI.
 You can enable DVD support by defining WITH_DVD.
 You can enable SVGALIB support by defining WITH_SVGALIB.
 You can enable VORBIS sound support by defining WITH_VORBIS.
 You can enable XAnim DLL support by defining WITH_XANIM.

   If you have x11-toolkits/gtk12 installed, then you might as well enable
   the GUI. Otherwise, it is not worth the effort. If you intend to play
   (possibly CSS encoded) DVD's with MPlayer you must enable the DVD support
   option here [13]. Some reasonable options are:

 # make WITH_DVD=yes WITH_SVGALIB=yes

   As of this writing, the MPlayer port will build its HTML documentation and
   one executable, mplayer. It can also be made to build an encoder,
   mencoder, which is a tool for re-encoding video. A modification to the
   Makefile can enable it. It may be enabled by default in subsequent
   versions of the port.

   The HTML documentation for MPlayer is very informative. If the reader
   finds the information on video hardware and interfaces in this chapter
   lacking, the MPlayer documentation is a very thorough supplement. You
   should definitely take the time to read the MPlayer documentation if you
   are looking for information about video support in UNIX.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      16.4.2.1.2 Using MPlayer

   Any user of MPlayer must set up a .mplayer subdirectory of her home
   directory. To create this necessary subdirectory, you can type the
   following:

 % cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer
 % make install-user

   The command options for mplayer are listed in the manual page. For even
   more detail there is HTML documentation. In this section, we will describe
   only a few common uses.

   To play a file, such as testfile.avi, through one of the various video
   interfaces set the -vo option:

 % mplayer -vo xv testfile.avi

 % mplayer -vo sdl testfile.avi

 % mplayer -vo x11 testfile.avi

 # mplayer -vo dga testfile.avi

 # mplayer -vo 'sdl:dga' testfile.avi

   It is worth trying all of these options, as their relative performance
   depends on many factors and will vary significantly with hardware.

   To play from a DVD, replace the testfile.avi with -dvd N DEVICE where N is
   the title number to play and DEVICE is the device node for the DVD-ROM.
   For example, to play title 3 from /dev/dvd:

 # mplayer -vo dga -dvd 3 /dev/dvd

   To stop, pause, advance and so on, consult the keybindings, which are
   output by running mplayer -h or read the manual page.

   Additional important options for playback are: -fs -zoom which engages the
   fullscreen mode and -framedrop which helps performance.

   In order for the mplayer command line to not become too large, the user
   can create a file .mplayer/config and set default options there:

 vo=xv
 fs=yes
 zoom=yes

   Finally, mplayer can be used to rip a DVD title into a .vob file. To dump
   out the second title from a DVD, type this:

 # mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile out.vob -dvd 2 /dev/dvd

   The output file, out.vob, will be MPEG and can be manipulated by the other
   packages described in this section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      16.4.2.1.3 mencoder

   If you opt to install mencoder when you build MPlayer, be forewarned that
   it is still an experimental component. Before using mencoder it is a good
   idea to familiarize yourself with the options from the HTML documentation.
   There is a manual page, but it is not very useful without the HTML
   documentation. There are innumerable ways to improve quality, lower
   bitrate, and change formats, and some of these tricks may make the
   difference between good or bad performance. Here are a couple of examples
   to get you going. First a simple copy:

 % mencoder input.avi -oac copy -ovc copy -o output.avi

   Improper combinations of command line options can yield output files that
   are unplayable even by mplayer. Thus, if you just want to rip to a file,
   stick to the -dumpfile in mplayer.

   To convert input.avi to the MPEG4 codec with MPEG3 audio encoding
   (audio/lame is required):

 % mencoder input.avi -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=192 \
          -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq -o output.avi

   This has produced output playable by mplayer and xine.

   input.avi can be replaced with -dvd 1 /dev/dvd and run as root to
   re-encode a DVD title directly. Since you are likely to be dissatisfied
   with your results the first time around, it is recommended you dump the
   title to a file and work on the file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.2.2 The xine Video Player

   The xine video player is a project of wide scope aiming not only at being
   an all in one video solution, but also in producing a reusable base
   library and a modular executable which can be extended with plugins. It
   comes both as a package and as a port, multimedia/xine.

   The xine player is still very rough around the edges, but it is clearly
   off to a good start. In practice, xine requires either a fast CPU with a
   fast video card, or support for the XVideo extension. The GUI is usable,
   but a bit clumsy.

   As of this writing, there is no input module shipped with xine which will
   play CSS encoded DVD's. There are third party builds which do have modules
   for this built in them, but none of these are in the FreeBSD Ports
   Collection.

   Compared to MPlayer, xine does more for the user, but at the same time,
   takes some of the more fine-grained control away from the user. The xine
   video player performs best on XVideo interfaces.

   By default, xine player will start up in a graphical user interface. The
   menus can then be used to open a specific file:

 % xine

   Alternatively, it may be invoked to play a file immediately without the
   GUI with the command:

 % xine -g -p mymovie.avi

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    16.4.2.3 The transcode Utilities

   The software transcode is not a player, but a suite of tools for
   re-encoding .avi and .mpg files. With transcode, one has the ability to
   merge video files, repair broken files, using command line tools with
   stdin/stdout stream interfaces.

   Like MPlayer, transcode is very experimental software which must be build
   from ports or pkgsrc at multimedia/transcode. Using a great many options
   to the make command. I recommend:

 # make WITH_LIBMPEG2=yes

   If you plan to install multimedia/avifile, then add the WITH_AVIFILE
   option to your make command line, as shown here:

 # make WITH_AVIFILE=yes WITH_LIBMPEG2=yes

   Here are two examples of using transcode for video conversion which
   produce rescaled output. The first encodes the output to an openDIVX AVI
   file, while the second encodes to the much more portable MPEG format.

 % transcode -i input.vob -x vob -V -Z 320x240 \
 -y opendivx -N 0x55 -o output.avi

 % transcode -i input.vob -x vob -V -Z 320x240 \
 -y mpeg -N 0x55 -o output.tmp
 % tcmplex -o output.mpg -i output.tmp.m1v -p output.tmp.mpa -m 1

   There is a manual page for transcode, but there is little documentation
   for the various tc* utilities (such as tcmplex) which are also installed.
   However, the -h command line option can always be given to get curt usage
   instructions for a command.

   In comparison, transcode runs significantly slower than mencoder, but it
   has a better chance of producing a more widely playable file. MPEGs
   created by transcode have been known to play on Windows Media(R) Player
   and Apple's Quicktime(R), for example.

  16.4.3 Further Reading

   The various video software packages for DragonFly are developing rapidly.
   It is quite possible that in the near future many of the problems
   discussed here will have been resolved. In the mean time, those who want
   to get the very most out of DragonFly's A/V capabilities will have to
   cobble together knowledge from several FAQs and tutorials and use a few
   different applications. This section exists to give the reader pointers to
   such additional information.

   The MPlayer documentation is very technically informative. These documents
   should probably be consulted by anyone wishing to obtain a high level of
   expertise with UNIX video. The MPlayer mailing list is hostile to anyone
   who has not bothered to read the documentation, so if you plan on making
   bug reports to them, RTFM.

   The xine HOWTO contains a chapter on performance improvement which is
   general to all players.

   Finally, there are some other promising applications which the reader may
   try:

     * Avifile which is also a port multimedia/avifile.

     * Ogle which is also a port multimedia/ogle.

     * Xtheater

     * multimedia/dvdauthor, an open source package for authoring DVD
       content.

16.5 Setting Up TV Cards

   Original contribution by Josef El-Rayes. Enhanced and adapted by Marc
   Fonvieille.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.5.1 Introduction

   TV cards allow you to watch broadcast or cable TV on your computer. Most
   of them accept composite video via an RCA or S-video input and some of
   these cards come with a FM radio tuner.

   DragonFly provides support for PCI-based TV cards using a Brooktree
   Bt848/849/878/879 or a Conexant CN-878/Fusion 878a Video Capture Chip with
   the bktr(4) driver. You must also ensure the board comes with a supported
   tuner, consult the bktr(4) manual page for a list of supported tuners.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.5.2 Adding the Driver

   To use your card, you will need to load the bktr(4) driver, this can be
   done by adding the following line to the /boot/loader.conf file like this:

 bktr_load="YES"

   Alternatively, you may statically compile the support for the TV card in
   your kernel, in that case add the following lines to your kernel
   configuration:

 device   bktr
 device  iicbus
 device  iicbb
 device  smbus

   These additional device drivers are necessary because of the card
   components being interconnected via an I2C bus. Then build and install a
   new kernel.

   Once the support was added to your system, you have to reboot your
   machine. During the boot process, your TV card should show up, like this:

 bktr0: <BrookTree 848A> mem 0xd7000000-0xd7000fff irq 10 at device 10.0 on pci0
 iicbb0: <I2C bit-banging driver> on bti2c0
 iicbus0: <Philips I2C bus> on iicbb0 master-only
 iicbus1: <Philips I2C bus> on iicbb0 master-only
 smbus0: <System Management Bus> on bti2c0
 bktr0: Pinnacle/Miro TV, Philips SECAM tuner.

   Of course these messages can differ according to your hardware. However
   you should check if the tuner is correctly detected; it is still possible
   to override some of the detected parameters with sysctl(8) MIBs and kernel
   configuration file options. For example, if you want to force the tuner to
   a Philips SECAM tuner, you should add the following line to your kernel
   configuration file:

 options OVERRIDE_TUNER=6

   or you can directly use sysctl(8):

 # sysctl hw.bt848.tuner=6

   See the bktr(4) manual page and the /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT file for
   more details on the available options.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.5.3 Useful Applications

   To use your TV card you need to install one of the following applications:

     * multimedia/fxtv provides TV-in-a-window and image/audio/video capture
       capabilities.

     * multimedia/xawtv is also a TV application, with the same features as
       fxtv.

     * misc/alevt (or pkgsrc/multimedia/alevt) decodes and displays
       Videotext/Teletext.

     * audio/xmradio, an application to use the FM radio tuner coming with
       some TV cards.

     * audio/wmtune, a handy desktop application for radio tuners.

   More applications are available in the pkgsrc and FreeBSD Ports
   collections.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  16.5.4 Troubleshooting

   If you encounter any problem with your TV card, you should check at first
   if the video capture chip and the tuner are really supported by the
   bktr(4) driver and if you used the right configuration options. For more
   support and various questions about your TV card you may want to contact
   and use the archives of the freebsd-multimedia mailing list.

                        Chapter 17 Serial Communications

17.1 Synopsis

   UNIX has always had support for serial communications. In fact, the very
   first UNIX machines relied on serial lines for user input and output.
   Things have changed a lot from the days when the average ``terminal''
   consisted of a 10-character-per-second serial printer and a keyboard. This
   chapter will cover some of the ways in which DragonFly uses serial
   communications.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to connect terminals to your DragonFly system.

     * How to use a modem to dial out to remote hosts.

     * How to allow remote users to login to your system with a modem.

     * How to boot your system from a serial console.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to configure and install a new kernel (Chapter 9).

     * Understand UNIX permissions and processes (Chapter 3).

     * Have access to the technical manual for the serial hardware (modem or
       multi-port card) that you would like to use with DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

17.2 Introduction

  17.2.1 Terminology

   bps

           Bits per Second -- the rate at which data is transmitted

   DTE

           Data Terminal Equipment -- for example, your computer

   DCE

           Data Communications Equipment -- your modem

   RS-232

           EIA standard for hardware serial communications

   When talking about communications data rates, this section does not use
   the term ``baud''. Baud refers to the number of electrical state
   transitions that may be made in a period of time, while ``bps'' (bits per
   second) is the correct term to use (at least it does not seem to bother
   the curmudgeons quite as much).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.2.2 Cables and Ports

   To connect a modem or terminal to your DragonFly system, you will need a
   serial port on your computer and the proper cable to connect to your
   serial device. If you are already familiar with your hardware and the
   cable it requires, you can safely skip this section.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.2.2.1 Cables

   There are several different kinds of serial cables. The two most common
   types for our purposes are null-modem cables and standard (``straight'')
   RS-232 cables. The documentation for your hardware should describe the
   type of cable required.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.2.2.1.1 Null-modem Cables

   A null-modem cable passes some signals, such as ``signal ground'',
   straight through, but switches other signals. For example, the ``send
   data'' pin on one end goes to the ``receive data'' pin on the other end.

   If you like making your own cables, you can construct a null-modem cable
   for use with terminals. This table shows the RS-232C signal names and the
   pin numbers on a DB-25 connector.

   Signal Pin #             Pin # Signal 
   SG     7     connects to 7     SG     
   TxD    2     connects to 3     RxD    
   RxD    3     connects to 2     TxD    
   RTS    4     connects to 5     CTS    
   CTS    5     connects to 4     RTS    
   DTR    20    connects to 6     DSR    
   DCD    8                 6     DSR    
   DSR    6     connects to 20    DTR    

     Note: Connect ``Data Set Ready'' (DSR) and ``Data Carrier Detect'' (DCD)
     internally in the connector hood, and then to ``Data Terminal Ready''
     (DTR) in the remote hood.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.2.2.1.2 Standard RS-232C Cables

   A standard serial cable passes all the RS-232C signals straight-through.
   That is, the ``send data'' pin on one end of the cable goes to the ``send
   data'' pin on the other end. This is the type of cable to use to connect a
   modem to your DragonFly system, and is also appropriate for some
   terminals.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.2.2.2 Ports

   Serial ports are the devices through which data is transferred between the
   DragonFly host computer and the terminal. This section describes the kinds
   of ports that exist and how they are addressed in DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.2.2.2.1 Kinds of Ports

   Several kinds of serial ports exist. Before you purchase or construct a
   cable, you need to make sure it will fit the ports on your terminal and on
   the DragonFly system.

   Most terminals will have DB25 ports. Personal computers, including PCs
   running DragonFly, will have DB25 or DB9 ports. If you have a multiport
   serial card for your PC, you may have RJ-12 or RJ-45 ports.

   See the documentation that accompanied the hardware for specifications on
   the kind of port in use. A visual inspection of the port often works too.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.2.2.2.2 Port Names

   In DragonFly, you access each serial port through an entry in the /dev
   directory. There are two different kinds of entries:

     * Call-in ports are named /dev/ttydN where N is the port number,
       starting from zero. Generally, you use the call-in port for terminals.
       Call-in ports require that the serial line assert the data carrier
       detect (DCD) signal to work correctly.

     * Call-out ports are named /dev/cuaaN. You usually do not use the
       call-out port for terminals, just for modems. You may use the call-out
       port if the serial cable or the terminal does not support the carrier
       detect signal.

   If you have connected a terminal to the first serial port (COM1 in
   MS-DOS), then you will use /dev/ttyd0 to refer to the terminal. If the
   terminal is on the second serial port (also known as COM2), use
   /dev/ttyd1, and so forth.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.2.3 Kernel Configuration

   DragonFly supports four serial ports by default. In the MS-DOS world,
   these are known as COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4. DragonFly currently
   supports ``dumb'' multiport serial interface cards, such as the BocaBoard
   1008 and 2016, as well as more intelligent multi-port cards such as those
   made by Digiboard and Stallion Technologies. However, the default kernel
   only looks for the standard COM ports.

   To see if your kernel recognizes any of your serial ports, watch for
   messages while the kernel is booting, or use the /sbin/dmesg command to
   replay the kernel's boot messages. In particular, look for messages that
   start with the characters sio.

     Tip: To view just the messages that have the word sio, use the command:

 # /sbin/dmesg | grep 'sio'

   For example, on a system with four serial ports, these are the serial-port
   specific kernel boot messages:

 sio0 at 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 on isa
 sio0: type 16550A
 sio1 at 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on isa
 sio1: type 16550A
 sio2 at 0x3e8-0x3ef irq 5 on isa
 sio2: type 16550A
 sio3 at 0x2e8-0x2ef irq 9 on isa
 sio3: type 16550A

   If your kernel does not recognize all of your serial ports, you will
   probably need to configure a custom DragonFly kernel for your system. For
   detailed information on configuring your kernel, please see Chapter 9.

   The relevant device lines for your kernel configuration file would look
   like this:

 device          sio0    at isa? port IO_COM1 irq 4
 device          sio1    at isa? port IO_COM2 irq 3
 device          sio2    at isa? port IO_COM3 irq 5
 device          sio3    at isa? port IO_COM4 irq 9

   You can comment-out or completely remove lines for devices you do not
   have. Please refer to the sio(4) manual page for more information on
   serial ports and multiport boards configuration.

     Note: port IO_COM1 is a substitution for port 0x3f8, IO_COM2 is 0x2f8,
     IO_COM3 is 0x3e8, and IO_COM4 is 0x2e8, which are fairly common port
     addresses for their respective serial ports; interrupts 4, 3, 5, and 9
     are fairly common interrupt request lines. Also note that regular serial
     ports cannot share interrupts on ISA-bus PCs (multiport boards have
     on-board electronics that allow all the 16550A's on the board to share
     one or two interrupt request lines).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.2.4 Device Special Files

   Most devices in the kernel are accessed through ``device special files'',
   which are located in the /dev directory. The sio devices are accessed
   through the /dev/ttydN (dial-in) and /dev/cuaaN (call-out) devices.
   DragonFly also provides initialization devices (/dev/ttyidN and
   /dev/cuaiaN) and locking devices (/dev/ttyldN and /dev/cualaN). The
   initialization devices are used to initialize communications port
   parameters each time a port is opened, such as crtscts for modems which
   use RTS/CTS signaling for flow control. The locking devices are used to
   lock flags on ports to prevent users or programs changing certain
   parameters; see the manual pages termios(4), sio(4), and stty(1) for
   information on the terminal settings, locking and initializing devices,
   and setting terminal options, respectively.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.2.4.1 Making Device Special Files

   A shell script called MAKEDEV in the /dev directory manages the device
   special files. To use MAKEDEV to make dial-up device special files for
   COM1 (port 0), cd to /dev and issue the command MAKEDEV ttyd0. Likewise,
   to make dial-up device special files for COM2 (port 1), use MAKEDEV ttyd1.

   MAKEDEV not only creates the /dev/ttydN device special files, but also the
   /dev/cuaaN, /dev/cuaiaN, /dev/cualaN, /dev/ttyldN, and /dev/ttyidN nodes.

   After making new device special files, be sure to check the permissions on
   the files (especially the /dev/cua* files) to make sure that only users
   who should have access to those device special files can read and write on
   them -- you probably do not want to allow your average user to use your
   modems to dial-out. The default permissions on the /dev/cua* files should
   be sufficient:

 crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 129 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cuaa1
 crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 161 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cuaia1
 crw-rw----    1 uucp     dialer    28, 193 Feb 15 14:38 /dev/cuala1

   These permissions allow the user uucp and users in the group dialer to use
   the call-out devices.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.2.5 Serial Port Configuration

   The ttydN (or cuaaN) device is the regular device you will want to open
   for your applications. When a process opens the device, it will have a
   default set of terminal I/O settings. You can see these settings with the
   command

 # stty -a -f /dev/ttyd1

   When you change the settings to this device, the settings are in effect
   until the device is closed. When it is reopened, it goes back to the
   default set. To make changes to the default set, you can open and adjust
   the settings of the ``initial state'' device. For example, to turn on
   CLOCAL mode, 8 bit communication, and XON/XOFF flow control by default for
   ttyd5, type:

 # stty -f /dev/ttyid5 clocal cs8 ixon ixoff

   System-wide initialization of the serial devices is controlled in
   /etc/rc.serial. This file affects the default settings of serial devices.

   To prevent certain settings from being changed by an application, make
   adjustments to the ``lock state'' device. For example, to lock the speed
   of ttyd5 to 57600 bps, type:

 # stty -f /dev/ttyld5 57600

   Now, an application that opens ttyd5 and tries to change the speed of the
   port will be stuck with 57600 bps.

   Naturally, you should make the initial state and lock state devices
   writable only by the root account.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

17.3 Terminals

   Contributed by Sean Kelly.

   Terminals provide a convenient and low-cost way to access your DragonFly
   system when you are not at the computer's console or on a connected
   network. This section describes how to use terminals with DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.3.1 Uses and Types of Terminals

   The original UNIX systems did not have consoles. Instead, people logged in
   and ran programs through terminals that were connected to the computer's
   serial ports. It is quite similar to using a modem and terminal software
   to dial into a remote system to do text-only work.

   Today's PCs have consoles capable of high quality graphics, but the
   ability to establish a login session on a serial port still exists in
   nearly every UNIX style operating system today; DragonFly is no exception.
   By using a terminal attached to an unused serial port, you can log in and
   run any text program that you would normally run on the console or in an
   xterm window in the X Window System.

   For the business user, you can attach many terminals to a DragonFly system
   and place them on your employees' desktops. For a home user, a spare
   computer such as an older IBM PC or a Macintosh can be a terminal wired
   into a more powerful computer running DragonFly. You can turn what might
   otherwise be a single-user computer into a powerful multiple user system.

   For DragonFly, there are three kinds of terminals:

     * Dumb terminals

     * PCs acting as terminals

     * X terminals

   The remaining subsections describe each kind.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.1.1 Dumb Terminals

   Dumb terminals are specialized pieces of hardware that let you connect to
   computers over serial lines. They are called ``dumb'' because they have
   only enough computational power to display, send, and receive text. You
   cannot run any programs on them. It is the computer to which you connect
   them that has all the power to run text editors, compilers, email, games,
   and so forth.

   There are hundreds of kinds of dumb terminals made by many manufacturers,
   including Digital Equipment Corporation's VT-100 and Wyse's WY-75. Just
   about any kind will work with DragonFly. Some high-end terminals can even
   display graphics, but only certain software packages can take advantage of
   these advanced features.

   Dumb terminals are popular in work environments where workers do not need
   access to graphical applications such as those provided by the X Window
   System.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.1.2 PCs Acting as Terminals

   If a dumb terminal has just enough ability to display, send, and receive
   text, then certainly any spare personal computer can be a dumb terminal.
   All you need is the proper cable and some terminal emulation software to
   run on the computer.

   Such a configuration is popular in homes. For example, if your spouse is
   busy working on your DragonFly system's console, you can do some text-only
   work at the same time from a less powerful personal computer hooked up as
   a terminal to the DragonFly system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.1.3 X Terminals

   X terminals are the most sophisticated kind of terminal available. Instead
   of connecting to a serial port, they usually connect to a network like
   Ethernet. Instead of being relegated to text-only applications, they can
   display any X application.

   We introduce X terminals just for the sake of completeness. However, this
   chapter does not cover setup, configuration, or use of X terminals.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.3.2 Configuration

   This section describes what you need to configure on your DragonFly system
   to enable a login session on a terminal. It assumes you have already
   configured your kernel to support the serial port to which the terminal is
   connected--and that you have connected it.

   Recall from Chapter 7 that the init process is responsible for all process
   control and initialization at system startup. One of the tasks performed
   by init is to read the /etc/ttys file and start a getty process on the
   available terminals. The getty process is responsible for reading a login
   name and starting the login program.

   Thus, to configure terminals for your DragonFly system the following steps
   should be taken as root:

    1. Add a line to /etc/ttys for the entry in the /dev directory for the
       serial port if it is not already there.

    2. Specify that /usr/libexec/getty be run on the port, and specify the
       appropriate getty type from the /etc/gettytab file.

    3. Specify the default terminal type.

    4. Set the port to ``on.''

    5. Specify whether the port should be ``secure.''

    6. Force init to reread the /etc/ttys file.

   As an optional step, you may wish to create a custom getty type for use in
   step 2 by making an entry in /etc/gettytab. This chapter does not explain
   how to do so; you are encouraged to see the gettytab(5) and the getty(8)
   manual pages for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.2.1 Adding an Entry to /etc/ttys

   The /etc/ttys file lists all of the ports on your DragonFly system where
   you want to allow logins. For example, the first virtual console ttyv0 has
   an entry in this file. You can log in on the console using this entry.
   This file also contains entries for the other virtual consoles, serial
   ports, and pseudo-ttys. For a hardwired terminal, just list the serial
   port's /dev entry without the /dev part (for example, /dev/ttyv0 would be
   listed as ttyv0).

   A default DragonFly install includes an /etc/ttys file with support for
   the first four serial ports: ttyd0 through ttyd3. If you are attaching a
   terminal to one of those ports, you do not need to add another entry.

   Example 17-1. Adding Terminal Entries to /etc/ttys

   Suppose we would like to connect two terminals to the system: a Wyse-50
   and an old 286 IBM PC running Procomm terminal software emulating a VT-100
   terminal. We connect the Wyse to the second serial port and the 286 to the
   sixth serial port (a port on a multiport serial card). The corresponding
   entries in the /etc/ttys file would look like this:

 ttyd1(1)  "/usr/libexec/getty std.38400"(2)  wy50(3)  on(4)  insecure(5)
 ttyd5   "/usr/libexec/getty std.19200"  vt100  on  insecure
          

   (1)
           The first field normally specifies the name of the terminal
           special file as it is found in /dev.
   (2)
           The second field is the command to execute for this line, which is
           usually getty(8). getty initializes and opens the line, sets the
           speed, prompts for a user name and then executes the login(1)
           program.

           The getty program accepts one (optional) parameter on its command
           line, the getty type. A getty type configures characteristics on
           the terminal line, like bps rate and parity. The getty program
           reads these characteristics from the file /etc/gettytab.

           The file /etc/gettytab contains lots of entries for terminal lines
           both old and new. In almost all cases, the entries that start with
           the text std will work for hardwired terminals. These entries
           ignore parity. There is a std entry for each bps rate from 110 to
           115200. Of course, you can add your own entries to this file. The
           gettytab(5) manual page provides more information.

           When setting the getty type in the /etc/ttys file, make sure that
           the communications settings on the terminal match.

           For our example, the Wyse-50 uses no parity and connects at
           38400 bps. The 286 PC uses no parity and connects at 19200 bps.

   (3)
           The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
           tty line. For dial-up ports, unknown or dialup is typically used
           in this field since users may dial up with practically any type of
           terminal or software. For hardwired terminals, the terminal type
           does not change, so you can put a real terminal type from the
           termcap(5) database file in this field.

           For our example, the Wyse-50 uses the real terminal type while the
           286 PC running Procomm will be set to emulate at VT-100.

   (4)
           The fourth field specifies if the port should be enabled. Putting
           on here will have the init process start the program in the second
           field, getty. If you put off in this field, there will be no
           getty, and hence no logins on the port.
   (5)
           The final field is used to specify whether the port is secure.
           Marking a port as secure means that you trust it enough to allow
           the root account (or any account with a user ID of 0) to login
           from that port. Insecure ports do not allow root logins. On an
           insecure port, users must login from unprivileged accounts and
           then use su(1) or a similar mechanism to gain superuser
           privileges.

           It is highly recommended that you use ``insecure'' even for
           terminals that are behind locked doors. It is quite easy to login
           and use su if you need superuser privileges.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.2.2 Force init to Reread /etc/ttys

   After making the necessary changes to the /etc/ttys file you should send a
   SIGHUP (hangup) signal to the init process to force it to re-read its
   configuration file. For example:

 # kill -HUP 1

     Note: init is always the first process run on a system, therefore it
     will always have PID 1.

   If everything is set up correctly, all cables are in place, and the
   terminals are powered up, then a getty process should be running on each
   terminal and you should see login prompts on your terminals at this point.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.3.3 Troubleshooting Your Connection

   Even with the most meticulous attention to detail, something could still
   go wrong while setting up a terminal. Here is a list of symptoms and some
   suggested fixes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.3.1 No Login Prompt Appears

   Make sure the terminal is plugged in and powered up. If it is a personal
   computer acting as a terminal, make sure it is running terminal emulation
   software on the correct serial port.

   Make sure the cable is connected firmly to both the terminal and the
   DragonFly computer. Make sure it is the right kind of cable.

   Make sure the terminal and DragonFly agree on the bps rate and parity
   settings. If you have a video display terminal, make sure the contrast and
   brightness controls are turned up. If it is a printing terminal, make sure
   paper and ink are in good supply.

   Make sure that a getty process is running and serving the terminal. For
   example, to get a list of running getty processes with ps, type:

 # ps -axww|grep getty

   You should see an entry for the terminal. For example, the following
   display shows that a getty is running on the second serial port ttyd1 and
   is using the std.38400 entry in /etc/gettytab:

 22189  d1  Is+    0:00.03 /usr/libexec/getty std.38400 ttyd1

   If no getty process is running, make sure you have enabled the port in
   /etc/ttys. Also remember to run kill -HUP 1 after modifying the ttys file.

   If the getty process is running but the terminal still does not display a
   login prompt, or if it displays a prompt but will not allow you to type,
   your terminal or cable may not support hardware handshaking. Try changing
   the entry in /etc/ttys from std.38400 to 3wire.38400 remember to run kill
   -HUP 1 after modifying /etc/ttys). The 3wire entry is similar to std, but
   ignores hardware handshaking. You may need to reduce the baud rate or
   enable software flow control when using 3wire to prevent buffer overflows.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.3.2 If Garbage Appears Instead of a Login Prompt

   Make sure the terminal and DragonFly agree on the bps rate and parity
   settings. Check the getty processes to make sure the correct getty type is
   in use. If not, edit /etc/ttys and run kill -HUP 1.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.3.3.3 Characters Appear Doubled; the Password Appears When Typed

   Switch the terminal (or the terminal emulation software) from ``half
   duplex'' or ``local echo'' to ``full duplex.''

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

17.4 Dial-in Service

   Contributed by Guy Helmer. Additions by Sean Kelly.

   Configuring your DragonFly system for dial-in service is very similar to
   connecting terminals except that you are dealing with modems instead of
   terminals.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.1 External vs. Internal Modems

   External modems seem to be more convenient for dial-up, because external
   modems often can be semi-permanently configured via parameters stored in
   non-volatile RAM and they usually provide lighted indicators that display
   the state of important RS-232 signals. Blinking lights impress visitors,
   but lights are also very useful to see whether a modem is operating
   properly.

   Internal modems usually lack non-volatile RAM, so their configuration may
   be limited only to setting DIP switches. If your internal modem has any
   signal indicator lights, it is probably difficult to view the lights when
   the system's cover is in place.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.1.1 Modems and Cables

   If you are using an external modem, then you will of course need the
   proper cable. A standard RS-232C serial cable should suffice as long as
   all of the normal signals are wired:

     * Transmitted Data (SD)

     * Received Data (RD)

     * Request to Send (RTS)

     * Clear to Send (CTS)

     * Data Set Ready (DSR)

     * Data Terminal Ready (DTR)

     * Carrier Detect (CD)

     * Signal Ground (SG)

   DragonFly needs the RTS and CTS signals for flow-control at speeds above
   2400 bps, the CD signal to detect when a call has been answered or the
   line has been hung up, and the DTR signal to reset the modem after a
   session is complete. Some cables are wired without all of the needed
   signals, so if you have problems, such as a login session not going away
   when the line hangs up, you may have a problem with your cable.

   Like other UNIX like operating systems, DragonFly uses the hardware
   signals to find out when a call has been answered or a line has been hung
   up and to hangup and reset the modem after a call. DragonFly avoids
   sending commands to the modem or watching for status reports from the
   modem. If you are familiar with connecting modems to PC-based bulletin
   board systems, this may seem awkward.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.2 Serial Interface Considerations

   DragonFly supports NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550-, and NS16550A-based EIA
   RS-232C (CCITT V.24) communications interfaces. The 8250 and 16450 devices
   have single-character buffers. The 16550 device provides a 16-character
   buffer, which allows for better system performance. (Bugs in plain 16550's
   prevent the use of the 16-character buffer, so use 16550A's if possible).
   Because single-character-buffer devices require more work by the operating
   system than the 16-character-buffer devices, 16550A-based serial interface
   cards are much preferred. If the system has many active serial ports or
   will have a heavy load, 16550A-based cards are better for low-error-rate
   communications.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.3 Quick Overview

   As with terminals, init spawns a getty process for each configured serial
   port for dial-in connections. For example, if a modem is attached to
   /dev/ttyd0, the command ps ax might show this:

  4850 ??  I      0:00.09 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0

   When a user dials the modem's line and the modems connect, the CD (Carrier
   Detect) line is reported by the modem. The kernel notices that carrier has
   been detected and completes getty's open of the port. getty sends a login:
   prompt at the specified initial line speed. getty watches to see if
   legitimate characters are received, and, in a typical configuration, if it
   finds junk (probably due to the modem's connection speed being different
   than getty's speed), getty tries adjusting the line speeds until it
   receives reasonable characters.

   After the user enters his/her login name, getty executes /usr/bin/login,
   which completes the login by asking for the user's password and then
   starting the user's shell.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.4 Configuration Files

   There are three system configuration files in the /etc directory that you
   will probably need to edit to allow dial-up access to your DragonFly
   system. The first, /etc/gettytab, contains configuration information for
   the /usr/libexec/getty daemon. Second, /etc/ttys holds information that
   tells /sbin/init what tty devices should have getty processes running on
   them. Lastly, you can place port initialization commands in the
   /etc/rc.serial script.

   There are two schools of thought regarding dial-up modems on UNIX. One
   group likes to configure their modems and systems so that no matter at
   what speed a remote user dials in, the local computer-to-modem RS-232
   interface runs at a locked speed. The benefit of this configuration is
   that the remote user always sees a system login prompt immediately. The
   downside is that the system does not know what a user's true data rate is,
   so full-screen programs like Emacs will not adjust their screen-painting
   methods to make their response better for slower connections.

   The other school configures their modems' RS-232 interface to vary its
   speed based on the remote user's connection speed. For example, V.32bis
   (14.4 Kbps) connections to the modem might make the modem run its RS-232
   interface at 19.2 Kbps, while 2400 bps connections make the modem's RS-232
   interface run at 2400 bps. Because getty does not understand any
   particular modem's connection speed reporting, getty gives a login:
   message at an initial speed and watches the characters that come back in
   response. If the user sees junk, it is assumed that they know they should
   press the Enter key until they see a recognizable prompt. If the data
   rates do not match, getty sees anything the user types as ``junk'', tries
   going to the next speed and gives the login: prompt again. This procedure
   can continue ad nauseam, but normally only takes a keystroke or two before
   the user sees a good prompt. Obviously, this login sequence does not look
   as clean as the former ``locked-speed'' method, but a user on a low-speed
   connection should receive better interactive response from full-screen
   programs.

   This section will try to give balanced configuration information, but is
   biased towards having the modem's data rate follow the connection rate.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.4.1 /etc/gettytab

   /etc/gettytab is a termcap(5)-style file of configuration information for
   getty(8). Please see the gettytab(5) manual page for complete information
   on the format of the file and the list of capabilities.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.4.4.1.1 Locked-speed Config

   If you are locking your modem's data communications rate at a particular
   speed, you probably will not need to make any changes to /etc/gettytab.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.4.4.1.2 Matching-speed Config

   You will need to set up an entry in /etc/gettytab to give getty
   information about the speeds you wish to use for your modem. If you have a
   2400 bps modem, you can probably use the existing D2400 entry.

 #
 # Fast dialup terminals, 2400/1200/300 rotary (can start either way)
 #
 D2400|d2400|Fast-Dial-2400:\
         :nx=D1200:tc=2400-baud:
 3|D1200|Fast-Dial-1200:\
         :nx=D300:tc=1200-baud:
 5|D300|Fast-Dial-300:\
         :nx=D2400:tc=300-baud:

   If you have a higher speed modem, you will probably need to add an entry
   in /etc/gettytab; here is an entry you could use for a 14.4 Kbps modem
   with a top interface speed of 19.2 Kbps:

 #
 # Additions for a V.32bis Modem
 #
 um|V300|High Speed Modem at 300,8-bit:\
         :nx=V19200:tc=std.300:
 un|V1200|High Speed Modem at 1200,8-bit:\
         :nx=V300:tc=std.1200:
 uo|V2400|High Speed Modem at 2400,8-bit:\
         :nx=V1200:tc=std.2400:
 up|V9600|High Speed Modem at 9600,8-bit:\
         :nx=V2400:tc=std.9600:
 uq|V19200|High Speed Modem at 19200,8-bit:\
         :nx=V9600:tc=std.19200:

   This will result in 8-bit, no parity connections.

   The example above starts the communications rate at 19.2 Kbps (for a
   V.32bis connection), then cycles through 9600 bps (for V.32), 2400 bps,
   1200 bps, 300 bps, and back to 19.2 Kbps. Communications rate cycling is
   implemented with the nx= (``next table'') capability. Each of the lines
   uses a tc= (``table continuation'') entry to pick up the rest of the
   ``standard'' settings for a particular data rate.

   If you have a 28.8 Kbps modem and/or you want to take advantage of
   compression on a 14.4 Kbps modem, you need to use a higher communications
   rate than 19.2 Kbps. Here is an example of a gettytab entry starting a
   57.6 Kbps:

 #
 # Additions for a V.32bis or V.34 Modem
 # Starting at 57.6 Kbps
 #
 vm|VH300|Very High Speed Modem at 300,8-bit:\
         :nx=VH57600:tc=std.300:
 vn|VH1200|Very High Speed Modem at 1200,8-bit:\
         :nx=VH300:tc=std.1200:
 vo|VH2400|Very High Speed Modem at 2400,8-bit:\
         :nx=VH1200:tc=std.2400:
 vp|VH9600|Very High Speed Modem at 9600,8-bit:\
         :nx=VH2400:tc=std.9600:
 vq|VH57600|Very High Speed Modem at 57600,8-bit:\
         :nx=VH9600:tc=std.57600:

   If you have a slow CPU or a heavily loaded system and do not have
   16550A-based serial ports, you may receive ``sio'' ``silo'' errors at
   57.6 Kbps.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.4.2 /etc/ttys

   Configuration of the /etc/ttys file was covered in Example 17-1.
   Configuration for modems is similar but we must pass a different argument
   to getty and specify a different terminal type. The general format for
   both locked-speed and matching-speed configurations is:

 ttyd0   "/usr/libexec/getty xxx"   dialup on

   The first item in the above line is the device special file for this entry
   -- ttyd0 means /dev/ttyd0 is the file that this getty will be watching.
   The second item, "/usr/libexec/getty xxx" (xxx will be replaced by the
   initial gettytab capability) is the process init will run on the device.
   The third item, dialup, is the default terminal type. The fourth
   parameter, on, indicates to init that the line is operational. There can
   be a fifth parameter, secure, but it should only be used for terminals
   which are physically secure (such as the system console).

   The default terminal type (dialup in the example above) may depend on
   local preferences. dialup is the traditional default terminal type on
   dial-up lines so that users may customize their login scripts to notice
   when the terminal is dialup and automatically adjust their terminal type.
   However, the author finds it easier at his site to specify vt102 as the
   default terminal type, since the users just use VT102 emulation on their
   remote systems.

   After you have made changes to /etc/ttys, you may send the init process a
   HUP signal to re-read the file. You can use the command

 # kill -HUP 1

   to send the signal. If this is your first time setting up the system, you
   may want to wait until your modem(s) are properly configured and connected
   before signaling init.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.4.4.2.1 Locked-speed Config

   For a locked-speed configuration, your ttys entry needs to have a
   fixed-speed entry provided to getty. For a modem whose port speed is
   locked at 19.2 Kbps, the ttys entry might look like this:

 ttyd0   "/usr/libexec/getty std.19200"   dialup on

   If your modem is locked at a different data rate, substitute the
   appropriate value for std.speed instead of std.19200. Make sure that you
   use a valid type listed in /etc/gettytab.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      17.4.4.2.2 Matching-speed Config

   In a matching-speed configuration, your ttys entry needs to reference the
   appropriate beginning ``auto-baud'' (sic) entry in /etc/gettytab. For
   example, if you added the above suggested entry for a matching-speed modem
   that starts at 19.2 Kbps (the gettytab entry containing the V19200
   starting point), your ttys entry might look like this:

 ttyd0   "/usr/libexec/getty V19200"   dialup on

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.4.3 /etc/rc.serial

   High-speed modems, like V.32, V.32bis, and V.34 modems, need to use
   hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. You can add stty commands to
   /etc/rc.serial to set the hardware flow control flag in the DragonFly
   kernel for the modem ports.

   For example to set the termios flag crtscts on serial port #1's (COM2)
   dial-in and dial-out initialization devices, the following lines could be
   added to /etc/rc.serial:

 # Serial port initial configuration
 stty -f /dev/ttyid1 crtscts
 stty -f /dev/cuaia1 crtscts

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.5 Modem Settings

   If you have a modem whose parameters may be permanently set in
   non-volatile RAM, you will need to use a terminal program (such as Telix
   under MS-DOS or tip under DragonFly) to set the parameters. Connect to the
   modem using the same communications speed as the initial speed getty will
   use and configure the modem's non-volatile RAM to match these
   requirements:

     * CD asserted when connected

     * DTR asserted for operation; dropping DTR hangs up line and resets
       modem

     * CTS transmitted data flow control

     * Disable XON/XOFF flow control

     * RTS received data flow control

     * Quiet mode (no result codes)

     * No command echo

   Please read the documentation for your modem to find out what commands
   and/or DIP switch settings you need to give it.

   For example, to set the above parameters on a U.S. Robotics(R)
   Sportster(R) 14,400 external modem, one could give these commands to the
   modem:

 ATZ
 AT&C1&D2&H1&I0&R2&W

   You might also want to take this opportunity to adjust other settings in
   the modem, such as whether it will use V.42bis and/or MNP5 compression.

   The U.S. Robotics Sportster 14,400 external modem also has some DIP
   switches that need to be set; for other modems, perhaps you can use these
   settings as an example:

     * Switch 1: UP -- DTR Normal

     * Switch 2: N/A (Verbal Result Codes/Numeric Result Codes)

     * Switch 3: UP -- Suppress Result Codes

     * Switch 4: DOWN -- No echo, offline commands

     * Switch 5: UP -- Auto Answer

     * Switch 6: UP -- Carrier Detect Normal

     * Switch 7: UP -- Load NVRAM Defaults

     * Switch 8: N/A (Smart Mode/Dumb Mode)

   Result codes should be disabled/suppressed for dial-up modems to avoid
   problems that can occur if getty mistakenly gives a login: prompt to a
   modem that is in command mode and the modem echoes the command or returns
   a result code. This sequence can result in a extended, silly conversation
   between getty and the modem.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.5.1 Locked-speed Config

   For a locked-speed configuration, you will need to configure the modem to
   maintain a constant modem-to-computer data rate independent of the
   communications rate. On a U.S. Robotics Sportster 14,400 external modem,
   these commands will lock the modem-to-computer data rate at the speed used
   to issue the commands:

 ATZ
 AT&B1&W

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.5.2 Matching-speed Config

   For a variable-speed configuration, you will need to configure your modem
   to adjust its serial port data rate to match the incoming call rate. On a
   U.S. Robotics Sportster 14,400 external modem, these commands will lock
   the modem's error-corrected data rate to the speed used to issue the
   commands, but allow the serial port rate to vary for non-error-corrected
   connections:

 ATZ
 AT&B2&W

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.5.3 Checking the Modem's Configuration

   Most high-speed modems provide commands to view the modem's current
   operating parameters in a somewhat human-readable fashion. On the U.S.
   Robotics Sportster 14,400 external modems, the command ATI5 displays the
   settings that are stored in the non-volatile RAM. To see the true
   operating parameters of the modem (as influenced by the modem's DIP switch
   settings), use the commands ATZ and then ATI4.

   If you have a different brand of modem, check your modem's manual to see
   how to double-check your modem's configuration parameters.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.4.6 Troubleshooting

   Here are a few steps you can follow to check out the dial-up modem on your
   system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.6.1 Checking Out the DragonFly System

   Hook up your modem to your DragonFly system, boot the system, and, if your
   modem has status indication lights, watch to see whether the modem's DTR
   indicator lights when the login: prompt appears on the system's console --
   if it lights up, that should mean that DragonFly has started a getty
   process on the appropriate communications port and is waiting for the
   modem to accept a call.

   If the DTR indicator does not light, login to the DragonFly system through
   the console and issue a ps ax to see if DragonFly is trying to run a getty
   process on the correct port. You should see lines like these among the
   processes displayed:

   114 ??  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0
   115 ??  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd1

   If you see something different, like this:

   114 d0  I      0:00.10 /usr/libexec/getty V19200 ttyd0

   and the modem has not accepted a call yet, this means that getty has
   completed its open on the communications port. This could indicate a
   problem with the cabling or a mis-configured modem, because getty should
   not be able to open the communications port until CD (carrier detect) has
   been asserted by the modem.

   If you do not see any getty processes waiting to open the desired ttydN
   port, double-check your entries in /etc/ttys to see if there are any
   mistakes there. Also, check the log file /var/log/messages to see if there
   are any log messages from init or getty regarding any problems. If there
   are any messages, triple-check the configuration files /etc/ttys and
   /etc/gettytab, as well as the appropriate device special files /dev/ttydN,
   for any mistakes, missing entries, or missing device special files.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.4.6.2 Try Dialing In

   Try dialing into the system; be sure to use 8 bits, no parity, and 1 stop
   bit on the remote system. If you do not get a prompt right away, or get
   garbage, try pressing Enter about once per second. If you still do not see
   a login: prompt after a while, try sending a BREAK. If you are using a
   high-speed modem to do the dialing, try dialing again after locking the
   dialing modem's interface speed (via AT&B1 on a U.S. Robotics Sportster
   modem, for example).

   If you still cannot get a login: prompt, check /etc/gettytab again and
   double-check that

     * The initial capability name specified in /etc/ttys for the line
       matches a name of a capability in /etc/gettytab

     * Each nx= entry matches another gettytab capability name

     * Each tc= entry matches another gettytab capability name

   If you dial but the modem on the DragonFly system will not answer, make
   sure that the modem is configured to answer the phone when DTR is
   asserted. If the modem seems to be configured correctly, verify that the
   DTR line is asserted by checking the modem's indicator lights (if it has
   any).

   If you have gone over everything several times and it still does not work,
   take a break and come back to it later. If it still does not work, perhaps
   you can send an electronic mail message to the DragonFly User related
   mailing list describing your modem and your problem, and the good folks on
   the list will try to help.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

17.5 Dial-out Service

   The following are tips for getting your host to be able to connect over
   the modem to another computer. This is appropriate for establishing a
   terminal session with a remote host.

   This is useful to log onto a BBS.

   This kind of connection can be extremely helpful to get a file on the
   Internet if you have problems with PPP. If you need to FTP something and
   PPP is broken, use the terminal session to FTP it. Then use zmodem to
   transfer it to your machine.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.1 My Stock Hayes Modem Is Not Supported, What Can I Do?

   Actually, the manual page for tip is out of date. There is a generic Hayes
   dialer already built in. Just use at=hayes in your /etc/remote file.

   The Hayes driver is not smart enough to recognize some of the advanced
   features of newer modems--messages like BUSY, NO DIALTONE, or CONNECT
   115200 will just confuse it. You should turn those messages off when you
   use tip (using ATX0&W).

   Also, the dial timeout for tip is 60 seconds. Your modem should use
   something less, or else tip will think there is a communication problem.
   Try ATS7=45&W.

     Note: As shipped, tip does not yet support Hayes modems fully. The
     solution is to edit the file tipconf.h in the directory
     /usr/src/usr.bin/tip/tip. Obviously you need the source distribution to
     do this.

     Edit the line #define HAYES 0 to #define HAYES 1. Then make and make
     install. Everything works nicely after that.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.2 How Am I Expected to Enter These AT Commands?

   Make what is called a ``direct'' entry in your /etc/remote file. For
   example, if your modem is hooked up to the first serial port, /dev/cuaa0,
   then put in the following line:

 cuaa0:dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#19200:pa=none

   Use the highest bps rate your modem supports in the br capability. Then,
   type tip cuaa0 and you will be connected to your modem.

   If there is no /dev/cuaa0 on your system, do this:

 # cd /dev
 # sh MAKEDEV cuaa0

   Or use cu as root with the following command:

 # cu -lline -sspeed

   line is the serial port (e.g./dev/cuaa0) and speed is the speed
   (e.g.57600). When you are done entering the AT commands hit ~. to exit.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.3 The @ Sign for the pn Capability Does Not Work!

   The @ sign in the phone number capability tells tip to look in /etc/phones
   for a phone number. But the @ sign is also a special character in
   capability files like /etc/remote. Escape it with a backslash:

 pn=\@

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.4 How Can I Dial a Phone Number on the Command Line?

   Put what is called a ``generic'' entry in your /etc/remote file. For
   example:

 tip115200|Dial any phone number at 115200 bps:\
         :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#115200:at=hayes:pa=none:du:
 tip57600|Dial any phone number at 57600 bps:\
         :dv=/dev/cuaa0:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:

   Then you can do things like:

 # tip -115200 5551234

   If you prefer cu over tip, use a generic cu entry:

 cu115200|Use cu to dial any number at 115200bps:\
         :dv=/dev/cuaa1:br#57600:at=hayes:pa=none:du:

   and type:

 # cu 5551234 -s 115200

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.5 Do I Have to Type in the bps Rate Every Time I Do That?

   Put in an entry for tip1200 or cu1200, but go ahead and use whatever bps
   rate is appropriate with the br capability. tip thinks a good default is
   1200 bps which is why it looks for a tip1200 entry. You do not have to use
   1200 bps, though.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.6 I Access a Number of Hosts Through a Terminal Server

   Rather than waiting until you are connected and typing CONNECT <host> each
   time, use tip's cm capability. For example, these entries in /etc/remote:

 pain|pain.deep13.com|Forrester's machine:\
         :cm=CONNECT pain\n:tc=deep13:
 muffin|muffin.deep13.com|Frank's machine:\
         :cm=CONNECT muffin\n:tc=deep13:
 deep13:Gizmonics Institute terminal server:\
         :dv=/dev/cuaa2:br#38400:at=hayes:du:pa=none:pn=5551234:

   will let you type tip pain or tip muffin to connect to the hosts pain or
   muffin, and tip deep13 to get to the terminal server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.7 Can Tip Try More Than One Line for Each Site?

   This is often a problem where a university has several modem lines and
   several thousand students trying to use them.

   Make an entry for your university in /etc/remote and use @ for the pn
   capability:

 big-university:\
         :pn=\@:tc=dialout
 dialout:\
         :dv=/dev/cuaa3:br#9600:at=courier:du:pa=none:

   Then, list the phone numbers for the university in /etc/phones:

 big-university 5551111
 big-university 5551112
 big-university 5551113
 big-university 5551114

   tip will try each one in the listed order, then give up. If you want to
   keep retrying, run tip in a while loop.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.8 Why Do I Have to Hit Ctrl+P Twice to Send Ctrl+P Once?

   Ctrl+P is the default ``force'' character, used to tell tip that the next
   character is literal data. You can set the force character to any other
   character with the ~s escape, which means ``set a variable.''

   Type ~sforce=single-char followed by a newline. single-char is any single
   character. If you leave out single-char, then the force character is the
   nul character, which you can get by typing Ctrl+2 or Ctrl+Space. A pretty
   good value for single-char is Shift+Ctrl+6, which is only used on some
   terminal servers.

   You can have the force character be whatever you want by specifying the
   following in your $HOME/.tiprc file:

 force=<single-char>

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.9 Suddenly Everything I Type Is in Upper Case??

   You must have pressed Ctrl+A, tip's ``raise character,'' specially
   designed for people with broken caps-lock keys. Use ~s as above and set
   the variable raisechar to something reasonable. In fact, you can set it to
   the same as the force character, if you never expect to use either of
   these features.

   Here is a sample .tiprc file perfect for Emacs users who need to type
   Ctrl+2 and Ctrl+A a lot:

 force=^^
 raisechar=^^

   The ^^ is Shift+Ctrl+6.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.10 How Can I Do File Transfers with tip?

   If you are talking to another UNIX system, you can send and receive files
   with ~p (put) and ~t (take). These commands run cat and echo on the remote
   system to accept and send files. The syntax is:

   ~p local-file [remote-file]

   ~t remote-file [local-file]

   There is no error checking, so you probably should use another protocol,
   like zmodem.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.5.11 How Can I Run zmodem with tip?

   To receive files, start the sending program on the remote end. Then, type
   ~C rz to begin receiving them locally.

   To send files, start the receiving program on the remote end. Then, type
   ~C sz files to send them to the remote system.

17.6 Setting Up the Serial Console

   Contributed by Kazutaka YOKOTA. Based on a document by Bill Paul.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.6.1 Introduction

   DragonFly has the ability to boot on a system with only a dumb terminal on
   a serial port as a console. Such a configuration should be useful for two
   classes of people: system administrators who wish to install DragonFly on
   machines that have no keyboard or monitor attached, and developers who
   want to debug the kernel or device drivers.

   As described in Chapter 7, DragonFly employs a three stage bootstrap. The
   first two stages are in the boot block code which is stored at the
   beginning of the DragonFly slice on the boot disk. The boot block will
   then load and run the boot loader (/boot/loader) as the third stage code.

   In order to set up the serial console you must configure the boot block
   code, the boot loader code and the kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.6.2 Serial Console Configuration, Terse Version

   This section assumes that you are using the default setup, know how to
   connect serial ports and just want a fast overview of a serial console. If
   you encounter difficulty with these steps, please see the more extensive
   explaination of all the options and advanced settings in Section 17.6.3.

    1. Connect the serial port. The serial console will be on COM1.

    2. echo -h > /boot.config to enable the serial console for the boot
       loader and kernel.

    3. Edit /etc/ttys and change off to on for the ttyd0 entry. This enables
       a login prompt on the serial console, which mirrors how video consoles
       are typically setup.

    4. shutdown -r now will reboot the system with the serial console.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.6.3 Serial Console Configuration

    1. Prepare a serial cable.

       You will need either a null-modem cable or a standard serial cable and
       a null-modem adapter. See Section 17.2.2 for a discussion on serial
       cables.

    2. Unplug your keyboard.

       Most PC systems probe for the keyboard during the Power-On Self-Test
       (POST) and will generate an error if the keyboard is not detected.
       Some machines complain loudly about the lack of a keyboard and will
       not continue to boot until it is plugged in.

       If your computer complains about the error, but boots anyway, then you
       do not have to do anything special. (Some machines with Phoenix BIOS
       installed merely say ``Keyboard failed'' and continue to boot
       normally.)

       If your computer refuses to boot without a keyboard attached then you
       will have to configure the BIOS so that it ignores this error (if it
       can). Consult your motherboard's manual for details on how to do this.

         Tip: Setting the keyboard to ``Not installed'' in the BIOS setup
         does not mean that you will not be able to use your keyboard. All
         this does is tell the BIOS not to probe for a keyboard at power-on,
         so it will not complain if the keyboard is not plugged in. You can
         leave the keyboard plugged in even with this flag set to ``Not
         installed'' and the keyboard will still work.

         Note: If your system has a PS/2(R) mouse, chances are very good that
         you may have to unplug your mouse as well as your keyboard. This is
         because PS/2 mice share some hardware with the keyboard and leaving
         the mouse plugged in can fool the keyboard probe into thinking the
         keyboard is still there. In general, this is not a problem since the
         mouse is not much good without the keyboard anyway.

    3. Plug a dumb terminal into COM1 (sio0).

       If you do not have a dumb terminal, you can use an old PC/XT with a
       modem program, or the serial port on another UNIX box. If you do not
       have a COM1 (sio0), get one. At this time, there is no way to select a
       port other than COM1 for the boot blocks without recompiling the boot
       blocks. If you are already using COM1 for another device, you will
       have to temporarily remove that device and install a new boot block
       and kernel once you get DragonFly up and running. (It is assumed that
       COM1 will be available on a file/compute/terminal server anyway; if
       you really need COM1 for something else (and you cannot switch that
       something else to COM2 (sio1)), then you probably should not even be
       bothering with all this in the first place.)

    4. Make sure the configuration file of your kernel has appropriate flags
       set for COM1 (sio0).

       Relevant flags are:

            0x10

                    Enables console support for this unit. The other console
                    flags are ignored unless this is set. Currently, at most
                    one unit can have console support; the first one (in
                    config file order) with this flag set is preferred. This
                    option alone will not make the serial port the console.
                    Set the following flag or use the -h option described
                    below, together with this flag.

            0x20

                    Forces this unit to be the console (unless there is
                    another higher priority console), regardless of the -h
                    option discussed below. This flag replaces the COMCONSOLE
                    option in DragonFly versions 2.X. The flag 0x20 must be
                    used together with the 0x10 flag.

            0x40

                    Reserves this unit (in conjunction with 0x10) and makes
                    the unit unavailable for normal access. You should not
                    set this flag to the serial port unit which you want to
                    use as the serial console. This reserves this port for
                    "low-level IO", i.e. kernel debugging.

            0x80

                    This port will be used for remote kernel debugging.

       Example:

 device sio0 at isa? port IO_COM1 flags 0x10 irq 4

       See the sio(4) manual page for more details.

       If the flags were not set, you need to run UserConfig (on a different
       console) or recompile the kernel.

    5. Create boot.config in the root directory of the a partition on the
       boot drive.

       This file will instruct the boot block code how you would like to boot
       the system. In order to activate the serial console, you need one or
       more of the following options--if you want multiple options, include
       them all on the same line:

            -h

                    Toggles internal and serial consoles. You can use this to
                    switch console devices. For instance, if you boot from
                    the internal (video) console, you can use -h to direct
                    the boot loader and the kernel to use the serial port as
                    its console device. Alternatively, if you boot from the
                    serial port, you can use the -h to tell the boot loader
                    and the kernel to use the video display as the console
                    instead.

            -D

                    Toggles single and dual console configurations. In the
                    single configuration the console will be either the
                    internal console (video display) or the serial port,
                    depending on the state of the -h option above. In the
                    dual console configuration, both the video display and
                    the serial port will become the console at the same time,
                    regardless of the state of the -h option. However, note
                    that the dual console configuration takes effect only
                    during the boot block is running. Once the boot loader
                    gets control, the console specified by the -h option
                    becomes the only console.

            -P

                    Makes the boot block probe the keyboard. If no keyboard
                    is found, the -D and -h options are automatically set.

                      Note: Due to space constraints in the current version
                      of the boot blocks, the -P option is capable of
                      detecting extended keyboards only. Keyboards with less
                      than 101 keys (and without F11 and F12 keys) may not be
                      detected. Keyboards on some laptop computers may not be
                      properly found because of this limitation. If this is
                      the case with your system, you have to abandon using
                      the -P option. Unfortunately there is no workaround for
                      this problem.

       Use either the -P option to select the console automatically, or the
       -h option to activate the serial console.

       You may include other options described in boot(8) as well.

       The options, except for -P, will be passed to the boot loader
       (/boot/loader). The boot loader will determine which of the internal
       video or the serial port should become the console by examining the
       state of the -h option alone. This means that if you specify the -D
       option but not the -h option in /boot.config, you can use the serial
       port as the console only during the boot block; the boot loader will
       use the internal video display as the console.

    6. Boot the machine.

       When you start your DragonFly box, the boot blocks will echo the
       contents of /boot.config to the console. For example:

 /boot.config: -P
 Keyboard: no

       The second line appears only if you put -P in /boot.config and
       indicates presence/absence of the keyboard. These messages go to
       either serial or internal console, or both, depending on the option in
       /boot.config.

             Options              Message goes to        
       none                 internal console             
       -h                   serial console               
       -D                   serial and internal consoles 
       -Dh                  serial and internal consoles 
       -P, keyboard present internal console             
       -P, keyboard absent  serial console               

       After the above messages, there will be a small pause before the boot
       blocks continue loading the boot loader and before any further
       messages printed to the console. Under normal circumstances, you do
       not need to interrupt the boot blocks, but you may want to do so in
       order to make sure things are set up correctly.

       Hit any key, other than Enter, at the console to interrupt the boot
       process. The boot blocks will then prompt you for further action. You
       should now see something like:

 >> DragonFly/i386 BOOT
 Default: 0:ad(0,a)/boot/loader
 boot:

       Verify the above message appears on either the serial or internal
       console or both, according to the options you put in /boot.config. If
       the message appears in the correct console, hit Enter to continue the
       boot process.

       If you want the serial console but you do not see the prompt on the
       serial terminal, something is wrong with your settings. In the
       meantime, you enter -h and hit Enter/Return (if possible) to tell the
       boot block (and then the boot loader and the kernel) to choose the
       serial port for the console. Once the system is up, go back and check
       what went wrong.

   After the boot loader is loaded and you are in the third stage of the boot
   process you can still switch between the internal console and the serial
   console by setting appropriate environment variables in the boot loader.
   See Section 17.6.6.

  17.6.5 Tips for the Serial Console

    17.6.5.1 Setting a Faster Serial Port Speed

   By default, the serial port settings are: 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity,
   and 1 stop bit. If you wish to change the speed, you need to recompile at
   least the boot blocks. Add the following line to /etc/make.conf and
   compile new boot blocks:

 BOOT_COMCONSOLE_SPEED=19200

   If the serial console is configured in some other way than by booting with
   -h, or if the serial console used by the kernel is different from the one
   used by the boot blocks, then you must also add the following option to
   the kernel configuration file and compile a new kernel:

 options CONSPEED=19200

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.6.5.2 Using Serial Port Other Than sio0 for the Console

   Using a port other than sio0 as the console requires some recompiling. If
   you want to use another serial port for whatever reasons, recompile the
   boot blocks, the boot loader and the kernel as follows.

    1. Get the kernel source. (See Section 21.1)

    2. Edit /etc/make.conf and set BOOT_COMCONSOLE_PORT to the address of the
       port you want to use (0x3F8, 0x2F8, 0x3E8 or 0x2E8). Only sio0 through
       sio3 (COM1 through COM4) can be used; multiport serial cards will not
       work. No interrupt setting is needed.

    3. Create a custom kernel configuration file and add appropriate flags
       for the serial port you want to use. For example, if you want to make
       sio1 (COM2) the console:

 device sio1 at isa? port IO_COM2 flags 0x10 irq 3

       or

 device sio1 at isa? port IO_COM2 flags 0x30 irq 3

       The console flags for the other serial ports should not be set.

    4. Recompile and install the boot blocks and the boot loader:

 # cd /sys/boot
 # make
 # make install

    5. Rebuild and install the kernel.

    6. Write the boot blocks to the boot disk with disklabel(8) and boot from
       the new kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.6.5.3 Entering the DDB Debugger from the Serial Line

   If you wish to drop into the kernel debugger from the serial console
   (useful for remote diagnostics, but also dangerous if you generate a
   spurious BREAK on the serial port!) then you should compile your kernel
   with the following options:

 options BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER
 options DDB

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.6.5.4 Getting a Login Prompt on the Serial Console

   While this is not required, you may wish to get a login prompt over the
   serial line, now that you can see boot messages and can enter the kernel
   debugging session through the serial console. Here is how to do it.

   Open the file /etc/ttys with an editor and locate the lines:

 ttyd0 "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600" unknown off secure
 ttyd1 "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600" unknown off secure
 ttyd2 "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600" unknown off secure
 ttyd3 "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600" unknown off secure

   ttyd0 through ttyd3 corresponds to COM1 through COM4. Change off to on for
   the desired port. If you have changed the speed of the serial port, you
   need to change std.9600 to match the current setting, e.g. std.19200.

   You may also want to change the terminal type from unknown to the actual
   type of your serial terminal.

   After editing the file, you must kill -HUP 1 to make this change take
   effect.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.6.6 Changing Console from the Boot Loader

   Previous sections described how to set up the serial console by tweaking
   the boot block. This section shows that you can specify the console by
   entering some commands and environment variables in the boot loader. As
   the boot loader is invoked at the third stage of the boot process, after
   the boot block, the settings in the boot loader will override the settings
   in the boot block.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.6.6.1 Setting Up the Serial Console

   You can easily specify the boot loader and the kernel to use the serial
   console by writing just one line in /boot/loader.rc:

 set console=comconsole

   This will take effect regardless of the settings in the boot block
   discussed in the previous section.

   You had better put the above line as the first line of /boot/loader.rc so
   as to see boot messages on the serial console as early as possible.

   Likewise, you can specify the internal console as:

 set console=vidconsole

   If you do not set the boot loader environment variable console, the boot
   loader, and subsequently the kernel, will use whichever console indicated
   by the -h option in the boot block.

   In versions 3.2 or later, you may specify the console in
   /boot/loader.conf.local or /boot/loader.conf, rather than in
   /boot/loader.rc. In this method your /boot/loader.rc should look like:

 include /boot/loader.4th
 start

   Then, create /boot/loader.conf.local and put the following line there.

 console=comconsole

   or

 console=vidconsole

   See loader.conf(5) for more information.

     Note: At the moment, the boot loader has no option equivalent to the -P
     option in the boot block, and there is no provision to automatically
     select the internal console and the serial console based on the presence
     of the keyboard.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    17.6.6.2 Using a Serial Port Other Than sio0 for the Console

   You need to recompile the boot loader to use a serial port other than sio0
   for the serial console. Follow the procedure described in Section
   17.6.5.2.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  17.6.7 Caveats

   The idea here is to allow people to set up dedicated servers that require
   no graphics hardware or attached keyboards. Unfortunately, while most
   systems will let you boot without a keyboard, there are quite a few that
   will not let you boot without a graphics adapter. Machines with AMI BIOSes
   can be configured to boot with no graphics adapter installed simply by
   changing the ``graphics adapter'' setting in the CMOS configuration to
   ``Not installed.''

   However, many machines do not support this option and will refuse to boot
   if you have no display hardware in the system. With these machines, you
   will have to leave some kind of graphics card plugged in, (even if it is
   just a junky mono board) although you will not have to attach a monitor.
   You might also try installing an AMI BIOS.

                            Chapter 18 PPP and SLIP

   Restructured, reorganized, and updated by Jim Mock.

18.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly has a number of ways to link one computer to another. To
   establish a network or Internet connection through a dial-up modem, or to
   allow others to do so through you, requires the use of PPP or SLIP. This
   chapter describes setting up these modem-based communication services in
   detail.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to set up user PPP.

     * How to set up kernel PPP.

     * How to set up PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet).

     * How to set up PPPoA (PPP over ATM).

     * How to configure and set up a SLIP client and server.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Be familiar with basic network terminology.

     * Understand the basics and purpose of a dialup connection and PPP
       and/or SLIP.

   You may be wondering what the main difference is between user PPP and
   kernel PPP. The answer is simple: user PPP processes the inbound and
   outbound data in userland rather than in the kernel. This is expensive in
   terms of copying the data between the kernel and userland, but allows a
   far more feature-rich PPP implementation. User PPP uses the tun device to
   communicate with the outside world whereas kernel PPP uses the ppp device.

     Note: Throughout in this chapter, user PPP will simply be referred to as
     ppp unless a distinction needs to be made between it and any other PPP
     software such as pppd. Unless otherwise stated, all of the commands
     explained in this chapter should be executed as root.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

18.2 Using User PPP

   Updated and enhanced by Tom Rhodes. Originally contributed by Brian
   Somers. With input from Nik Clayton, Dirk Fro:mberg, and Peter Childs.

  18.2.1 User PPP

    18.2.1.1 Assumptions

   This document assumes you have the following:

     * An account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which you connect
       to using PPP.

     * You have a modem or other device connected to your system and
       configured correctly which allows you to connect to your ISP.

     * The dial-up number(s) of your ISP.

     * Your login name and password. (Either a regular UNIX style login and
       password pair, or a PAP or CHAP login and password pair.)

     * The IP address of one or more name servers. Normally, you will be
       given two IP addresses by your ISP to use for this. If they have not
       given you at least one, then you can use the enable dns command in
       ppp.conf and ppp will set the name servers for you. This feature
       depends on your ISPs PPP implementation supporting DNS negotiation.

   The following information may be supplied by your ISP, but is not
   completely necessary:

     * The IP address of your ISP's gateway. The gateway is the machine to
       which you will connect and will be set up as your default route. If
       you do not have this information, we can make one up and your ISP's
       PPP server will tell us the correct value when we connect.

       This IP number is referred to as HISADDR by ppp.

     * The netmask you should use. If your ISP has not provided you with one,
       you can safely use 255.255.255.255.

     * If your ISP provides you with a static IP address and hostname, you
       can enter it. Otherwise, we simply let the peer assign whatever IP
       address it sees fit.

   If you do not have any of the required information, contact your ISP.

     Note: Throughout this section, many of the examples showing the contents
     of configuration files are numbered by line. These numbers serve to aid
     in the presentation and discussion only and are not meant to be placed
     in the actual file. Proper indentation with tab and space characters is
     also important.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.2.1.2 Creating PPP Device Nodes

   Under normal circumstances, most users will only need one tun device
   (/dev/tun0). References to tun0 below may be changed to tunN where N is
   any unit number corresponding to your system.

   The easiest way to make sure that the tun0 device is configured correctly
   is to remake the device. To remake the device, do the following:

 # cd /dev
           # sh MAKEDEV tun0

   If you need 16 tunnel devices in your kernel, you will need to create
   them. This can be done by executing the following commands:

 # cd /dev
           # sh MAKEDEV tun15

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.2.1.3 Automatic PPP Configuration

   Both ppp and pppd (the kernel level implementation of PPP) use the
   configuration files located in the /etc/ppp directory. Examples for user
   ppp can be found in /usr/share/examples/ppp/.

   Configuring ppp requires that you edit a number of files, depending on
   your requirements. What you put in them depends to some extent on whether
   your ISP allocates IP addresses statically (i.e., you get given one IP
   address, and always use that one) or dynamically (i.e., your IP address
   changes each time you connect to your ISP).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.1 PPP and Static IP Addresses

   You will need to edit the /etc/ppp/ppp.conf configuration file. It should
   look similar to the example below.

     Note: Lines that end in a : start in the first column (beginning of the
     line)-- all other lines should be indented as shown using spaces or
     tabs.

 1     default:
 2       set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command
 3       ident user-ppp VERSION (built COMPILATIONDATE)
 4       set device /dev/cuaa0
 5       set speed 115200
 6       set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \
 7                 \"\" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0 OK \\dATDT\\T TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"
 8       set timeout 180
 9       enable dns
 10
 11    provider:
 12      set phone "(123) 456 7890"
 13      set authname foo
 14      set authkey bar
 15      set login "TIMEOUT 10 \"\" \"\" gin:--gin: \\U word: \\P col: ppp"
 16      set timeout 300
 17      set ifaddr x.x.x.x y.y.y.y 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0
 18      add default HISADDR

   Line 1:

           Identifies the default entry. Commands in this entry are executed
           automatically when ppp is run.

   Line 2:

           Enables logging parameters. When the configuration is working
           satisfactorily, this line should be reduced to saying

 set log phase tun

           in order to avoid excessive log file sizes.

   Line 3:

           Tells PPP how to identify itself to the peer. PPP identifies
           itself to the peer if it has any trouble negotiating and setting
           up the link, providing information that the peers administrator
           may find useful when investigating such problems.

   Line 4:

           Identifies the device to which the modem is connected. COM1 is
           /dev/cuaa0 and COM2 is /dev/cuaa1.

   Line 5:

           Sets the speed you want to connect at. If 115200 does not work (it
           should with any reasonably new modem), try 38400 instead.

   Line 6 & 7:

           The dial string. User PPP uses an expect-send syntax similar to
           the chat(8) program. Refer to the manual page for information on
           the features of this language.

           Note that this command continues onto the next line for
           readability. Any command in ppp.conf may do this if the last
           character on the line is a ``\'' character.

   Line 8:

           Sets the idle timeout for the link. 180 seconds is the default, so
           this line is purely cosmetic.

   Line 9:

           Tells PPP to ask the peer to confirm the local resolver settings.
           If you run a local name server, this line should be commented out
           or removed.

   Line 10:

           A blank line for readability. Blank lines are ignored by PPP.

   Line 11:

           Identifies an entry for a provider called ``provider''. This could
           be changed to the name of your ISP so that later you can use the
           load ISP to start the connection.

   Line 12:

           Sets the phone number for this provider. Multiple phone numbers
           may be specified using the colon (:) or pipe character (|)as a
           separator. The difference between the two separators is described
           in ppp(8). To summarize, if you want to rotate through the
           numbers, use a colon. If you want to always attempt to dial the
           first number first and only use the other numbers if the first
           number fails, use the pipe character. Always quote the entire set
           of phone numbers as shown.

           You must enclose the phone number in quotation marks (") if there
           is any intention on using spaces in the phone number. This can
           cause a simple, yet subtle error.

   Line 13 & 14:

           Identifies the user name and password. When connecting using a
           UNIX style login prompt, these values are referred to by the set
           login command using the \U and \P variables. When connecting using
           PAP or CHAP, these values are used at authentication time.

   Line 15:

           If you are using PAP or CHAP, there will be no login at this
           point, and this line should be commented out or removed. See PAP
           and CHAP authentication for further details.

           The login string is of the same chat-like syntax as the dial
           string. In this example, the string works for a service whose
           login session looks like this:

 J. Random Provider
 login: foo
 password: bar
 protocol: ppp

           You will need to alter this script to suit your own needs. When
           you write this script for the first time, you should ensure that
           you have enabled ``chat'' logging so you can determine if the
           conversation is going as expected.

   Line 16:

           Sets the default idle timeout (in seconds) for the connection.
           Here, the connection will be closed automatically after 300
           seconds of inactivity. If you never want to timeout, set this
           value to zero or use the -ddial command line switch.

   Line 17:

           Sets the interface addresses. The string x.x.x.x should be
           replaced by the IP address that your provider has allocated to
           you. The string y.y.y.y should be replaced by the IP address that
           your ISP indicated for their gateway (the machine to which you
           connect). If your ISP has not given you a gateway address, use
           10.0.0.2/0. If you need to use a ``guessed'' address, make sure
           that you create an entry in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup as per the
           instructions for PPP and Dynamic IP addresses. If this line is
           omitted, ppp cannot run in -auto mode.

   Line 18:

           Adds a default route to your ISP's gateway. The special word
           HISADDR is replaced with the gateway address specified on line 17.
           It is important that this line appears after line 17, otherwise
           HISADDR will not yet be initialized.

           If you do not wish to run ppp in -auto, this line should be moved
           to the ppp.linkup file.

   It is not necessary to add an entry to ppp.linkup when you have a static
   IP address and are running ppp in -auto mode as your routing table entries
   are already correct before you connect. You may however wish to create an
   entry to invoke programs after connection. This is explained later with
   the sendmail example.

   Example configuration files can be found in the /usr/share/examples/ppp/
   directory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.2 PPP and Dynamic IP Addresses

   If your service provider does not assign static IP addresses, ppp can be
   configured to negotiate the local and remote addresses. This is done by
   ``guessing'' an IP address and allowing ppp to set it up correctly using
   the IP Configuration Protocol (IPCP) after connecting. The ppp.conf
   configuration is the same as PPP and Static IP Addresses, with the
   following change:

 17      set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.255

   Again, do not include the line number, it is just for reference.
   Indentation of at least one space is required.

   Line 17:

           The number after the / character is the number of bits of the
           address that ppp will insist on. You may wish to use IP numbers
           more appropriate to your circumstances, but the above example will
           always work.

           The last argument (0.0.0.0) tells PPP to start negotiations using
           address 0.0.0.0 rather than 10.0.0.1 and is necessary for some
           ISPs. Do not use 0.0.0.0 as the first argument to set ifaddr as it
           prevents PPP from setting up an initial route in -auto mode.

   If you are not running in -auto mode, you will need to create an entry in
   /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup. ppp.linkup is used after a connection has been
   established. At this point, ppp will have assigned the interface addresses
   and it will now be possible to add the routing table entries:

 1     provider:
 2      add default HISADDR

   Line 1:

           On establishing a connection, ppp will look for an entry in
           ppp.linkup according to the following rules: First, try to match
           the same label as we used in ppp.conf. If that fails, look for an
           entry for the IP address of our gateway. This entry is a
           four-octet IP style label. If we still have not found an entry,
           look for the MYADDR entry.

   Line 2:

           This line tells ppp to add a default route that points to HISADDR.
           HISADDR will be replaced with the IP number of the gateway as
           negotiated by the IPCP.

   See the pmdemand entry in the files
   /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample and
   /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.linkup.sample for a detailed example.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.3 Receiving Incoming Calls

   When you configure ppp to receive incoming calls on a machine connected to
   a LAN, you must decide if you wish to forward packets to the LAN. If you
   do, you should allocate the peer an IP number from your LAN's subnet, and
   use the command enable proxy in your /etc/ppp/ppp.conf file. You should
   also confirm that the /etc/rc.conf file contains the following:

 gateway_enable="YES"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.4 Which getty?

   Configuring DragonFly for Dial-up Services provides a good description on
   enabling dial-up services using getty(8).

   An alternative to getty is mgetty, a smarter version of getty designed
   with dial-up lines in mind.

   The advantages of using mgetty is that it actively talks to modems,
   meaning if port is turned off in /etc/ttys then your modem will not answer
   the phone.

   Later versions of mgetty (from 0.99beta onwards) also support the
   automatic detection of PPP streams, allowing your clients script-less
   access to your server.

   Refer to Mgetty and AutoPPP for more information on mgetty.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.5 PPP Permissions

   The ppp command must normally be run as the root user. If however, you
   wish to allow ppp to run in server mode as a normal user by executing ppp
   as described below, that user must be given permission to run ppp by
   adding them to the network group in /etc/group.

   You will also need to give them access to one or more sections of the
   configuration file using the allow command:

 allow users fred mary

   If this command is used in the default section, it gives the specified
   users access to everything.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.6 PPP Shells for Dynamic-IP Users

   Create a file called /etc/ppp/ppp-shell containing the following:

 #!/bin/sh
 IDENT=`echo $0 | sed -e 's/^.*-\(.*\)$/\1/'`
 CALLEDAS="$IDENT"
 TTY=`tty`

 if [ x$IDENT = xdialup ]; then
         IDENT=`basename $TTY`
 fi

 echo "PPP for $CALLEDAS on $TTY"
 echo "Starting PPP for $IDENT"

 exec /usr/sbin/ppp -direct $IDENT

   This script should be executable. Now make a symbolic link called
   ppp-dialup to this script using the following commands:

 # ln -s ppp-shell /etc/ppp/ppp-dialup

   You should use this script as the shell for all of your dialup users. This
   is an example from /etc/password for a dialup PPP user with username
   pchilds (remember do not directly edit the password file, use vipw).

 pchilds:*:1011:300:Peter Childs PPP:/home/ppp:/etc/ppp/ppp-dialup

   Create a /home/ppp directory that is world readable containing the
   following 0 byte files:

 -r--r--r--   1 root     wheel           0 May 27 02:23 .hushlogin
 -r--r--r--   1 root     wheel           0 May 27 02:22 .rhosts

   which prevents /etc/motd from being displayed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.7 PPP Shells for Static-IP Users

   Create the ppp-shell file as above, and for each account with statically
   assigned IPs create a symbolic link to ppp-shell.

   For example, if you have three dialup customers, fred, sam, and mary, that
   you route class C networks for, you would type the following:

 # ln -s /etc/ppp/ppp-shell /etc/ppp/ppp-fred
 # ln -s /etc/ppp/ppp-shell /etc/ppp/ppp-sam
 # ln -s /etc/ppp/ppp-shell /etc/ppp/ppp-mary

   Each of these users dialup accounts should have their shell set to the
   symbolic link created above (for example, mary's shell should be
   /etc/ppp/ppp-mary).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.8 Setting Up ppp.conf for Dynamic-IP Users

   The /etc/ppp/ppp.conf file should contain something along the lines of:

 default:
   set debug phase lcp chat
   set timeout 0

 ttyd0:
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.100.20 255.255.255.255
   enable proxy

 ttyd1:
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.100.21 255.255.255.255
   enable proxy

     Note: The indenting is important.

   The default: section is loaded for each session. For each dialup line
   enabled in /etc/ttys create an entry similar to the one for ttyd0: above.
   Each line should get a unique IP address from your pool of IP addresses
   for dynamic users.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.9 Setting Up ppp.conf for Static-IP Users

   Along with the contents of the sample /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf
   above you should add a section for each of the statically assigned dialup
   users. We will continue with our fred, sam, and mary example.

 fred:
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.101.1 255.255.255.255

 sam:
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.102.1 255.255.255.255

 mary:
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.103.1 255.255.255.255

   The file /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup should also contain routing information for
   each static IP user if required. The line below would add a route for the
   203.14.101.0 class C via the client's ppp link.

 fred:
   add 203.14.101.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 HISADDR

 sam:
   add 203.14.102.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 HISADDR

 mary:
   add 203.14.103.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 HISADDR

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.10 mgetty and AutoPPP

   Configuring and compiling mgetty with the AUTO_PPP option enabled allows
   mgetty to detect the LCP phase of PPP connections and automatically spawn
   off a ppp shell. However, since the default login/password sequence does
   not occur it is necessary to authenticate users using either PAP or CHAP.

   This section assumes the user has successfully configured, compiled, and
   installed a version of mgetty with the AUTO_PPP option (v0.99beta or
   later).

   Make sure your /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config file has the
   following in it:

 /AutoPPP/ -     -                     /etc/ppp/ppp-pap-dialup

   This will tell mgetty to run the ppp-pap-dialup script for detected PPP
   connections.

   Create a file called /etc/ppp/ppp-pap-dialup containing the following (the
   file should be executable):

 #!/bin/sh
 exec /usr/sbin/ppp -direct pap$IDENT

   For each dialup line enabled in /etc/ttys, create a corresponding entry in
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf. This will happily co-exist with the definitions we
   created above.

 pap:
   enable pap         
   set ifaddr 203.14.100.1 203.14.100.20-203.14.100.40
   enable proxy

   Each user logging in with this method will need to have a
   username/password in /etc/ppp/ppp.secret file, or alternatively add the
   following option to authenticate users via PAP from /etc/password file.

 enable passwdauth

   If you wish to assign some users a static IP number, you can specify the
   number as the third argument in /etc/ppp/ppp.secret. See
   /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.secret.sample for examples.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.11 MS Extensions

   It is possible to configure PPP to supply DNS and NetBIOS nameserver
   addresses on demand.

   To enable these extensions with PPP version 1.x, the following lines might
   be added to the relevant section of /etc/ppp/ppp.conf.

 enable msext
 set ns 203.14.100.1 203.14.100.2
 set nbns 203.14.100.5

   And for PPP version 2 and above:

 accept dns
 set dns 203.14.100.1 203.14.100.2
 set nbns 203.14.100.5

   This will tell the clients the primary and secondary name server
   addresses, and a NetBIOS nameserver host.

   In version 2 and above, if the set dns line is omitted, PPP will use the
   values found in /etc/resolv.conf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.12 PAP and CHAP Authentication

   Some ISPs set their system up so that the authentication part of your
   connection is done using either of the PAP or CHAP authentication
   mechanisms. If this is the case, your ISP will not give a login: prompt
   when you connect, but will start talking PPP immediately.

   PAP is less secure than CHAP, but security is not normally an issue here
   as passwords, although being sent as plain text with PAP, are being
   transmitted down a serial line only. There is not much room for crackers
   to ``eavesdrop''.

   Referring back to the PPP and Static IP addresses or PPP and Dynamic IP
   addresses sections, the following alterations must be made:

 13      set authname MyUserName
 14      set authkey MyPassword
 15      set login

   Line 13:

           This line specifies your PAP/CHAP user name. You will need to
           insert the correct value for MyUserName.

   Line 14:

           This line specifies your PAP/CHAP password. You will need to
           insert the correct value for MyPassword. You may want to add an
           additional line, such as:

 16      accept PAP

           or

 16      accept CHAP

           to make it obvious that this is the intention, but PAP and CHAP
           are both accepted by default.

   Line 15:

           Your ISP will not normally require that you log into the server if
           you are using PAP or CHAP. You must therefore disable your ``set
           login'' string.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.2.1.3.13 Changing Your ppp Configuration on the Fly

   It is possible to talk to the ppp program while it is running in the
   background, but only if a suitable diagnostic port has been set up. To do
   this, add the following line to your configuration:

 set server /var/run/ppp-tun%d DiagnosticPassword 0177

   This will tell PPP to listen to the specified UNIX domain socket, asking
   clients for the specified password before allowing access. The %d in the
   name is replaced with the tun device number that is in use.

   Once a socket has been set up, the pppctl(8) program may be used in
   scripts that wish to manipulate the running program.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.2.1.4 Using PPP Network Address Translation Capability

   PPP has ability to use internal NAT without kernel diverting capabilities.
   This functionality may be enabled by the following line in
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf:

 nat enable yes

   Alternatively, PPP NAT may be enabled by command-line option -nat. There
   is also /etc/rc.conf knob named ppp_nat, which is enabled by default.

   If you use this feature, you may also find useful the following
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf options to enable incoming connections forwarding:

 nat port tcp 10.0.0.2:ftp ftp
 nat port tcp 10.0.0.2:http http

   or do not trust the outside at all

 nat deny_incoming yes

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.2.1.5 Final System Configuration

   You now have ppp configured, but there are a few more things to do before
   it is ready to work. They all involve editing the /etc/rc.conf file.

   Working from the top down in this file, make sure the hostname= line is
   set, e.g.:

 hostname="foo.example.com"

   If your ISP has supplied you with a static IP address and name, it is
   probably best that you use this name as your host name.

   Look for the network_interfaces variable. If you want to configure your
   system to dial your ISP on demand, make sure the tun0 device is added to
   the list, otherwise remove it.

 network_interfaces="lo0 tun0"
 ifconfig_tun0=

     Note: The ifconfig_tun0 variable should be empty, and a file called
     /etc/start_if.tun0 should be created. This file should contain the line:

 ppp -auto mysystem

     This script is executed at network configuration time, starting your ppp
     daemon in automatic mode. If you have a LAN for which this machine is a
     gateway, you may also wish to use the -alias switch. Refer to the manual
     page for further details.

   Make sure the router program set to NO with following line in your
   /etc/rc.conf:

 router_enable="NO"

   It is important that the routed daemon is not started (it is by default),
   as routed tends to delete the default routing table entries created by
   ppp.

   It is probably worth your while ensuring that the sendmail_flags line does
   not include the -q option, otherwise sendmail will attempt to do a network
   lookup every now and then, possibly causing your machine to dial out. You
   may try:

 sendmail_flags="-bd"

   The downside of this is that you must force sendmail to re-examine the
   mail queue whenever the ppp link is up by typing:

 # /usr/sbin/sendmail -q

   You may wish to use the !bg command in ppp.linkup to do this
   automatically:

 1     provider:
 2       delete ALL
 3       add 0 0 HISADDR
 4       !bg sendmail -bd -q30m

   If you do not like this, it is possible to set up a ``dfilter'' to block
   SMTP traffic. Refer to the sample files for further details.

   All that is left is to reboot the machine. After rebooting, you can now
   either type:

 # ppp

   and then dial provider to start the PPP session, or, if you want ppp to
   establish sessions automatically when there is outbound traffic (and you
   have not created the start_if.tun0 script), type:

 # ppp -auto provider

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.2.1.6 Summary

   To recap, the following steps are necessary when setting up ppp for the
   first time:

   Client side:

    1. Ensure that the tun device is built into your kernel.

    2. Ensure that the tunN device file is available in the /dev directory.

    3. Create an entry in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf. The pmdemand example should
       suffice for most ISPs.

    4. If you have a dynamic IP address, create an entry in
       /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup.

    5. Update your /etc/rc.conf file.

    6. Create a start_if.tun0 script if you require demand dialing.

   Server side:

    1. Ensure that the tun device is built into your kernel.

    2. Ensure that the tunN device file is available in the /dev directory.

    3. Create an entry in /etc/passwd (using the vipw(8) program).

    4. Create a profile in this users home directory that runs ppp -direct
       direct-server or similar.

    5. Create an entry in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf. The direct-server example should
       suffice.

    6. Create an entry in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup.

    7. Update your /etc/rc.conf file.

18.3 Using Kernel PPP

   Parts originally contributed by Gennady B. Sorokopud and Robert Huff.

  18.3.1 Setting Up Kernel PPP

   Before you start setting up PPP on your machine, make sure that pppd is
   located in /usr/sbin and the directory /etc/ppp exists.

   pppd can work in two modes:

    1. As a ``client'' -- you want to connect your machine to the outside
       world via a PPP serial connection or modem line.

    2. As a ``server'' -- your machine is located on the network, and is used
       to connect other computers using PPP.

   In both cases you will need to set up an options file (/etc/ppp/options or
   ~/.ppprc if you have more than one user on your machine that uses PPP).

   You will also need some modem/serial software (preferably comms/kermit),
   so you can dial and establish a connection with the remote host.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.3.2 Using pppd as a Client

   Based on information provided by Trev Roydhouse.

   The following /etc/ppp/options might be used to connect to a Cisco
   terminal server PPP line.

 crtscts         # enable hardware flow control
 modem           # modem control line
 noipdefault     # remote PPP server must supply your IP address
                 # if the remote host does not send your IP during IPCP
                 # negotiation, remove this option
 passive         # wait for LCP packets
 domain ppp.foo.com      # put your domain name here

 :<remote_ip>    # put the IP of remote PPP host here
                 # it will be used to route packets via PPP link
                 # if you didn't specified the noipdefault option
                 # change this line to <local_ip>:<remote_ip>

 defaultroute    # put this if you want that PPP server will be your
                 # default router

   To connect:

    1. Dial to the remote host using kermit (or some other modem program),
       and enter your user name and password (or whatever is needed to enable
       PPP on the remote host).

    2. Exit kermit (without hanging up the line).

    3. Enter the following:

 # /usr/src/usr.sbin/pppd.new/pppd /dev/tty01 19200

       Be sure to use the appropriate speed and device name.

   Now your computer is connected with PPP. If the connection fails, you can
   add the debug option to the /etc/ppp/options file, and check console
   messages to track the problem.

   Following /etc/ppp/pppup script will make all 3 stages automatic:

 #!/bin/sh
 ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing pppd, PID=' ${pid}
         kill ${pid}
 fi
 ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing kermit, PID=' ${pid}
         kill -9 ${pid}
 fi

 ifconfig ppp0 down
 ifconfig ppp0 delete

 kermit -y /etc/ppp/kermit.dial
 pppd /dev/tty01 19200

   /etc/ppp/kermit.dial is a kermit script that dials and makes all necessary
   authorization on the remote host (an example of such a script is attached
   to the end of this document).

   Use the following /etc/ppp/pppdown script to disconnect the PPP line:

 #!/bin/sh
 pid=`ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ X${pid} != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing pppd, PID=' ${pid}
         kill -TERM ${pid}
 fi

 ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing kermit, PID=' ${pid}
         kill -9 ${pid}
 fi

 /sbin/ifconfig ppp0 down
 /sbin/ifconfig ppp0 delete
 kermit -y /etc/ppp/kermit.hup
 /etc/ppp/ppptest

   Check to see if pppd is still running by executing /usr/etc/ppp/ppptest,
   which should look like this:

 #!/bin/sh
 pid=`ps ax| grep pppd |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ X${pid} != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'pppd running: PID=' ${pid-NONE}
 else
         echo 'No pppd running.'
 fi
 set -x
 netstat -n -I ppp0
 ifconfig ppp0

   To hang up the modem, execute /etc/ppp/kermit.hup, which should contain:

 set line /dev/tty01     ; put your modem device here
 set speed 19200
 set file type binary
 set file names literal
 set win 8
 set rec pack 1024
 set send pack 1024
 set block 3
 set term bytesize 8
 set command bytesize 8
 set flow none

 pau 1
 out +++
 inp 5 OK
 out ATH0\13
 echo \13
 exit

   Here is an alternate method using chat instead of kermit:

   The following two files are sufficient to accomplish a pppd connection.

   /etc/ppp/options:

 /dev/cuaa1 115200

 crtscts         # enable hardware flow control
 modem           # modem control line
 connect "/usr/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/login.chat.script"
 noipdefault     # remote PPP serve must supply your IP address
                 # if the remote host doesn't send your IP during
                 # IPCP negotiation, remove this option
 passive         # wait for LCP packets
 domain <your.domain>      # put your domain name here

 :               # put the IP of remote PPP host here
                 # it will be used to route packets via PPP link
                 # if you didn't specified the noipdefault option
                 # change this line to <local_ip>:<remote_ip>

 defaultroute    # put this if you want that PPP server will be
                 # your default router

   /etc/ppp/login.chat.script:

     Note: The following should go on a single line.

 ABORT BUSY ABORT 'NO CARRIER' "" AT OK ATDT<phone.number>
   CONNECT "" TIMEOUT 10 ogin:-\\r-ogin: <login-id>
   TIMEOUT 5 sword: <password>

   Once these are installed and modified correctly, all you need to do is run
   pppd, like so:

 # pppd

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.3.3 Using pppd as a Server

   /etc/ppp/options should contain something similar to the following:

 crtscts                         # Hardware flow control
 netmask 255.255.255.0           # netmask (not required)
 192.114.208.20:192.114.208.165  # IP's of local and remote hosts
                                 # local ip must be different from one
                                 # you assigned to the ethernet (or other)
                                 # interface on your machine.
                                 # remote IP is IP address that will be
                                 # assigned to the remote machine
 domain ppp.foo.com              # your domain
 passive                         # wait for LCP
 modem                           # modem line

   The following /etc/ppp/pppserv script will tell pppd to behave as a
   server:

 #!/bin/sh
 ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing pppd, PID=' ${pid}
         kill ${pid}
 fi
 ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing kermit, PID=' ${pid}
         kill -9 ${pid}
 fi

 # reset ppp interface
 ifconfig ppp0 down
 ifconfig ppp0 delete

 # enable autoanswer mode
 kermit -y /etc/ppp/kermit.ans

 # run ppp
 pppd /dev/tty01 19200

   Use this /etc/ppp/pppservdown script to stop the server:

 #!/bin/sh
 ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep pppd |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing pppd, PID=' ${pid}
         kill ${pid}
 fi
 ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep
 pid=`ps ax |grep kermit |grep -v grep|awk '{print $1;}'`
 if [ "X${pid}" != "X" ] ; then
         echo 'killing kermit, PID=' ${pid}
         kill -9 ${pid}
 fi
 ifconfig ppp0 down
 ifconfig ppp0 delete

 kermit -y /etc/ppp/kermit.noans

   The following kermit script (/etc/ppp/kermit.ans) will enable/disable
   autoanswer mode on your modem. It should look like this:

 set line /dev/tty01
 set speed 19200
 set file type binary
 set file names literal
 set win 8
 set rec pack 1024
 set send pack 1024
 set block 3
 set term bytesize 8
 set command bytesize 8
 set flow none

 pau 1

 inp 5 OK
 out ATH0\13
 inp 5 OK
 echo \13
 out ATS0=1\13   ; change this to out ATS0=0\13 if you want to disable
                 ; autoanswer mode
 inp 5 OK
 echo \13
 exit

   A script named /etc/ppp/kermit.dial is used for dialing and authenticating
   on the remote host. You will need to customize it for your needs. Put your
   login and password in this script; you will also need to change the input
   statement depending on responses from your modem and remote host.

18.4 Troubleshooting PPP Connections

   Contributed by Tom Rhodes.

   This section covers a few issues which may arise when using PPP over a
   modem connection. For instance, perhaps you need to know exactly what
   prompts the system you are dialing into will present. Some ISPs present
   the ssword prompt, and others will present password; if the ppp script is
   not written accordingly, the login attempt will fail. The most common way
   to debug ppp connections is by connecting manually. The following
   information will walk you through a manual connection step by step.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.4.1 Check the Device Nodes

   If you reconfigured your kernel then you recall the sio device. If you did
   not configure your kernel, there is no reason to worry. Just check the
   dmesg output for the modem device with:

 #dmesg | grep sio

   You should get some pertinent output about the sio devices. These are the
   COM ports we need. If your modem acts like a standard serial port then you
   should see it listed on sio1, or COM2. If so, you are not required to
   rebuild the kernel, you just need to make the serial device. You can do
   this by changing your directory to /dev and running the MAKEDEV script
   like above. Now make the serial devices with:

 # sh MAKEDEV cuaa0 cuaa1 cuaa2 cuaa3

   which will create the serial devices for your system. When matching up sio
   modem is on sio1 or COM2 if you are in DOS, then your modem device would
   be /dev/cuaa1.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.4.2 Connecting Manually

   Connecting to the Internet by manually controlling ppp is quick, easy, and
   a great way to debug a connection or just get information on how your ISP
   treats ppp client connections. Lets start PPP from the command line. Note
   that in all of our examples we will use example as the hostname of the
   machine running PPP. You start ppp by just typing ppp:

 # ppp

   We have now started ppp.

 ppp ON example> set device /dev/cuaa1

   We set our modem device, in this case it is cuaa1.

 ppp ON example> set speed 115200

   Set the connection speed, in this case we are using 115,200 kbps.

 ppp ON example> enable dns

   Tell ppp to configure our resolver and add the nameserver lines to
   /etc/resolv.conf. If ppp cannot determine our hostname, we can set one
   manually later.

 ppp ON example> term

   Switch to ``terminal'' mode so that we can manually control the modem.

 deflink: Entering terminal mode on /dev/cuaa1
 type '~h' for help

 at
         OK
         atdt123456789

   Use at to initialize the modem, then use atdt and the number for your ISP
   to begin the dial in process.

 CONNECT

   Confirmation of the connection, if we are going to have any connection
   problems, unrelated to hardware, here is where we will attempt to resolve
   them.

 ISP Login:myusername

   Here you are prompted for a username, return the prompt with the username
   that was provided by the ISP.

 ISP Pass:mypassword

   This time we are prompted for a password, just reply with the password
   that was provided by the ISP. Just like logging into DragonFly, the
   password will not echo.

 Shell or PPP:ppp

   Depending on your ISP this prompt may never appear. Here we are being
   asked if we wish to use a shell on the provider, or to start ppp. In this
   example, we have chosen to use ppp as we want an Internet connection.

 Ppp ON example>

   Notice that in this example the first p has been capitalized. This shows
   that we have successfully connected to the ISP.

 PPp ON example>

   We have successfully authenticated with our ISP and are waiting for the
   assigned IP address.

 PPP ON example>

   We have made an agreement on an IP address and successfully completed our
   connection.

 PPP ON example>add default HISADDR

   Here we add our default route, we need to do this before we can talk to
   the outside world as currently the only established connection is with the
   peer. If this fails due to existing routes you can put a bang character !
   in front of the add. Alternatively, you can set this before making the
   actual connection and it will negotiate a new route accordingly.

   If everything went good we should now have an active connection to the
   Internet, which could be thrown into the background using CTRL+z If you
   notice the PPP return to ppp then we have lost our connection. This is
   good to know because it shows our connection status. Capital P's show that
   we have a connection to the ISP and lowercase p's show that the connection
   has been lost for whatever reason. ppp only has these 2 states.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.4.2.1 Debugging

   If you have a direct line and cannot seem to make a connection, then turn
   hardware flow CTS/RTS to off with the set ctsrts off. This is mainly the
   case if you are connected to some PPP capable terminal servers, where PPP
   hangs when it tries to write data to your communication link, so it would
   be waiting for a CTS, or Clear To Send signal which may never come. If you
   use this option however, you should also use the set accmap option, which
   may be required to defeat hardware dependent on passing certain characters
   from end to end, most of the time XON/XOFF. See the ppp(8) manual page for
   more information on this option, and how it is used.

   If you have an older modem, you may need to use the set parity even.
   Parity is set at none be default, but is used for error checking (with a
   large increase in traffic) on older modems and some ISPs. You may need
   this option for the Compuserve ISP.

   PPP may not return to the command mode, which is usually a negotiation
   error where the ISP is waiting for your side to start negotiating. At this
   point, using the ~p command will force ppp to start sending the
   configuration information.

   If you never obtain a login prompt, then most likely you need to use PAP
   or CHAP authentication instead of the UNIX style in the example above. To
   use PAP or CHAP just add the following options to PPP before going into
   terminal mode:

 ppp ON example> set authname myusername

   Where myusername should be replaced with the username that was assigned by
   the ISP.

 ppp ON example> set authkey mypassword

   Where mypassword should be replaced with the password that was assigned by
   the ISP.

   If you connect fine, but cannot seem to find any domain name, try to use
   ping(8) with an IP address and see if you can get any return information.
   If you experience 100 percent (100%) packet loss, then it is most likely
   that you were not assigned a default route. Double check that the option
   add default HISADDR was set during the connection. If you can connect to a
   remote IP address then it is possible that a resolver address has not been
   added to the /etc/resolv.conf. This file should look like:

 domain example.com
 nameserver x.x.x.x
 nameserver y.y.y.y

   Where x.x.x.x and y.y.y.y should be replaced with the IP address of your
   ISP's DNS servers. This information may or may not have been provided when
   you signed up, but a quick call to your ISP should remedy that.

   You could also have syslog(3) provide a logging function for your PPP
   connection. Just add:

 !ppp
 *.*     /var/log/ppp.log

   to /etc/syslog.conf. In most cases, this functionality already exists.

18.5 Using PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)

   Contributed (from
   http://node.to/freebsd/how-tos/how-to-freebsd-pppoe.html) by Jim Mock.

   This section describes how to set up PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.1 Configuring the Kernel

   No kernel configuration is necessary for PPPoE any longer. If the
   necessary netgraph support is not built into the kernel, it will be
   dynamically loaded by ppp.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.2 Setting Up ppp.conf

   Here is an example of a working ppp.conf:

 default:
   set log Phase tun command # you can add more detailed logging if you wish
   set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0

 name_of_service_provider:
   set device PPPoE:xl1 # replace xl1 with your ethernet device
   set authname YOURLOGINNAME
   set authkey YOURPASSWORD
   set dial
   set login
   add default HISADDR

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.3 Running ppp

   As root, you can run:

 # ppp -ddial name_of_service_provider

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.4 Starting ppp at Boot

   Add the following to your /etc/rc.conf file:

 ppp_enable="YES"
 ppp_mode="ddial"
 ppp_nat="YES"   # if you want to enable nat for your local network, otherwise NO
 ppp_profile="name_of_service_provider"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.5 Using a PPPoE Service Tag

   Sometimes it will be necessary to use a service tag to establish your
   connection. Service tags are used to distinguish between different PPPoE
   servers attached to a given network.

   You should have been given any required service tag information in the
   documentation provided by your ISP. If you cannot locate it there, ask
   your ISP's tech support personnel.

   As a last resort, you could try the method suggested by the Roaring
   Penguin PPPoE program which can be found in the pkgsrc collection. Bear in
   mind however, this may de-program your modem and render it useless, so
   think twice before doing it. Simply install the program shipped with the
   modem by your provider. Then, access the System menu from the program. The
   name of your profile should be listed there. It is usually ISP.

   The profile name (service tag) will be used in the PPPoE configuration
   entry in ppp.conf as the provider part of the set device command (see the
   ppp(8) manual page for full details). It should look like this:

 set device PPPoE:xl1:ISP

   Do not forget to change xl1 to the proper device for your Ethernet card.

   Do not forget to change ISP to the profile you have just found above.

   For additional information, see:

     * Cheaper Broadband with FreeBSD on DSL by Renaud Waldura.

     * Nutzung von T-DSL und T-Online mit FreeBSD by Udo Erdelhoff (in
       German).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.5.6 PPPoE with a 3Com(R) HomeConnect(R) ADSL Modem Dual Link

   This modem does not follow RFC 2516 (A Method for transmitting PPP over
   Ethernet (PPPoE), written by L. Mamakos, K. Lidl, J. Evarts, D. Carrel, D.
   Simone, and R. Wheeler). Instead, different packet type codes have been
   used for the Ethernet frames. Please complain to 3Com if you think it
   should comply with the PPPoE specification.

   In order to make DragonFly capable of communicating with this device, a
   sysctl must be set. This can be done automatically at boot time by
   updating /etc/sysctl.conf:

 net.graph.nonstandard_pppoe=1

   or can be done for immediate effect with the command sysctl
   net.graph.nonstandard_pppoe=1.

   Unfortunately, because this is a system-wide setting, it is not possible
   to talk to a normal PPPoE client or server and a 3Com(R) HomeConnect(R)
   ADSL Modem at the same time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

18.6 Using SLIP

   Originally contributed by Satoshi Asami. With input from Guy Helmer and
   Piero Serini.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.6.1 Setting Up a SLIP Client

   The following is one way to set up a DragonFly machine for SLIP on a
   static host network. For dynamic hostname assignments (your address
   changes each time you dial up), you probably need to have a more complex
   setup.

   First, determine which serial port your modem is connected to. Many people
   set up a symbolic link, such as /dev/modem, to point to the real device
   name, /dev/cuaaN. This allows you to abstract the actual device name
   should you ever need to move the modem to a different port. It can become
   quite cumbersome when you need to fix a bunch of files in /etc and .kermrc
   files all over the system!

     Note: /dev/cuaa0 is COM1, cuaa1 is COM2, etc.

   Make sure you have the following in your kernel configuration file:

 pseudo-device   sl      1

   It is included in the GENERIC kernel, so this should not be a problem
   unless you have deleted it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.1.1 Things You Have to Do Only Once

    1. Add your home machine, the gateway and nameservers to your /etc/hosts
       file. Mine looks like this:

 127.0.0.1               localhost loghost
 136.152.64.181          water.CS.Example.EDU water.CS water
 136.152.64.1            inr-3.CS.Example.EDU inr-3 slip-gateway
 128.32.136.9            ns1.Example.EDU ns1
 128.32.136.12           ns2.Example.EDU ns2

    2. Make sure you have hosts before bind in your /etc/host.conf.

    3. Edit the /etc/rc.conf file.

         1. Set your hostname by editing the line that says:

 hostname="myname.my.domain"

            Your machine's full Internet hostname should be placed here.

         2. Add sl0 to the list of network interfaces by changing the line
            that says:

 network_interfaces="lo0"

            to:

 network_interfaces="lo0 sl0"

         3. Set the startup flags of sl0 by adding a line:

 ifconfig_sl0="inet ${hostname} slip-gateway netmask 0xffffff00 up"

         4. Designate the default router by changing the line:

 defaultrouter="NO"

            to:

 defaultrouter="slip-gateway"

    4. Make a file /etc/resolv.conf which contains:

 domain CS.Example.EDU
 nameserver 128.32.136.9
 nameserver 128.32.136.12

       As you can see, these set up the nameserver hosts. Of course, the
       actual domain names and addresses depend on your environment.

    5. Set the password for root and toor (and any other accounts that do not
       have a password).

    6. Reboot your machine and make sure it comes up with the correct
       hostname.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.1.2 Making a SLIP Connection

    1. Dial up, type slip at the prompt, enter your machine name and
       password. What is required to be entered depends on your environment.
       If you use kermit, you can try a script like this:

 # kermit setup
 set modem hayes
 set line /dev/modem
 set speed 115200
 set parity none
 set flow rts/cts
 set terminal bytesize 8
 set file type binary
 # The next macro will dial up and login
 define slip dial 643-9600, input 10 =>, if failure stop, -
 output slip\x0d, input 10 Username:, if failure stop, -
 output silvia\x0d, input 10 Password:, if failure stop, -
 output ***\x0d, echo \x0aCONNECTED\x0a

       Of course, you have to change the hostname and password to fit yours.
       After doing so, you can just type slip from the kermit prompt to
       connect.

         Note: Leaving your password in plain text anywhere in the filesystem
         is generally a bad idea. Do it at your own risk.

    2. Leave the kermit there (you can suspend it by Ctrl-z) and as root,
       type:

 # slattach -h -c -s 115200 /dev/modem

       If you are able to ping hosts on the other side of the router, you are
       connected! If it does not work, you might want to try -a instead of -c
       as an argument to slattach.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.1.3 How to Shutdown the Connection

   Do the following:

 # kill -INT `cat /var/run/slattach.modem.pid`

   to kill slattach. Keep in mind you must be root to do the above. Then go
   back to kermit (by running fg if you suspended it) and exit from it (q).

   The slattach manual page says you have to use ifconfig sl0 down to mark
   the interface down, but this does not seem to make any difference for me.
   (ifconfig sl0 reports the same thing.)

   Some times, your modem might refuse to drop the carrier (mine often does).
   In that case, simply start kermit and quit it again. It usually goes out
   on the second try.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.1.4 Troubleshooting

   If it does not work, feel free to ask me. The things that people tripped
   over so far:

     * Not using -c or -a in slattach (This should not be fatal, but some
       users have reported that this solves their problems.)

     * Using s10 instead of sl0 (might be hard to see the difference on some
       fonts).

     * Try ifconfig sl0 to see your interface status. For example, you might
       get:

 # ifconfig sl0
 sl0: flags=10<POINTOPOINT>
         inet 136.152.64.181 --> 136.152.64.1 netmask ffffff00

     * If you get ``no route to host'' messages from ping, there may be a
       problem with your routing table. You can use the netstat -r command to
       display the current routes :

 # netstat -r
 Routing tables
 Destination      Gateway            Flags     Refs     Use  IfaceMTU    Rtt    Netmasks:

 (root node)
 (root node)

 Route Tree for Protocol Family inet:
 (root node) =>
 default          inr-3.Example.EDU  UG          8   224515  sl0 -      -
 localhost.Exampl localhost.Example. UH          5    42127  lo0 -       0.438
 inr-3.Example.ED water.CS.Example.E UH          1        0  sl0 -      -
 water.CS.Example localhost.Example. UGH        34 47641234  lo0 -       0.438
 (root node)

       The preceding examples are from a relatively busy system. The numbers
       on your system will vary depending on network activity.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  18.6.2 Setting Up a SLIP Server

   This document provides suggestions for setting up SLIP Server services on
   a DragonFly system, which typically means configuring your system to
   automatically startup connections upon login for remote SLIP clients.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.2.1 Prerequisites

   This section is very technical in nature, so background knowledge is
   required. It is assumed that you are familiar with the TCP/IP network
   protocol, and in particular, network and node addressing, network address
   masks, subnetting, routing, and routing protocols, such as RIP.
   Configuring SLIP services on a dial-up server requires a knowledge of
   these concepts, and if you are not familiar with them, please read a copy
   of either Craig Hunt's TCP/IP Network Administration published by O'Reilly
   & Associates, Inc. (ISBN Number 0-937175-82-X), or Douglas Comer's books
   on the TCP/IP protocol.

   It is further assumed that you have already set up your modem(s) and
   configured the appropriate system files to allow logins through your
   modems. If you have not prepared your system for this yet, please see the
   tutorial for configuring dialup services. You may also want to check the
   manual pages for sio(4) for information on the serial port device driver
   and ttys(5), gettytab(5), getty(8), & init(8) for information relevant to
   configuring the system to accept logins on modems, and perhaps stty(1) for
   information on setting serial port parameters (such as clocal for
   directly-connected serial interfaces).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.2.2 Quick Overview

   In its typical configuration, using DragonFly as a SLIP server works as
   follows: a SLIP user dials up your DragonFly SLIP Server system and logs
   in with a special SLIP login ID that uses /usr/sbin/sliplogin as the
   special user's shell. The sliplogin program browses the file
   /etc/sliphome/slip.hosts to find a matching line for the special user, and
   if it finds a match, connects the serial line to an available SLIP
   interface and then runs the shell script /etc/sliphome/slip.login to
   configure the SLIP interface.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.2.1 An Example of a SLIP Server Login

   For example, if a SLIP user ID were Shelmerg, Shelmerg's entry in
   /etc/master.passwd would look something like this:

 Shelmerg:password:1964:89::0:0:Guy Helmer - SLIP:/usr/users/Shelmerg:/usr/sbin/sliplogin

   When Shelmerg logs in, sliplogin will search /etc/sliphome/slip.hosts for
   a line that had a matching user ID; for example, there may be a line in
   /etc/sliphome/slip.hosts that reads:

 Shelmerg        dc-slip sl-helmer       0xfffffc00                autocomp

   sliplogin will find that matching line, hook the serial line into the next
   available SLIP interface, and then execute /etc/sliphome/slip.login like
   this:

 /etc/sliphome/slip.login 0 19200 Shelmerg dc-slip sl-helmer 0xfffffc00 autocomp

   If all goes well, /etc/sliphome/slip.login will issue an ifconfig for the
   SLIP interface to which sliplogin attached itself (slip interface 0, in
   the above example, which was the first parameter in the list given to
   slip.login) to set the local IP address (dc-slip), remote IP address
   (sl-helmer), network mask for the SLIP interface (0xfffffc00), and any
   additional flags (autocomp). If something goes wrong, sliplogin usually
   logs good informational messages via the daemon syslog facility, which
   usually logs to /var/log/messages (see the manual pages for syslogd(8) and
   syslog.conf(5) and perhaps check /etc/syslog.conf to see to what syslogd
   is logging and where it is logging to).

   OK, enough of the examples -- let us dive into setting up the system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.2.3 Kernel Configuration

   DragonFly's default kernels usually come with two SLIP interfaces defined
   (sl0 and sl1); you can use netstat -i to see whether these interfaces are
   defined in your kernel.

   Sample output from netstat -i:

 Name  Mtu   Network     Address            Ipkts Ierrs    Opkts Oerrs  Coll
 ed0   1500  <Link>0.0.c0.2c.5f.4a         291311     0   174209     0   133
 ed0   1500  138.247.224 ivory             291311     0   174209     0   133
 lo0   65535 <Link>                            79     0       79     0     0
 lo0   65535 loop        localhost             79     0       79     0     0
 sl0*  296   <Link>                             0     0        0     0     0
 sl1*  296   <Link>                             0     0        0     0     0

   The sl0 and sl1 interfaces shown from netstat -i indicate that there are
   two SLIP interfaces built into the kernel. (The asterisks after the sl0
   and sl1 indicate that the interfaces are ``down''.)

   However, DragonFly's default kernel does not come configured to forward
   packets (by default, your DragonFly machine will not act as a router) due
   to Internet RFC requirements for Internet hosts (see RFCs 1009
   [Requirements for Internet Gateways], 1122 [Requirements for Internet
   Hosts -- Communication Layers], and perhaps 1127 [A Perspective on the
   Host Requirements RFCs]). If you want your DragonFly SLIP Server to act as
   a router, you will have to edit the /etc/rc.conf file and change the
   setting of the gateway_enable variable to YES.

   You will then need to reboot for the new settings to take effect.

   You will notice that near the end of the default kernel configuration file
   (/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC) is a line that reads:

 pseudo-device sl 2

   This is the line that defines the number of SLIP devices available in the
   kernel; the number at the end of the line is the maximum number of SLIP
   connections that may be operating simultaneously.

   Please refer to Chapter 9 on Configuring the DragonFly Kernel for help in
   reconfiguring your kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.2.4 Sliplogin Configuration

   As mentioned earlier, there are three files in the /etc/sliphome directory
   that are part of the configuration for /usr/sbin/sliplogin (see
   sliplogin(8) for the actual manual page for sliplogin): slip.hosts, which
   defines the SLIP users and their associated IP addresses; slip.login,
   which usually just configures the SLIP interface; and (optionally)
   slip.logout, which undoes slip.login's effects when the serial connection
   is terminated.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.4.1 slip.hosts Configuration

   /etc/sliphome/slip.hosts contains lines which have at least four items
   separated by whitespace:

     * SLIP user's login ID

     * Local address (local to the SLIP server) of the SLIP link

     * Remote address of the SLIP link

     * Network mask

   The local and remote addresses may be host names (resolved to IP addresses
   by /etc/hosts or by the domain name service, depending on your
   specifications in /etc/host.conf), and the network mask may be a name that
   can be resolved by a lookup into /etc/networks. On a sample system,
   /etc/sliphome/slip.hosts looks like this:

 #
 # login local-addr      remote-addr     mask            opt1    opt2
 #                                               (normal,compress,noicmp)
 #
 Shelmerg  dc-slip       sl-helmerg      0xfffffc00      autocomp

   At the end of the line is one or more of the options.

     * normal -- no header compression

     * compress -- compress headers

     * autocomp -- compress headers if the remote end allows it

     * noicmp -- disable ICMP packets (so any ``ping'' packets will be
       dropped instead of using up your bandwidth)

   Your choice of local and remote addresses for your SLIP links depends on
   whether you are going to dedicate a TCP/IP subnet or if you are going to
   use ``proxy ARP'' on your SLIP server (it is not ``true'' proxy ARP, but
   that is the terminology used in this section to describe it). If you are
   not sure which method to select or how to assign IP addresses, please
   refer to the TCP/IP books referenced in the SLIP Prerequisites (Section
   18.6.2.1) and/or consult your IP network manager.

   If you are going to use a separate subnet for your SLIP clients, you will
   need to allocate the subnet number out of your assigned IP network number
   and assign each of your SLIP client's IP numbers out of that subnet. Then,
   you will probably need to configure a static route to the SLIP subnet via
   your SLIP server on your nearest IP router.

   Otherwise, if you will use the ``proxy ARP'' method, you will need to
   assign your SLIP client's IP addresses out of your SLIP server's Ethernet
   subnet, and you will also need to adjust your /etc/sliphome/slip.login and
   /etc/sliphome/slip.logout scripts to use arp(8) to manage the proxy-ARP
   entries in the SLIP server's ARP table.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.4.2 slip.login Configuration

   The typical /etc/sliphome/slip.login file looks like this:

 #!/bin/sh -
 #
 #       @(#)slip.login  5.1 (Berkeley) 7/1/90

 #
 # generic login file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
 # the parameters:
 #      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
 #   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
 #
 /sbin/ifconfig sl$1 inet $4 $5 netmask $6

   This slip.login file merely runs ifconfig for the appropriate SLIP
   interface with the local and remote addresses and network mask of the SLIP
   interface.

   If you have decided to use the ``proxy ARP'' method (instead of using a
   separate subnet for your SLIP clients), your /etc/sliphome/slip.login file
   will need to look something like this:

 #!/bin/sh -
 #
 #       @(#)slip.login  5.1 (Berkeley) 7/1/90

 #
 # generic login file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
 # the parameters:
 #      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
 #   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
 #
 /sbin/ifconfig sl$1 inet $4 $5 netmask $6
 # Answer ARP requests for the SLIP client with our Ethernet addr
 /usr/sbin/arp -s $5 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub

   The additional line in this slip.login, arp -s $5 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub,
   creates an ARP entry in the SLIP server's ARP table. This ARP entry causes
   the SLIP server to respond with the SLIP server's Ethernet MAC address
   whenever another IP node on the Ethernet asks to speak to the SLIP
   client's IP address.

   When using the example above, be sure to replace the Ethernet MAC address
   (00:11:22:33:44:55) with the MAC address of your system's Ethernet card,
   or your ``proxy ARP'' will definitely not work! You can discover your SLIP
   server's Ethernet MAC address by looking at the results of running netstat
   -i; the second line of the output should look something like:

 ed0   1500  <Link>0.2.c1.28.5f.4a         191923  0   129457     0   116

   This indicates that this particular system's Ethernet MAC address is
   00:02:c1:28:5f:4a -- the periods in the Ethernet MAC address given by
   netstat -i must be changed to colons and leading zeros should be added to
   each single-digit hexadecimal number to convert the address into the form
   that arp(8) desires; see the manual page on arp(8) for complete
   information on usage.

     Note: When you create /etc/sliphome/slip.login and
     /etc/sliphome/slip.logout, the ``execute'' bit (chmod 755
     /etc/sliphome/slip.login /etc/sliphome/slip.logout) must be set, or
     sliplogin will be unable to execute it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.4.3 slip.logout Configuration

   /etc/sliphome/slip.logout is not strictly needed (unless you are
   implementing ``proxy ARP''), but if you decide to create it, this is an
   example of a basic slip.logout script:

 #!/bin/sh -
 #
 #       slip.logout

 #
 # logout file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
 # the parameters:
 #      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
 #   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
 #
 /sbin/ifconfig sl$1 down

   If you are using ``proxy ARP'', you will want to have
   /etc/sliphome/slip.logout remove the ARP entry for the SLIP client:

 #!/bin/sh -
 #
 #       @(#)slip.logout

 #
 # logout file for a slip line.  sliplogin invokes this with
 # the parameters:
 #      1        2         3        4          5         6     7-n
 #   slipunit ttyspeed loginname local-addr remote-addr mask opt-args
 #
 /sbin/ifconfig sl$1 down
 # Quit answering ARP requests for the SLIP client
 /usr/sbin/arp -d $5

   The arp -d $5 removes the ARP entry that the ``proxy ARP'' slip.login
   added when the SLIP client logged in.

   It bears repeating: make sure /etc/sliphome/slip.logout has the execute
   bit set after you create it (ie, chmod 755 /etc/sliphome/slip.logout).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    18.6.2.5 Routing Considerations

   If you are not using the ``proxy ARP'' method for routing packets between
   your SLIP clients and the rest of your network (and perhaps the Internet),
   you will probably have to add static routes to your closest default
   router(s) to route your SLIP client subnet via your SLIP server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.5.1 Static Routes

   Adding static routes to your nearest default routers can be troublesome
   (or impossible if you do not have authority to do so...). If you have a
   multiple-router network in your organization, some routers, such as those
   made by Cisco and Proteon, may not only need to be configured with the
   static route to the SLIP subnet, but also need to be told which static
   routes to tell other routers about, so some expertise and
   troubleshooting/tweaking may be necessary to get static-route-based
   routing to work.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      18.6.2.5.2 Running GateD(R)

     Note: GateD(R) is proprietary software now and will not be available as
     source code to the public anymore (more info on the GateD website). This
     section only exists to ensure backwards compatibility for those that are
     still using an older version.

   An alternative to the headaches of static routes is to install GateD on
   your DragonFly SLIP server and configure it to use the appropriate routing
   protocols (RIP/OSPF/BGP/EGP) to tell other routers about your SLIP subnet.
   You'll need to write a /etc/gated.conf file to configure your gated; here
   is a sample, similar to what the author used on a FreeBSD SLIP server:

 #
 # gated configuration file for dc.dsu.edu; for gated version 3.5alpha5
 # Only broadcast RIP information for xxx.xxx.yy out the ed Ethernet interface
 #
 #
 # tracing options
 #
 traceoptions "/var/tmp/gated.output" replace size 100k files 2 general ;

 rip yes {
   interface sl noripout noripin ;
   interface ed ripin ripout version 1 ;
   traceoptions route ;
 } ;

 #
 # Turn on a bunch of tracing info for the interface to the kernel:
 kernel {
   traceoptions remnants request routes info interface ;
 } ;

 #
 # Propagate the route to xxx.xxx.yy out the Ethernet interface via RIP
 #

 export proto rip interface ed {
   proto direct {
       xxx.xxx.yy mask 255.255.252.0 metric 1; # SLIP connections
   } ;
 } ;

 #
 # Accept routes from RIP via ed Ethernet interfaces
              
 import proto rip interface ed {
   all ;
 } ;

   The above sample gated.conf file broadcasts routing information regarding
   the SLIP subnet xxx.xxx.yy via RIP onto the Ethernet; if you are using a
   different Ethernet driver than the ed driver, you will need to change the
   references to the ed interface appropriately. This sample file also sets
   up tracing to /var/tmp/gated.output for debugging GateD's activity; you
   can certainly turn off the tracing options if GateD works OK for you. You
   will need to change the xxx.xxx.yy's into the network address of your own
   SLIP subnet (be sure to change the net mask in the proto direct clause as
   well).

   Once you have installed and configured GateD on your system, you will need
   to tell the DragonFly startup scripts to run GateD in place of routed. The
   easiest way to accomplish this is to set the router and router_flags
   variables in /etc/rc.conf. Please see the manual page for GateD for
   information on command-line parameters.

19.2 Gateways and Routes

   Contributed by Coranth Gryphon.

   For one machine to be able to find another over a network, there must be a
   mechanism in place to describe how to get from one to the other. This is
   called routing. A ``route'' is a defined pair of addresses: a
   ``destination'' and a ``gateway''. The pair indicates that if you are
   trying to get to this destination, communicate through this gateway. There
   are three types of destinations: individual hosts, subnets, and
   ``default''. The ``default route'' is used if none of the other routes
   apply. We will talk a little bit more about default routes later on. There
   are also three types of gateways: individual hosts, interfaces (also
   called ``links''), and Ethernet hardware addresses (MAC addresses).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.1 An Example

   To illustrate different aspects of routing, we will use the following
   example from netstat:

 % netstat -r
 Routing tables

 Destination      Gateway            Flags     Refs     Use     Netif Expire

 default          outside-gw         UGSc       37      418      ppp0
 localhost        localhost          UH          0      181       lo0
 test0            0:e0:b5:36:cf:4f   UHLW        5    63288       ed0     77
 10.20.30.255     link#1             UHLW        1     2421
 example.com      link#1             UC          0        0
 host1            0:e0:a8:37:8:1e    UHLW        3     4601       lo0
 host2            0:e0:a8:37:8:1e    UHLW        0        5       lo0 =>
 host2.example.com link#1             UC          0        0
 224              link#1             UC          0        0

   The first two lines specify the default route (which we will cover in the
   next section) and the localhost route.

   The interface (Netif column) that this routing table specifies to use for
   localhost is lo0, also known as the loopback device. This says to keep all
   traffic for this destination internal, rather than sending it out over the
   LAN, since it will only end up back where it started.

   The next thing that stands out are the addresses beginning with 0:e0:.
   These are Ethernet hardware addresses, which are also known as MAC
   addresses. DragonFly will automatically identify any hosts (test0 in the
   example) on the local Ethernet and add a route for that host, directly to
   it over the Ethernet interface, ed0. There is also a timeout (Expire
   column) associated with this type of route, which is used if we fail to
   hear from the host in a specific amount of time. When this happens, the
   route to this host will be automatically deleted. These hosts are
   identified using a mechanism known as RIP (Routing Information Protocol),
   which figures out routes to local hosts based upon a shortest path
   determination.

   DragonFly will also add subnet routes for the local subnet (10.20.30.255
   is the broadcast address for the subnet 10.20.30, and example.com is the
   domain name associated with that subnet). The designation link#1 refers to
   the first Ethernet card in the machine. You will notice no additional
   interface is specified for those.

   Both of these groups (local network hosts and local subnets) have their
   routes automatically configured by a daemon called routed. If this is not
   run, then only routes which are statically defined (i.e. entered
   explicitly) will exist.

   The host1 line refers to our host, which it knows by Ethernet address.
   Since we are the sending host, DragonFly knows to use the loopback
   interface (lo0) rather than sending it out over the Ethernet interface.

   The two host2 lines are an example of what happens when we use an
   ifconfig(8) alias (see the section on Ethernet for reasons why we would do
   this). The => symbol after the lo0 interface says that not only are we
   using the loopback (since this address also refers to the local host), but
   specifically it is an alias. Such routes only show up on the host that
   supports the alias; all other hosts on the local network will simply have
   a link#1 line for such routes.

   The final line (destination subnet 224) deals with multicasting, which
   will be covered in another section.

   Finally, various attributes of each route can be seen in the Flags column.
   Below is a short table of some of these flags and their meanings:

   U Up: The route is active.                                                 
   H Host: The route destination is a single host.                            
   G Gateway: Send anything for this destination on to this remote system,    
     which will figure out from there where to send it.                       
   S Static: This route was configured manually, not automatically generated  
     by the system.                                                           
   C Clone: Generates a new route based upon this route for machines we       
     connect to. This type of route is normally used for local networks.      
   W WasCloned: Indicated a route that was auto-configured based upon a local 
     area network (Clone) route.                                              
   L Link: Route involves references to Ethernet hardware.                    

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.2 Default Routes

   When the local system needs to make a connection to a remote host, it
   checks the routing table to determine if a known path exists. If the
   remote host falls into a subnet that we know how to reach (Cloned routes),
   then the system checks to see if it can connect along that interface.

   If all known paths fail, the system has one last option: the ``default''
   route. This route is a special type of gateway route (usually the only one
   present in the system), and is always marked with a c in the flags field.
   For hosts on a local area network, this gateway is set to whatever machine
   has a direct connection to the outside world (whether via PPP link, DSL,
   cable modem, T1, or another network interface).

   If you are configuring the default route for a machine which itself is
   functioning as the gateway to the outside world, then the default route
   will be the gateway machine at your Internet Service Provider's (ISP)
   site.

   Let us look at an example of default routes. This is a common
   configuration:

 [Local2]  <--ether-->  [Local1]  <--PPP--> [ISP-Serv]  <--ether-->  [T1-GW]
      

   The hosts Local1 and Local2 are at your site. Local1 is connected to an
   ISP via a dial up PPP connection. This PPP server computer is connected
   through a local area network to another gateway computer through an
   external interface to the ISPs Internet feed.

   The default routes for each of your machines will be:

    Host  Default Gateway Interface 
   Local2 Local1          Ethernet  
   Local1 T1-GW           PPP       

   A common question is ``Why (or how) would we set the T1-GW to be the
   default gateway for Local1, rather than the ISP server it is connected
   to?''.

   Remember, since the PPP interface is using an address on the ISP's local
   network for your side of the connection, routes for any other machines on
   the ISP's local network will be automatically generated. Hence, you will
   already know how to reach the T1-GW machine, so there is no need for the
   intermediate step of sending traffic to the ISP server.

   It is common to use the address X.X.X.1 as the gateway address for your
   local network. So (using the same example), if your local class-C address
   space was 10.20.30 and your ISP was using 10.9.9 then the default routes
   would be:

                Host                 Default Route    
   Local2 (10.20.30.2)            Local1 (10.20.30.1) 
   Local1 (10.20.30.1, 10.9.9.30) T1-GW (10.9.9.1)    

   You can easily define the default route via the /etc/rc.conf file. In our
   example, on the Local2 machine, we added the following line in
   /etc/rc.conf:

 defaultrouter="10.20.30.1"

   It is also possible to do it directly from the command line with the
   route(8) command:

 # route add default 10.20.30.1

   For more informations on manual manipulation of network routing tables,
   consult route(8) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.3 Dual Homed Hosts

   There is one other type of configuration that we should cover, and that is
   a host that sits on two different networks. Technically, any machine
   functioning as a gateway (in the example above, using a PPP connection)
   counts as a dual-homed host. But the term is really only used to refer to
   a machine that sits on two local-area networks.

   In one case, the machine has two Ethernet cards, each having an address on
   the separate subnets. Alternately, the machine may only have one Ethernet
   card, and be using ifconfig(8) aliasing. The former is used if two
   physically separate Ethernet networks are in use, the latter if there is
   one physical network segment, but two logically separate subnets.

   Either way, routing tables are set up so that each subnet knows that this
   machine is the defined gateway (inbound route) to the other subnet. This
   configuration, with the machine acting as a router between the two
   subnets, is often used when we need to implement packet filtering or
   firewall security in either or both directions.

   If you want this machine to actually forward packets between the two
   interfaces, you need to tell DragonFly to enable this ability. See the
   next section for more details on how to do this.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.4 Building a Router

   A network router is simply a system that forwards packets from one
   interface to another. This is not enabled by default in DragonFly. You can
   enable this feature by changing the following variable to YES in
   rc.conf(5):

 gateway_enable=YES          # Set to YES if this host will be a gateway

   This option will set the sysctl(8) variable net.inet.ip.forwarding to 1.
   If you should need to stop routing temporarily, you can reset this to 0
   temporarily.

   Your new router will need routes to know where to send the traffic. If
   your network is simple enough you can use static routes. DragonFly also
   comes with the standard BSD routing daemon routed(8), which speaks RIP
   (both version 1 and version 2) and IRDP. Support for BGP v4, OSPF v2, and
   other sophisticated routing protocols is available with the net/zebra
   package. Commercial products such as GateD are also available for more
   complex network routing solutions.

   Even when DragonFly is configured in this way, it does not completely
   comply with the Internet standard requirements for routers. It comes close
   enough for ordinary use, however.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.5 Setting Up Static Routes

   Contributed by Al Hoang.

    19.2.5.1 Manual Configuration

   Let us assume we have a network as follows:

     INTERNET
       | (10.0.0.1/24) Default Router to Internet
       |
       |Interface xl0
       |10.0.0.10/24
    +------+
    |      | RouterA
    |      | (DragonFly gateway)
    +------+
       | Interface xl1
       | 192.168.1.1/24
       |
   +--------------------------------+
    Internal Net 1      | 192.168.1.2/24
                        |
                    +------+
                    |      | RouterB
                    |      |
                    +------+
                        | 192.168.2.1/24
                        |
                      Internal Net 2
        

   In this scenario, RouterA is our DragonFly machine that is acting as a
   router to the rest of the Internet. It has a default route set to 10.0.0.1
   which allows it to connect with the outside world. We will assume that
   RouterB is already configured properly and knows how to get wherever it
   needs to go. (This is simple in this picture. Just add a default route on
   RouterB using 192.168.1.1 as the gateway.)

   If we look at the routing table for RouterA we would see something like
   the following:

 % netstat -nr
 Routing tables

 Internet:
 Destination        Gateway            Flags    Refs      Use  Netif  Expire
 default            10.0.0.1           UGS         0    49378    xl0
 127.0.0.1          127.0.0.1          UH          0        6    lo0
 10.0.0/24          link#1             UC          0        0    xl0
 192.168.1/24       link#2             UC          0        0    xl1

   With the current routing table RouterA will not be able to reach our
   Internal Net 2. It does not have a route for 192.168.2.0/24. One way to
   alleviate this is to manually add the route. The following command would
   add the Internal Net 2 network to RouterA's routing table using
   192.168.1.2 as the next hop:

 # route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2

   Now RouterA can reach any hosts on the 192.168.2.0/24 network.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.2.5.2 Persistent Configuration

   The above example is perfect for configuring a static route on a running
   system. However, one problem is that the routing information will not
   persist if you reboot your DragonFly machine. The way to handle the
   addition of a static route is to put it in your /etc/rc.conf file:

 # Add Internal Net 2 as a static route
 static_routes="internalnet2"
 route_internalnet2="-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2"

   The static_routes configuration variable is a list of strings seperated by
   a space. Each string references to a route name. In our above example we
   only have one string in static_routes. This string is internalnet2. We
   then add a configuration variable called route_internalnet2 where we put
   all of the configuration parameters we would give to the route(8) command.
   For our example above we would have used the command:

 # route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2

   so we need "-net 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.1.2".

   As said above, we can have more than one string in static_routes. This
   allows us to create multiple static routes. The following lines shows an
   example of adding static routes for the 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24
   networks on an imaginary router:

 static_routes="net1 net2"
 route_net1="-net 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.0.1"
 route_net2="-net 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.1"

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.6 Routing Propagation

   We have already talked about how we define our routes to the outside
   world, but not about how the outside world finds us.

   We already know that routing tables can be set up so that all traffic for
   a particular address space (in our examples, a class-C subnet) can be sent
   to a particular host on that network, which will forward the packets
   inbound.

   When you get an address space assigned to your site, your service provider
   will set up their routing tables so that all traffic for your subnet will
   be sent down your PPP link to your site. But how do sites across the
   country know to send to your ISP?

   There is a system (much like the distributed DNS information) that keeps
   track of all assigned address-spaces, and defines their point of
   connection to the Internet Backbone. The ``Backbone'' are the main trunk
   lines that carry Internet traffic across the country, and around the
   world. Each backbone machine has a copy of a master set of tables, which
   direct traffic for a particular network to a specific backbone carrier,
   and from there down the chain of service providers until it reaches your
   network.

   It is the task of your service provider to advertise to the backbone sites
   that they are the point of connection (and thus the path inward) for your
   site. This is known as route propagation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.7 Troubleshooting

   Sometimes, there is a problem with routing propagation, and some sites are
   unable to connect to you. Perhaps the most useful command for trying to
   figure out where routing is breaking down is the traceroute(8) command. It
   is equally useful if you cannot seem to make a connection to a remote
   machine (i.e. ping(8) fails).

   The traceroute(8) command is run with the name of the remote host you are
   trying to connect to. It will show the gateway hosts along the path of the
   attempt, eventually either reaching the target host, or terminating
   because of a lack of connection.

   For more information, see the manual page for traceroute(8).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.2.8 Multicast Routing

   DragonFly supports both multicast applications and multicast routing
   natively. Multicast applications do not require any special configuration
   of DragonFly; applications will generally run out of the box. Multicast
   routing requires that support be compiled into the kernel:

 options MROUTING

   In addition, the multicast routing daemon, mrouted(8) must be configured
   to set up tunnels and DVMRP via /etc/mrouted.conf. More details on
   multicast configuration may be found in the manual page for mrouted(8).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.3 Wireless Networking

   Written by Eric Anderson.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.3.1 Introduction

   It can be very useful to be able to use a computer without the annoyance
   of having a network cable attached at all times. DragonFly can be used as
   a wireless client, and even as a wireless ``access point''.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.3.2 Wireless Modes of Operation

   There are two different ways to configure 802.11 wireless devices: BSS and
   IBSS.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.2.1 BSS Mode

   BSS mode is the mode that typically is used. BSS mode is also called
   infrastructure mode. In this mode, a number of wireless access points are
   connected to a wired network. Each wireless network has its own name. This
   name is called the SSID of the network.

   Wireless clients connect to these wireless access points. The IEEE 802.11
   standard defines the protocol that wireless networks use to connect. A
   wireless client can be tied to a specific network, when a SSID is set. A
   wireless client can also attach to any network by not explicitly setting a
   SSID.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.2.2 IBSS Mode

   IBSS mode, also called ad-hoc mode, is designed for point to point
   connections. There are actually two types of ad-hoc mode. One is IBSS
   mode, also called ad-hoc or IEEE ad-hoc mode. This mode is defined by the
   IEEE 802.11 standards. The second is called demo ad-hoc mode or Lucent
   ad-hoc mode (and sometimes, confusingly, ad-hoc mode). This is the old,
   pre-802.11 ad-hoc mode and should only be used for legacy installations.
   We will not cover either of the ad-hoc modes further.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.3.3 Infrastructure Mode

    19.3.3.1 Access Points

   Access points are wireless networking devices that allow one or more
   wireless clients to use the device as a central hub. When using an access
   point, all clients communicate through the access point. Multiple access
   points are often used to cover a complete area such as a house, business,
   or park with a wireless network.

   Access points typically have multiple network connections: the wireless
   card, and one or more wired Ethernet adapters for connection to the rest
   of the network.

   Access points can either be purchased prebuilt, or you can build your own
   with DragonFly and a supported wireless card. Several vendors make
   wireless access points and wireless cards with various features.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.3.2 Building a DragonFly Access Point

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.2.1 Requirements

   In order to set up a wireless access point with DragonFly, you need to
   have a compatible wireless card. Currently, only cards with the Prism
   chipset are supported. You will also need a wired network card that is
   supported by DragonFly (this should not be difficult to find, DragonFly
   supports a lot of different devices). For this guide, we will assume you
   want to bridge(4) all traffic between the wireless device and the network
   attached to the wired network card.

   The hostap functionality that DragonFly uses to implement the access point
   works best with certain versions of firmware. Prism 2 cards should use
   firmware version 1.3.4 or newer. Prism 2.5 and Prism 3 cards should use
   firmware 1.4.9. Older versions of the firmware way or may not function
   correctly. At this time, the only way to update cards is with Windows
   firmware update utilities available from your card's manufacturer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.2.2 Setting It Up

   First, make sure your system can see the wireless card:

 # ifconfig -a
 wi0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet6 fe80::202:2dff:fe2d:c938%wi0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
         inet 0.0.0.0 netmask 0xff000000 broadcast 255.255.255.255
         ether 00:09:2d:2d:c9:50
         media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect (DS/2Mbps)
         status: no carrier
         ssid ""
         stationname "DragonFly Wireless node"
         channel 10 authmode OPEN powersavemode OFF powersavesleep 100
         wepmode OFF weptxkey 1

   Do not worry about the details now, just make sure it shows you something
   to indicate you have a wireless card installed. If you have trouble seeing
   the wireless interface, and you are using a PC Card, you may want to check
   out pccardc(8) and pccardd(8) manual pages for more information.

   Next, you will need to load a module in order to get the bridging part of
   DragonFly ready for the access point. To load the bridge(4) module, simply
   run the following command:

 # kldload bridge

   It should not have produced any errors when loading the module. If it did,
   you may need to compile the bridge(4) code into your kernel. The Bridging
   section of this handbook should be able to help you accomplish that task.

   Now that you have the bridging stuff done, we need to tell the DragonFly
   kernel which interfaces to bridge together. We do that by using sysctl(8):

 # sysctl net.link.ether.bridge=1
 # sysctl net.link.ether.bridge_cfg="wi0,xl0"
 # sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

   Now it is time for the wireless card setup. The following command will set
   the card into an access point:

 # ifconfig wi0 ssid my_net channel 11 media DS/11Mbps mediaopt hostap up stationname "DragonFly AP"
         

   The ifconfig(8) line brings the wi0 interface up, sets its SSID to my_net,
   and sets the station name to DragonFly AP. The media DS/11Mbps sets the
   card into 11Mbps mode and is needed for any mediaopt to take effect. The
   mediaopt hostap option places the interface into access point mode. The
   channel 11 option sets the 802.11b channel to use. The wicontrol(8) manual
   page has valid channel options for your regulatory domain.

   Now you should have a complete functioning access point up and running.
   You are encouraged to read wicontrol(8), ifconfig(8), and wi(4) for
   further information.

   It is also suggested that you read the section on encryption that follows.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.2.3 Status Information

   Once the access point is configured and operational, operators will want
   to see the clients that are associated with the access point. At any time,
   the operator may type:

 # wicontrol -l
 1 station:
 00:09:b7:7b:9d:16  asid=04c0, flags=3<ASSOC,AUTH>, caps=1<ESS>, rates=f<1M,2M,5.5M,11M>, sig=38/15

   This shows that there is one station associated, along with its
   parameters. The signal indicated should be used as a relative indication
   of strength only. Its translation to dBm or other units varies between
   different firmware revisions.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.3.3 Clients

   A wireless client is a system that accesses an access point or another
   client directly.

   Typically, wireless clients only have one network device, the wireless
   networking card.

   There are a few different ways to configure a wireless client. These are
   based on the different wireless modes, generally BSS (infrastructure mode,
   which requires an access point), and IBSS (ad-hoc, or peer-to-peer mode).
   In our example, we will use the most popular of the two, BSS mode, to talk
   to an access point.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.3.1 Requirements

   There is only one real requirement for setting up DragonFly as a wireless
   client. You will need a wireless card that is supported by DragonFly.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.3.2 Setting Up a Wireless DragonFly Client

   You will need to know a few things about the wireless network you are
   joining before you start. In this example, we are joining a network that
   has a name of my_net, and encryption turned off.

     Note: In this example, we are not using encryption, which is a dangerous
     situation. In the next section, you will learn how to turn on
     encryption, why it is important to do so, and why some encryption
     technologies still do not completely protect you.

   Make sure your card is recognized by DragonFly:

 # ifconfig -a
 wi0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet6 fe80::202:2dff:fe2d:c938%wi0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
         inet 0.0.0.0 netmask 0xff000000 broadcast 255.255.255.255
         ether 00:09:2d:2d:c9:50
         media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect (DS/2Mbps)
         status: no carrier
         ssid ""
         stationname "DragonFly Wireless node"
         channel 10 authmode OPEN powersavemode OFF powersavesleep 100
         wepmode OFF weptxkey 1

   Now, we can set the card to the correct settings for our network:

 # ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 255.255.255.0 ssid my_net

   Replace 192.168.0.20 and 255.255.255.0 with a valid IP address and netmask
   on your wired network. Remember, our access point is bridging the data
   between the wireless network, and the wired network, so it will appear to
   the other devices on your network that you are on the wired network just
   as they are.

   Once you have done that, you should be able to ping hosts on the wired
   network just as if you were connected using a standard wired connection.

   If you are experiencing problems with your wireless connection, check to
   make sure that your are associated (connected) to the access point:

 # ifconfig wi0

   should return some information, and you should see:

 status: associated

   If it does not show associated, then you may be out of range of the access
   point, have encryption on, or possibly have a configuration problem.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.3.4 Encryption

   Encryption on a wireless network is important because you no longer have
   the ability to keep the network contained in a well protected area. Your
   wireless data will be broadcast across your entire neighborhood, so anyone
   who cares to read it can. This is where encryption comes in. By encrypting
   the data that is sent over the airwaves, you make it much more difficult
   for any interested party to grab your data right out of the air.

   The two most common ways to encrypt the data between your client and the
   access point are WEP, and ipsec(4).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.4.1 WEP

   WEP is an abbreviation for Wired Equivalency Protocol. WEP is an attempt
   to make wireless networks as safe and secure as a wired network.
   Unfortunately, it has been cracked, and is fairly trivial to break. This
   also means it is not something to rely on when it comes to encrypting
   sensitive data.

   It is better than nothing, so use the following to turn on WEP on your new
   DragonFly access point:

 # ifconfig wi0 inet up ssid my_net wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 media DS/11Mbps mediaopt hostap

   And you can turn on WEP on a client with this command:

 # ifconfig wi0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 255.255.255.0 ssid my_net wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890

   Note that you should replace the 0x1234567890 with a more unique key.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.4.2 IPsec

   ipsec(4) is a much more robust and powerful tool for encrypting data
   across a network. This is definitely the preferred way to encrypt data
   over a wireless network. You can read more about ipsec(4) security and how
   to implement it in the IPsec section of this handbook.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.3.5 Tools

   There are a small number of tools available for use in debugging and
   setting up your wireless network, and here we will attempt to describe
   some of them and what they do.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.5.1 The wicontrol, ancontrol and raycontrol Utilities

   These are the tools you can use to control how your wireless card behaves
   on the wireless network. In the examples above, we have chosen to use
   wicontrol(8), since our wireless card is a wi0 interface. If you had a
   Cisco wireless device, it would come up as an0, and therefore you would
   use ancontrol(8).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.5.2 The ifconfig Command

   The ifconfig(8) command can be used to do many of the same options as
   wicontrol(8), however it does lack a few options. Check ifconfig(8) for
   command line parameters and options.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.3.3.6 Supported Cards

      19.3.3.6.1 Access Points

   The only cards that are currently supported for BSS (as an access point)
   mode are devices based on the Prism 2, 2.5, or 3 chipsets. For a complete
   list, look at wi(4).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.3.3.6.2 Clients

   Almost all 802.11b wireless cards are currently supported under DragonFly.
   Most cards based on Prism, Spectrum24, Hermes, Aironet, and Raylink will
   work as a wireless network card in IBSS (ad-hoc, peer-to-peer, and BSS)
   mode.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.4 Bluetooth

   Written by Pav Lucistnik.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.1 Introduction

   Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal networks
   operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a range of 10 meters.
   Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from portable devices such as cellular
   phones, handhelds and laptops. Unlike the other popular wireless
   technology, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth offers higher level service profiles, e.g.
   FTP-like file servers, file pushing, voice transport, serial line
   emulation, and more.

   The Bluetooth stack in DragonFly is implemented using the Netgraph
   framework (see netgraph(4)). A broad variety of Bluetooth USB dongles is
   supported by the ng_ubt(4) driver. The Broadcom BCM2033 chip based
   Bluetooth devices are supported via the ubtbcmfw(4) and ng_ubt(4) drivers.
   The 3Com Bluetooth PC Card 3CRWB60-A is supported by the ng_bt3c(4)
   driver. Serial and UART based Bluetooth devices are supported via sio(4),
   ng_h4(4) and hcseriald(8). This chapter describes the use of the USB
   Bluetooth dongle. Bluetooth support is available in DragonFly 5.0 and
   newer systems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.2 Plugging in the Device

   By default Bluetooth device drivers are available as kernel modules.
   Before attaching a device, you will need to load the driver into the
   kernel.

 # kldload ng_ubt

   If the Bluetooth device is present in the system during system startup,
   load the module from /boot/loader.conf.

 ng_ubt_load="YES"

   Plug in your USB dongle. The output similar to the following will appear
   on the console (or in syslog).

 ubt0: vendor 0x0a12 product 0x0001, rev 1.10/5.25, addr 2
 ubt0: Interface 0 endpoints: interrupt=0x81, bulk-in=0x82, bulk-out=0x2
 ubt0: Interface 1 (alt.config 5) endpoints: isoc-in=0x83, isoc-out=0x3,
       wMaxPacketSize=49, nframes=6, buffer size=294

   Copy /usr/share/examples/netgraph/bluetooth/rc.bluetooth into some
   convenient place, like /etc/rc.bluetooth. This script is used to start and
   stop the Bluetooth stack. It is a good idea to stop the stack before
   unplugging the device, but it is not (usually) fatal. When starting the
   stack, you will receive output similar to the following:

 # /etc/rc.bluetooth start ubt0
 BD_ADDR: 00:02:72:00:d4:1a
 Features: 0xff 0xff 0xf 00 00 00 00 00
 <3-Slot> <5-Slot> <Encryption> <Slot offset>
 <Timing accuracy> <Switch> <Hold mode> <Sniff mode>
 <Park mode> <RSSI> <Channel quality> <SCO link>
 <HV2 packets> <HV3 packets> <u-law log> <A-law log> <CVSD>
 <Paging scheme> <Power control> <Transparent SCO data>
 Max. ACL packet size: 192 bytes
 Number of ACL packets: 8
 Max. SCO packet size: 64 bytes
 Number of SCO packets: 8

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.3 Host Controller Interface (HCI)

   Host Controller Interface (HCI) provides a command interface to the
   baseband controller and link manager, and access to hardware status and
   control registers. This interface provides a uniform method of accessing
   the Bluetooth baseband capabilities. HCI layer on the Host exchanges data
   and commands with the HCI firmware on the Bluetooth hardware. The Host
   Controller Transport Layer (i.e. physical bus) driver provides both HCI
   layers with the ability to exchange information with each other.

   A single Netgraph node of type hci is created for a single Bluetooth
   device. The HCI node is normally connected to the Bluetooth device driver
   node (downstream) and the L2CAP node (upstream). All HCI operations must
   be performed on the HCI node and not on the device driver node. Default
   name for the HCI node is ``devicehci''. For more details refer to the
   ng_hci(4) man page.

   One of the most common tasks is discovery of Bluetooth devices in RF
   proximity. This operation is called inquiry. Inquiry and other HCI
   realated operations are done with the hccontrol(8) utility. The example
   below shows how to find out which Bluetooth devices are in range. You
   should receive the list of devices in a few seconds. Note that a remote
   device will only answer the inquiry if it put into discoverable mode.

 % hccontrol -n ubt0hci inquiry
 Inquiry result, num_responses=1
 Inquiry result #0
        BD_ADDR: 00:80:37:29:19:a4
        Page Scan Rep. Mode: 0x1
        Page Scan Period Mode: 00
        Page Scan Mode: 00
        Class: 52:02:04
        Clock offset: 0x78ef
 Inquiry complete. Status: No error [00]

   BD_ADDR is unique address of a Bluetooth device, similar to MAC addresses
   of a network card. This address is needed for further communication with a
   device. It is possible to assign human readable name to a BD_ADDR. The
   /etc/bluetooth/hosts file contains information regarding the known
   Bluetooth hosts. The following example shows how to obtain human readable
   name that was assigned to the remote device.

 % hccontrol -n ubt0hci remote_name_request 00:80:37:29:19:a4
 BD_ADDR: 00:80:37:29:19:a4
 Name: Pav's T39

   If you perform an inquiry on a remote Bluetooth device, it will find your
   computer as ``your.host.name (ubt0)''. The name assigned to the local
   device can be changed at any time.

   The Bluetooth system provides a point-to-point connection (only two
   Bluetooth units involved), or a point-to-multipoint connection. In the
   point-to-multipoint connection the connection is shared among several
   Bluetooth devices. The following example shows how to obtain the list of
   active baseband connections for the local device.

 % hccontrol -n ubt0hci read_connection_list
 Remote BD_ADDR    Handle Type Mode Role Encrypt Pending Queue State
 00:80:37:29:19:a4     41  ACL    0 MAST    NONE       0     0 OPEN

   A connection handle is useful when termination of the baseband connection
   is required. Note, that it is normally not required to do it by hand. The
   stack will automatically terminate inactive baseband connections.

 # hccontrol -n ubt0hci disconnect 41
 Connection handle: 41
 Reason: Connection terminated by local host [0x16]

   Refer to hccontrol help for a complete listing of available HCI commands.
   Most of the HCI commands do not require superuser privileges.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.4 Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)

   Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) provides
   connection-oriented and connectionless data services to upper layer
   protocols with protocol multiplexing capability and segmentation and
   reassembly operation. L2CAP permits higher level protocols and
   applications to transmit and receive L2CAP data packets up to 64 kilobytes
   in length.

   L2CAP is based around the concept of channels. Channel is a logical
   connection on top of baseband connection. Each channel is bound to a
   single protocol in a many-to-one fashion. Multiple channels can be bound
   to the same protocol, but a channel cannot be bound to multiple protocols.
   Each L2CAP packet received on a channel is directed to the appropriate
   higher level protocol. Multiple channels can share the same baseband
   connection.

   A single Netgraph node of type l2cap is created for a single Bluetooth
   device. The L2CAP node is normally connected to the Bluetooth HCI node
   (downstream) and Bluetooth sockets nodes (upstream). Default name for the
   L2CAP node is ``devicel2cap''. For more details refer to the ng_l2cap(4)
   man page.

   A useful command is l2ping(8), which can be used to ping other devices.
   Some Bluetooth implementations might not return all of the data sent to
   them, so 0 bytes in the following example is normal.

 # l2ping -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4
 0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=0 time=48.633 ms result=0
 0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=1 time=37.551 ms result=0
 0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=2 time=28.324 ms result=0
 0 bytes from 0:80:37:29:19:a4 seq_no=3 time=46.150 ms result=0

   The l2control(8) utility is used to perform various operations on L2CAP
   nodes. This example shows how to obtain the list of logical connections
   (channels) and the list of baseband connections for the local device.

 % l2control -a 00:02:72:00:d4:1a read_channel_list
 L2CAP channels:
 Remote BD_ADDR     SCID/ DCID   PSM  IMTU/ OMTU State
 00:07:e0:00:0b:ca    66/   64     3   132/  672 OPEN
 % l2control -a 00:02:72:00:d4:1a read_connection_list
 L2CAP connections:
 Remote BD_ADDR    Handle Flags Pending State
 00:07:e0:00:0b:ca     41 O           0 OPEN

   Another diagnostic tool is btsockstat(1). It does a job similar to as
   netstat(1) does, but for Bluetooth network-related data structures. The
   example below shows the same logical connection as l2control(8) above.

 % btsockstat

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.5 RFCOMM Protocol

   The RFCOMM protocol provides emulation of serial ports over the L2CAP
   protocol. The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10. RFCOMM is a
   simple transport protocol, with additional provisions for emulating the 9
   circuits of RS-232 (EIATIA-232-E) serial ports. The RFCOMM protocol
   supports up to 60 simultaneous connections (RFCOMM channels) between two
   Bluetooth devices.

   For the purposes of RFCOMM, a complete communication path involves two
   applications running on different devices (the communication endpoints)
   with a communication segment between them. RFCOMM is intended to cover
   applications that make use of the serial ports of the devices in which
   they reside. The communication segment is a Bluetooth link from one device
   to another (direct connect).

   RFCOMM is only concerned with the connection between the devices in the
   direct connect case, or between the device and a modem in the network
   case. RFCOMM can support other configurations, such as modules that
   communicate via Bluetooth wireless technology on one side and provide a
   wired interface on the other side.

   In DragonFly the RFCOMM protocol is implemented at the Bluetooth sockets
   layer.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.6 Pairing of Devices

   By default, Bluetooth communication is not authenticated, and any device
   can talk to any other device. A Bluetooth device (for example, cellular
   phone) may choose to require authentication to provide a particular
   service (for example, Dial-Up service). Bluetooth authentication is
   normally done with PIN codes. A PIN code is an ASCII string up to 16
   characters in length. User is required to enter the same PIN code on both
   devices. Once user has entered the PIN code, both devices will generate a
   link key. After that the link key can be stored either in the devices
   themselves or in a persistent storage. Next time both devices will use
   previously generated link key. The described above procedure is called
   pairing. Note that if the link key is lost by any device then pairing must
   be repeated.

   The hcsecd(8) daemon is responsible for handling of all Bluetooth
   authentication requests. The default configuration file is
   /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf. An example section for a cellular phone with
   the PIN code arbitrarily set to ``1234'' is shown below.

 device {
         bdaddr  00:80:37:29:19:a4;
         name    "Pav's T39";
         key     nokey;
         pin     "1234";
       }

   There is no limitation on PIN codes (except length). Some devices (for
   example Bluetooth headsets) may have a fixed PIN code built in. The -d
   switch forces the hcsecd(8) daemon to stay in the foreground, so it is
   easy to see what is happening. Set the remote device to receive pairing
   and initiate the Bluetooth connection to the remote device. The remote
   device should say that pairing was accepted, and request the PIN code.
   Enter the same PIN code as you have in hcsecd.conf. Now your PC and the
   remote device are paired. Alternatively, you can initiate pairing on the
   remote device. Below in the sample hcsecd output.

 hcsecd[16484]: Got Link_Key_Request event from 'ubt0hci', remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4
 hcsecd[16484]: Found matching entry, remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4, name 'Pav's T39', link key doesn't exist
 hcsecd[16484]: Sending Link_Key_Negative_Reply to 'ubt0hci' for remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4
 hcsecd[16484]: Got PIN_Code_Request event from 'ubt0hci', remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4
 hcsecd[16484]: Found matching entry, remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4, name 'Pav's T39', PIN code exists
 hcsecd[16484]: Sending PIN_Code_Reply to 'ubt0hci' for remote bdaddr 0:80:37:29:19:a4

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.7 Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)

   The Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) provides the means for client
   applications to discover the existence of services provided by server
   applications as well as the attributes of those services. The attributes
   of a service include the type or class of service offered and the
   mechanism or protocol information needed to utilize the service.

   SDP involves communication between a SDP server and a SDP client. The
   server maintains a list of service records that describe the
   characteristics of services associated with the server. Each service
   record contains information about a single service. A client may retrieve
   information from a service record maintained by the SDP server by issuing
   a SDP request. If the client, or an application associated with the
   client, decides to use a service, it must open a separate connection to
   the service provider in order to utilize the service. SDP provides a
   mechanism for discovering services and their attributes, but it does not
   provide a mechanism for utilizing those services.

   Normally, a SDP client searches for services based on some desired
   characteristics of the services. However, there are times when it is
   desirable to discover which types of services are described by an SDP
   server's service records without any a priori information about the
   services. This process of looking for any offered services is called
   browsing.

   The Bluetooth SDP server sdpd(8) and command line client sdpcontrol(8) are
   included in the standard DragonFly installation. The following example
   shows how to perform a SDP browse query.

 % sdpcontrol -a 00:01:03:fc:6e:ec browse
 Record Handle: 00000000
 Service Class ID List:
         Service Discovery Server (0x1000)
 Protocol Descriptor List:
         L2CAP (0x0100)
                 Protocol specific parameter #1: u/int/uuid16 1
                 Protocol specific parameter #2: u/int/uuid16 1

 Record Handle: 0x00000001
 Service Class ID List:
         Browse Group Descriptor (0x1001)

 Record Handle: 0x00000002
 Service Class ID List:
         LAN Access Using PPP (0x1102)
 Protocol Descriptor List:
         L2CAP (0x0100)
         RFCOMM (0x0003)
                 Protocol specific parameter #1: u/int8/bool 1
 Bluetooth Profile Descriptor List:
         LAN Access Using PPP (0x1102) ver. 1.0

   ... and so on. Note that each service has a list of attributes (RFCOMM
   channel for example). Depending on the service you might need to make a
   note of some of the attributes. Some Bluetooth implementations do not
   support service browsing and may return an empty list. In this case it is
   possible to search for the specific service. The example below shows how
   to search for the OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) service.

 % sdpcontrol -a 00:01:03:fc:6e:ec search OPUSH

   Offering services on DragonFly to Bluetooth clients is done with the
   sdpd(8) server.

 # sdpd

   The local server application that wants to provide Bluetooth service to
   the remote clients will register service with the local SDP daemon. The
   example of such application is rfcomm_pppd(8). Once started it will
   register Bluetooth LAN service with the local SDP daemon.

   The list of services registered with the local SDP server can be obtained
   by issuing SDP browse query via local control channel.

 # sdpcontrol -l browse

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.8 Dial-Up Networking (DUN) and Network Access with PPP (LAN) Profiles

   The Dial-Up Networking (DUN) profile is mostly used with modems and
   cellular phones. The scenarios covered by this profile are the following:

     * use of a cellular phone or modem by a computer as a wireless modem for
       connecting to a dial-up internet access server, or using other dial-up
       services;

     * use of a cellular phone or modem by a computer to receive data calls.

   Network Access with PPP (LAN) profile can be used in the following
   situations:

     * LAN access for a single Bluetooth device;

     * LAN access for multiple Bluetooth devices;

     * PC to PC (using PPP networking over serial cable emulation).

   In DragonFly both profiles are implemented with ppp(8) and rfcomm_pppd(8)
   - a wrapper that converts RFCOMM Bluetooth connection into something PPP
   can operate with. Before any profile can be used, a new PPP label in the
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf must be created. Consult rfcomm_pppd(8) manual page for
   examples.

   In the following example rfcomm_pppd(8) will be used to open RFCOMM
   connection to remote device with BD_ADDR 00:80:37:29:19:a4 on DUN RFCOMM
   channel. The actual RFCOMM channel number will be obtained from the remote
   device via SDP. It is possible to specify RFCOMM channel by hand, and in
   this case rfcomm_pppd(8) will not perform SDP query. Use sdpcontrol(8) to
   find out RFCOMM channel on the remote device.

 # rfcomm_pppd -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4 -c -C dun -l rfcomm-dialup

   In order to provide Network Access with PPP (LAN) service the sdpd(8)
   server must be running. A new entry for LAN clients must be created in the
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf file. Consult rfcomm_pppd(8) manual page for examples.
   Finally, start RFCOMM PPP server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The
   RFCOMM PPP server will automatically register Bluetooth LAN service with
   the local SDP daemon. The example below shows how to start RFCOMM PPP
   server.

 # rfcomm_pppd -s -C 7 -l rfcomm-server

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.9 OBEX Object Push (OPUSH) Profile

   OBEX is a widely used protocol for simple file transfers between mobile
   devices. Its main use is in infrared communication, where it is used for
   generic file transfers between notebooks or Palm handhelds, and for
   sending business cards or calendar entries between cellular phones and
   other devices with PIM applications.

   The OBEX server and client are implemented as a third-party package
   obexapp, which is available as comms/obexapp port.

   OBEX client is used to push and/or pull objects from the OBEX server. An
   object can, for example, be a business card or an appointment. The OBEX
   client can obtain RFCOMM channel number from the remote device via SDP.
   This can be done by specifying service name instead of RFCOMM channel
   number. Supported service names are: IrMC, FTRN and OPUSH. It is possible
   to specify RFCOMM channel as a number. Below is an example of an OBEX
   session, where device information object is pulled from the cellular
   phone, and a new object (business card) is pushed into the phone's
   directory.

 % obexapp -a 00:80:37:29:19:a4 -C IrMC
 obex> get
 get: remote file> telecom/devinfo.txt
 get: local file> devinfo-t39.txt
 Success, response: OK, Success (0x20)
 obex> put
 put: local file> new.vcf
 put: remote file> new.vcf
 Success, response: OK, Success (0x20)
 obex> di
 Success, response: OK, Success (0x20)

   In order to provide OBEX Object Push service, sdpd(8) server must be
   running. A root folder, where all incoming objects will be stored, must be
   created. The default path to the root folder is /var/spool/obex. Finally,
   start OBEX server on valid RFCOMM channel number. The OBEX server will
   automatically register OBEX Object Push service with the local SDP daemon.
   The example below shows how to start OBEX server.

 # obexapp -s -C 10

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.10 Serial Port (SP) Profile

   The Serial Port (SP) profile allows Bluetooth device to perform RS232 (or
   similar) serial cable emulation. The scenario covered by this profile
   deals with legacy applications using Bluetooth as a cable replacement,
   through a virtual serial port abstraction.

   The rfcomm_sppd(1) utility implements the Serial Port profile. Pseudo tty
   is used as a virtual serial port abstraction. The example below shows how
   to connect to a remote device Serial Port service. Note that you do not
   have to specify RFCOMM channel - rfcomm_sppd(1) can obtain it from the
   remote device via SDP. If you would like to override this, specify RFCOMM
   channel in the command line.

 # rfcomm_sppd -a 00:07:E0:00:0B:CA -t /dev/ttyp6
 rfcomm_sppd[94692]: Starting on /dev/ttyp6...

   Once connected pseudo tty can be used as serial port.

 # cu -l ttyp6

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.4.11 Troubleshooting

    19.4.11.1 A remote device cannot connect

   Some older Bluetooth devices do not support role switching. By default,
   when DragonFly is accepting a new connection, it tries to perform role
   switch and become a master. Devices, which do not support this will not be
   able to connect. Note the role switching is performed when a new
   connection is being established, so it is not possible to ask the remote
   device if it does support role switching. There is a HCI option to disable
   role switching on the local side.

 # hccontrol -n ubt0hci write_node_role_switch 0

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.4.11.2 Something is going wrong, can I see what exactly is happening?

   Yes, you can. Use the hcidump-1.5 third-party package that can be
   downloaded from here. The hcidump utility is similar to tcpdump(1). It can
   be used to display the content of the Bluetooth packets on the terminal
   and to dump the Bluetooth packets to a file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.5 Bridging

   Written by Steve Peterson.

  19.5.1 Introduction

   It is sometimes useful to divide one physical network (such as an Ethernet
   segment) into two separate network segments without having to create IP
   subnets and use a router to connect the segments together. A device that
   connects two networks together in this fashion is called a ``bridge''. A
   DragonFly system with two network interface cards can act as a bridge.

   The bridge works by learning the MAC layer addresses (Ethernet addresses)
   of the devices on each of its network interfaces. It forwards traffic
   between two networks only when its source and destination are on different
   networks.

   In many respects, a bridge is like an Ethernet switch with very few ports.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.5.2 Situations Where Bridging Is Appropriate

   There are two common situations in which a bridge is used today.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.5.2.1 High Traffic on a Segment

   Situation one is where your physical network segment is overloaded with
   traffic, but you do not want for whatever reason to subnet the network and
   interconnect the subnets with a router.

   Let us consider an example of a newspaper where the Editorial and
   Production departments are on the same subnetwork. The Editorial users all
   use server A for file service, and the Production users are on server B.
   An Ethernet network is used to connect all users together, and high loads
   on the network are slowing things down.

   If the Editorial users could be segregated on one network segment and the
   Production users on another, the two network segments could be connected
   with a bridge. Only the network traffic destined for interfaces on the
   ``other'' side of the bridge would be sent to the other network, reducing
   congestion on each network segment.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.5.2.2 Filtering/Traffic Shaping Firewall

   The second common situation is where firewall functionality is needed
   without network address translation (NAT).

   An example is a small company that is connected via DSL or ISDN to their
   ISP. They have a 13 globally-accessible IP addresses from their ISP and
   have 10 PCs on their network. In this situation, using a router-based
   firewall is difficult because of subnetting issues.

   A bridge-based firewall can be configured and dropped into the path just
   downstream of their DSL/ISDN router without any IP numbering issues.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.5.3 Configuring a Bridge

    19.5.3.1 Network Interface Card Selection

   A bridge requires at least two network cards to function. Unfortunately,
   not all network interface cards support bridging. Read bridge(4) for
   details on the cards that are supported.

   Install and test the two network cards before continuing.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.5.3.2 Kernel Configuration Changes

   To enable kernel support for bridging, add the:

 options BRIDGE

   statement to your kernel configuration file, and rebuild your kernel.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.5.3.3 Firewall Support

   If you are planning to use the bridge as a firewall, you will need to add
   the IPFIREWALL option as well. Read Section 10.7 for general information
   on configuring the bridge as a firewall.

   If you need to allow non-IP packets (such as ARP) to flow through the
   bridge, there is a firewall option that must be set. This option is
   IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT. Note that this changes the default rule for
   the firewall to accept any packet. Make sure you know how this changes the
   meaning of your ruleset before you set it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.5.3.4 Traffic Shaping Support

   If you want to use the bridge as a traffic shaper, you will need to add
   the DUMMYNET option to your kernel configuration. Read dummynet(4) for
   further information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.5.4 Enabling the Bridge

   Add the line:

 net.link.ether.bridge=1

   to /etc/sysctl.conf to enable the bridge at runtime, and the line:

 net.link.ether.bridge_cfg=if1,if2

   to enable bridging on the specified interfaces (replace if1 and if2 with
   the names of your two network interfaces). If you want the bridged packets
   to be filtered by ipfw(8), you should add:

 net.link.ether.bridge_ipfw=1

   as well.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.5.5 Other Information

   If you want to be able to telnet(1) into the bridge from the network, it
   is correct to assign one of the network cards an IP address. The consensus
   is that assigning both cards an address is a bad idea.

   If you have multiple bridges on your network, there cannot be more than
   one path between any two workstations. Technically, this means that there
   is no support for spanning tree link management.

   A bridge can add latency to your ping(8) times, especially for traffic
   from one segment to another.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.6 NFS

   Reorganized and enhanced by Tom Rhodes. Written by Bill Swingle.

   Among the many different filesystems that DragonFly supports is the
   Network File System, also known as NFS. NFS allows a system to share
   directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and
   programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local
   files.

   Some of the most notable benefits that NFS can provide are:

     * Local workstations use less disk space because commonly used data can
       be stored on a single machine and still remain accessible to others
       over the network.

     * There is no need for users to have separate home directories on every
       network machine. Home directories could be set up on the NFS server
       and made available throughout the network.

     * Storage devices such as floppy disks, CDROM drives, and ZIP drives can
       be used by other machines on the network. This may reduce the number
       of removable media drives throughout the network.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.6.1 How NFS Works

   NFS consists of at least two main parts: a server and one or more clients.
   The client remotely accesses the data that is stored on the server
   machine. In order for this to function properly a few processes have to be
   configured and running:

   The server has to be running the following daemons:

   Daemon                             Description                             
   nfsd    The NFS daemon which services requests from the NFS clients.       
   mountd  The NFS mount daemon which carries out the requests that nfsd(8)   
           passes on to it.                                                   
   portmap The portmapper daemon allows NFS clients to discover which port    
           the NFS server is using.                                           

   The client can also run a daemon, known as nfsiod. The nfsiod daemon
   services the requests from the NFS server. This is optional, and improves
   performance, but is not required for normal and correct operation. See the
   nfsiod(8) manual page for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.6.2 Configuring NFS

   NFS configuration is a relatively straightforward process. The processes
   that need to be running can all start at boot time with a few
   modifications to your /etc/rc.conf file.

   On the NFS server, make sure that the following options are configured in
   the /etc/rc.conf file:

 portmap_enable="YES"
 nfs_server_enable="YES"
 mountd_flags="-r"

   mountd runs automatically whenever the NFS server is enabled.

   On the client, make sure this option is present in /etc/rc.conf:

 nfs_client_enable="YES"

   The /etc/exports file specifies which filesystems NFS should export
   (sometimes referred to as ``share''). Each line in /etc/exports specifies
   a filesystem to be exported and which machines have access to that
   filesystem. Along with what machines have access to that filesystem,
   access options may also be specified. There are many such options that can
   be used in this file but only a few will be mentioned here. You can easily
   discover other options by reading over the exports(5) manual page.

   Here are a few example /etc/exports entries:

   The following examples give an idea of how to export filesystems, although
   the settings may be different depending on your environment and network
   configuration. For instance, to export the /cdrom directory to three
   example machines that have the same domain name as the server (hence the
   lack of a domain name for each) or have entries in your /etc/hosts file.
   The -ro flag makes the exported filesystem read-only. With this flag, the
   remote system will not be able to write any changes to the exported
   filesystem.

 /cdrom -ro host1 host2 host3

   The following line exports /home to three hosts by IP address. This is a
   useful setup if you have a private network without a DNS server
   configured. Optionally the /etc/hosts file could be configured for
   internal hostnames; please review hosts(5) for more information. The
   -alldirs flag allows the subdirectories to be mount points. In other
   words, it will not mount the subdirectories but permit the client to mount
   only the directories that are required or needed.

 /home  -alldirs  10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.4

   The following line exports /a so that two clients from different domains
   may access the filesystem. The -maproot=root flag allows the root user on
   the remote system to write data on the exported filesystem as root. If the
   -maproot=root flag is not specified, then even if a user has root access
   on the remote system, they will not be able to modify files on the
   exported filesystem.

 /a  -maproot=root  host.example.com box.example.org

   In order for a client to access an exported filesystem, the client must
   have permission to do so. Make sure the client is listed in your
   /etc/exports file.

   In /etc/exports, each line represents the export information for one
   filesystem to one host. A remote host can only be specified once per
   filesystem, and may only have one default entry. For example, assume that
   /usr is a single filesystem. The following /etc/exports would be invalid:

 /usr/src   client
 /usr/ports client

   One filesystem, /usr, has two lines specifying exports to the same host,
   client. The correct format for this situation is:

 /usr/src /usr/ports  client

   The properties of one filesystem exported to a given host must all occur
   on one line. Lines without a client specified are treated as a single
   host. This limits how you can export filesystems, but for most people this
   is not an issue.

   The following is an example of a valid export list, where /usr and
   /exports are local filesystems:

 # Export src and ports to client01 and client02, but only
 # client01 has root privileges on it
 /usr/src /usr/ports -maproot=root    client01
 /usr/src /usr/ports               client02
 # The client machines have root and can mount anywhere
 # on /exports. Anyone in the world can mount /exports/obj read-only
 /exports -alldirs -maproot=root      client01 client02
 /exports/obj -ro

   You must restart mountd whenever you modify /etc/exports so the changes
   can take effect. This can be accomplished by sending the HUP signal to the
   mountd process:

 # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`

   Alternatively, a reboot will make DragonFly set everything up properly. A
   reboot is not necessary though. Executing the following commands as root
   should start everything up.

   On the NFS server:

 # portmap
 # nfsd -u -t -n 4
 # mountd -r

   On the NFS client:

 # nfsiod -n 4

   Now everything should be ready to actually mount a remote file system. In
   these examples the server's name will be server and the client's name will
   be client. If you only want to temporarily mount a remote filesystem or
   would rather test the configuration, just execute a command like this as
   root on the client:

 # mount server:/home /mnt

   This will mount the /home directory on the server at /mnt on the client.
   If everything is set up correctly you should be able to enter /mnt on the
   client and see all the files that are on the server.

   If you want to automatically mount a remote filesystem each time the
   computer boots, add the filesystem to the /etc/fstab file. Here is an
   example:

 server:/home    /mnt    nfs     rw      0       0

   The fstab(5) manual page lists all the available options.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.6.3 Practical Uses

   NFS has many practical uses. Some of the more common ones are listed
   below:

     * Set several machines to share a CDROM or other media among them. This
       is cheaper and often a more convenient method to install software on
       multiple machines.

     * On large networks, it might be more convenient to configure a central
       NFS server in which to store all the user home directories. These home
       directories can then be exported to the network so that users would
       always have the same home directory, regardless of which workstation
       they log in to.

     * Several machines could have a common /usr/ports/distfiles directory.
       That way, when you need to install a port on several machines, you can
       quickly access the source without downloading it on each machine.

  19.6.4 Automatic Mounts with amd

   Contributed by Wylie Stilwell. Rewritten by Chern Lee.

   amd(8) (the automatic mounter daemon) automatically mounts a remote
   filesystem whenever a file or directory within that filesystem is
   accessed. Filesystems that are inactive for a period of time will also be
   automatically unmounted by amd. Using amd provides a simple alternative to
   permanent mounts, as permanent mounts are usually listed in /etc/fstab.

   amd operates by attaching itself as an NFS server to the /host and /net
   directories. When a file is accessed within one of these directories, amd
   looks up the corresponding remote mount and automatically mounts it. /net
   is used to mount an exported filesystem from an IP address, while /host is
   used to mount an export from a remote hostname.

   An access to a file within /host/foobar/usr would tell amd to attempt to
   mount the /usr export on the host foobar.

   Example 19-1. Mounting an Export with amd

   You can view the available mounts of a remote host with the showmount
   command. For example, to view the mounts of a host named foobar, you can
   use:

 % showmount -e foobar
 Exports list on foobar:
 /usr                               10.10.10.0
 /a                                 10.10.10.0
 % cd /host/foobar/usr

   As seen in the example, the showmount shows /usr as an export. When
   changing directories to /host/foobar/usr, amd attempts to resolve the
   hostname foobar and automatically mount the desired export.

   amd can be started by the startup scripts by placing the following lines
   in /etc/rc.conf:

 amd_enable="YES"

   Additionally, custom flags can be passed to amd from the amd_flags option.
   By default, amd_flags is set to:

 amd_flags="-a /.amd_mnt -l syslog /host /etc/amd.map /net /etc/amd.map"

   The /etc/amd.map file defines the default options that exports are mounted
   with. The /etc/amd.conf file defines some of the more advanced features of
   amd.

   Consult the amd(8) and amd.conf(5) manual pages for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.6.5 Problems Integrating with Other Systems

   Contributed by John Lind.

   Certain Ethernet adapters for ISA PC systems have limitations which can
   lead to serious network problems, particularly with NFS. This difficulty
   is not specific to DragonFly, but DragonFly systems are affected by it.

   The problem nearly always occurs when (DragonFly) PC systems are networked
   with high-performance workstations, such as those made by Silicon
   Graphics, Inc., and Sun Microsystems, Inc. The NFS mount will work fine,
   and some operations may succeed, but suddenly the server will seem to
   become unresponsive to the client, even though requests to and from other
   systems continue to be processed. This happens to the client system,
   whether the client is the DragonFly system or the workstation. On many
   systems, there is no way to shut down the client gracefully once this
   problem has manifested itself. The only solution is often to reset the
   client, because the NFS situation cannot be resolved.

   Though the ``correct'' solution is to get a higher performance and
   capacity Ethernet adapter for the DragonFly system, there is a simple
   workaround that will allow satisfactory operation. If the DragonFly system
   is the server, include the option -w=1024 on the mount from the client. If
   the DragonFly system is the client, then mount the NFS filesystem with the
   option -r=1024. These options may be specified using the fourth field of
   the fstab entry on the client for automatic mounts, or by using the -o
   parameter of the mount(8) command for manual mounts.

   It should be noted that there is a different problem, sometimes mistaken
   for this one, when the NFS servers and clients are on different networks.
   If that is the case, make certain that your routers are routing the
   necessary UDP information, or you will not get anywhere, no matter what
   else you are doing.

   In the following examples, fastws is the host (interface) name of a
   high-performance workstation, and freebox is the host (interface) name of
   a DragonFly system with a lower-performance Ethernet adapter. Also,
   /sharedfs will be the exported NFS filesystem (see exports(5)), and
   /project will be the mount point on the client for the exported
   filesystem. In all cases, note that additional options, such as hard or
   soft and bg may be desirable in your application.

   Examples for the DragonFly system (freebox) as the client in /etc/fstab on
   freebox:

 fastws:/sharedfs /project nfs rw,-r=1024 0 0

   As a manual mount command on freebox:

 # mount -t nfs -o -r=1024 fastws:/sharedfs /project

   Examples for the DragonFly system as the server in /etc/fstab on fastws:

 freebox:/sharedfs /project nfs rw,-w=1024 0 0

   As a manual mount command on fastws:

 # mount -t nfs -o -w=1024 freebox:/sharedfs /project

   Nearly any 16-bit Ethernet adapter will allow operation without the above
   restrictions on the read or write size.

   For anyone who cares, here is what happens when the failure occurs, which
   also explains why it is unrecoverable. NFS typically works with a
   ``block'' size of 8 k (though it may do fragments of smaller sizes). Since
   the maximum Ethernet packet is around 1500 bytes, the NFS ``block'' gets
   split into multiple Ethernet packets, even though it is still a single
   unit to the upper-level code, and must be received, assembled, and
   acknowledged as a unit. The high-performance workstations can pump out the
   packets which comprise the NFS unit one right after the other, just as
   close together as the standard allows. On the smaller, lower capacity
   cards, the later packets overrun the earlier packets of the same unit
   before they can be transferred to the host and the unit as a whole cannot
   be reconstructed or acknowledged. As a result, the workstation will time
   out and try again, but it will try again with the entire 8 K unit, and the
   process will be repeated, ad infinitum.

   By keeping the unit size below the Ethernet packet size limitation, we
   ensure that any complete Ethernet packet received can be acknowledged
   individually, avoiding the deadlock situation.

   Overruns may still occur when a high-performance workstations is slamming
   data out to a PC system, but with the better cards, such overruns are not
   guaranteed on NFS ``units''. When an overrun occurs, the units affected
   will be retransmitted, and there will be a fair chance that they will be
   received, assembled, and acknowledged.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.7 Diskless Operation

   Updated by Jean-Franc,ois Dockes. Reorganized and enhanced by Alex Dupre.

   A DragonFly machine can boot over the network and operate without a local
   disk, using filesystems mounted from an NFS server. No system modification
   is necessary, beyond standard configuration files. Such a system is
   relatively easy to set up because all the necessary elements are readily
   available:

     * There are at least two possible methods to load the kernel over the
       network:

          * PXE: The Intel Preboot Execution Environment system is a form of
            smart boot ROM built into some networking cards or motherboards.
            See pxeboot(8) for more details.

          * The etherboot port (net/etherboot) produces ROM-able code to boot
            kernels over the network. The code can be either burnt into a
            boot PROM on a network card, or loaded from a local floppy (or
            hard) disk drive, or from a running MS-DOS system. Many network
            cards are supported.

     * A sample script (/usr/share/examples/diskless/clone_root) eases the
       creation and maintenance of the workstation's root filesystem on the
       server. The script will probably require a little customization but it
       will get you started very quickly.

     * Standard system startup files exist in /etc to detect and support a
       diskless system startup.

     * Swapping, if needed, can be done either to an NFS file or to a local
       disk.

   There are many ways to set up diskless workstations. Many elements are
   involved, and most can be customized to suit local taste. The following
   will describe variations on the setup of a complete system, emphasizing
   simplicity and compatibility with the standard DragonFly startup scripts.
   The system described has the following characteristics:

     * The diskless workstations use a shared read-only root filesystem, and
       a shared read-only /usr.

       The root filesystem is a copy of a standard DragonFly root (typically
       the server's), with some configuration files overridden by ones
       specific to diskless operation or, possibly, to the workstation they
       belong to.

       The parts of the root which have to be writable are overlaid with
       mfs(8) filesystems. Any changes will be lost when the system reboots.

     * The kernel is transferred and loaded either with etherboot or PXE as
       some situations may mandate the use of either method.

     Caution: As described, this system is insecure. It should live in a
     protected area of a network, and be untrusted by other hosts.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.7.1 Background Information

   Setting up diskless workstations is both relatively straightforward and
   prone to errors. These are sometimes difficult to diagnose for a number of
   reasons. For example:

     * Compile time options may determine different behaviours at runtime.

     * Error messages are often cryptic or totally absent.

   In this context, having some knowledge of the background mechanisms
   involved is very useful to solve the problems that may arise.

   Several operations need to be performed for a successful bootstrap:

     * The machine needs to obtain initial parameters such as its IP address,
       executable filename, server name, root path. This is done using the
       DHCP or BOOTP protocols. DHCP is a compatible extension of BOOTP, and
       uses the same port numbers and basic packet format.

       It is possible to configure a system to use only BOOTP. The bootpd(8)
       server program is included in the base DragonFly system.

       However, DHCP has a number of advantages over BOOTP (nicer
       configuration files, possibility of using PXE, plus many others not
       directly related to diskless operation), and we will describe mainly a
       DHCP configuration, with equivalent exemples using bootpd(8) when
       possible. The sample configuration will use the ISC DHCP software
       package (release 3.0.1.r12 was installed on the test server).

     * The machine needs to transfer one or several programs to local memory.
       Either TFTP or NFS are used. The choice between TFTP and NFS is a
       compile time option in several places. A common source of error is to
       specify filenames for the wrong protocol: TFTP typically transfers all
       files from a single directory on the server, and would expect
       filenames relative to this directory. NFS needs absolute file paths.

     * The possible intermediate bootstrap programs and the kernel need to be
       initialized and executed. There are several important variations in
       this area:

          * PXE will load pxeboot(8), which is a modified version of the
            DragonFly third stage loader. The loader(8) will obtain most
            parameters necessary to system startup, and leave them in the
            kernel environment before transferring control. It is possible to
            use a GENERIC kernel in this case.

          * etherboot, will directly load the kernel, with less preparation.
            You will need to build a kernel with specific options.

     * Finally, the machine needs to access its filesystems. NFS is used in
       all cases.

   See also diskless(8) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.7.2 Setup Instructions

    19.7.2.1 Configuration Using ISC DHCP

   The ISC DHCP server can answer both BOOTP and DHCP requests.

   ISC DHCP needs a configuration file to run, (normally named
   /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf). Here follows a commented example, where host
   margaux uses etherboot and host corbieres uses PXE:

 default-lease-time 600;
 max-lease-time 7200;
 authoritative;

 option domain-name "example.com";
 option domain-name-servers 192.168.4.1;
 option routers 192.168.4.1;

 subnet 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   use-host-decl-names on; (1)
   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
   option broadcast-address 192.168.4.255;

   host margaux {
     hardware ethernet 01:23:45:67:89:ab;
     fixed-address margaux.example.com;
     next-server 192.168.4.4; (2)
     filename "/data/misc/kernel.diskless"; (3)
     option root-path "192.168.4.4:/data/misc/diskless"; (4)
   }
   host corbieres {
     hardware ethernet 00:02:b3:27:62:df;
     fixed-address corbieres.example.com;
     next-server 192.168.4.4;
     filename "pxeboot";
     option root-path "192.168.4.4:/data/misc/diskless";
   }
 }
          

   (1)
           This option tells dhcpd to send the value in the host declarations
           as the hostname for the diskless host. An alternate way would be
           to add an option host-name margaux inside the host declarations.
   (2)
           The next-server directive designates the TFTP or NFS server to use
           for loading loader or kernel file (the default is to use the same
           host as the DHCP server).
   (3)
           The filename directive defines the file that etherboot or PXE will
           load for the next execution step. It must be specified according
           to the transfer method used. etherboot can be compiled to use NFS
           or TFTP. The DragonFly port configures NFS by default. PXE uses
           TFTP, which is why a relative filename is used here (this may
           depend on the TFTP server configuration, but would be fairly
           typical). Also, PXE loads pxeboot, not the kernel. There are other
           interesting possibilities, like loading pxeboot from a DragonFly
           CD-ROM /boot directory (as pxeboot(8) can load a GENERIC kernel,
           this makes it possible to use PXE to boot from a remote CD-ROM).
   (4)
           The root-path option defines the path to the root filesystem, in
           usual NFS notation. When using PXE, it is possible to leave off
           the host's IP as long as you do not enable the kernel option
           BOOTP. The NFS server will then be the same as the TFTP one.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.2 Configuration Using BOOTP

   Here follows an equivalent bootpd configuration (reduced to one client).
   This would be found in /etc/bootptab.

   Please note that etherboot must be compiled with the non-default option
   NO_DHCP_SUPPORT in order to use BOOTP, and that PXE needs DHCP. The only
   obvious advantage of bootpd is that it exists in the base system.

 .def100:\
   :hn:ht=1:sa=192.168.4.4:vm=rfc1048:\
   :sm=255.255.255.0:\
   :ds=192.168.4.1:\
   :gw=192.168.4.1:\
   :hd="/tftpboot":\
   :bf="/kernel.diskless":\
   :rp="192.168.4.4:/data/misc/diskless":

 margaux:ha=0123456789ab:tc=.def100
          

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.3 Booting with PXE

   By default, the pxeboot(8) loader loads the kernel via NFS. It can be
   compiled to use TFTP instead by specifying the LOADER_TFTP_SUPPORT option
   in /etc/make.conf. See the comments in /etc/defaults/make.conf (or
   /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf for 5.X systems) for instructions.

   There are two other undocumented make.conf options which may be useful for
   setting up a serial console diskless machine: BOOT_PXELDR_PROBE_KEYBOARD,
   and BOOT_PXELDR_ALWAYS_SERIAL.

   To use PXE when the machine starts, you will usually need to select the
   Boot from network option in your BIOS setup, or type a function key during
   the PC initialization.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.4 Configuring the TFTP and NFS Servers

   If you are using PXE or etherboot configured to use TFTP, you need to
   enable tftpd on the file server:

    1. Create a directory from which tftpd will serve the files, e.g.
       /tftpboot.

    2. Add this line to your /etc/inetd.conf:

 tftp    dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/libexec/tftpd      tftpd -l -s /tftpboot

         Note: It appears that at least some PXE versions want the TCP
         version of TFTP. In this case, add a second line, replacing dgram
         udp with stream tcp.

    3. Tell inetd to reread its configuration file:

 # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

   You can place the tftpboot directory anywhere on the server. Make sure
   that the location is set in both inetd.conf and dhcpd.conf.

   In all cases, you also need to enable NFS and export the appropriate
   filesystem on the NFS server.

    1. Add this to /etc/rc.conf:

 nfs_server_enable="YES"

    2. Export the filesystem where the diskless root directory is located by
       adding the following to /etc/exports (adjust the volume mount point
       and replace margaux corbieres with the names of the diskless
       workstations):

 /data/misc -alldirs -ro margaux corbieres

    3. Tell mountd to reread its configuration file. If you actually needed
       to enable NFS in /etc/rc.conf at the first step, you probably want to
       reboot instead.

 # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.5 Building a Diskless Kernel

   If using etherboot, you need to create a kernel configuration file for the
   diskless client with the following options (in addition to the usual
   ones):

 options     BOOTP          # Use BOOTP to obtain IP address/hostname
 options     BOOTP_NFSROOT  # NFS mount root filesystem using BOOTP info
        

   You may also want to use BOOTP_NFSV3, BOOT_COMPAT and BOOTP_WIRED_TO
   (refer to LINT.

   These option names are historical and slightly misleading as they actually
   enable indifferent use of DHCP and BOOTP inside the kernel (it is also
   possible to force strict BOOTP or DHCP use).

   Build the kernel (see Chapter 9), and copy it to the place specified in
   dhcpd.conf.

     Note: When using PXE, building a kernel with the above options is not
     strictly necessary (though suggested). Enabling them will cause more
     DHCP requests to be issued during kernel startup, with a small risk of
     inconsistency between the new values and those retrieved by pxeboot(8)
     in some special cases. The advantage of using them is that the host name
     will be set as a side effect. Otherwise you will need to set the host
     name by another method, for example in a client-specific rc.conf file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.6 Preparing the Root Filesystem

   You need to create a root filesystem for the diskless workstations, in the
   location listed as root-path in dhcpd.conf. The following sections
   describe two ways to do it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.7.2.6.1 Using the clone_root Script

   This is the quickest way to create a root filesystem. but This shell
   script is located at /usr/share/examples/diskless/clone_root and needs
   customization, at least to adjust the place where the filesystem will be
   created (the DEST variable).

   Refer to the comments at the top of the script for instructions. They
   explain how the base filesystem is built, and how files may be selectively
   overridden by versions specific to diskless operation, to a subnetwork, or
   to an individual workstation. They also give examples for the diskless
   /etc/fstab and /etc/rc.conf files.

   The README files in /usr/share/examples/diskless contain a lot of
   interesting background information, but, together with the other examples
   in the diskless directory, they actually document a configuration method
   which is distinct from the one used by clone_root and the system startup
   scripts in /etc, which is a little confusing. Use them for reference only,
   except if you prefer the method that they describe, in which case you will
   need customized rc scripts.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.7.2.6.2 Using the Standard make world Procedure

   This method will install a complete virgin system (not only the root
   filesystem) into DESTDIR. All you have to do is simply execute the
   following script:

 #!/bin/sh
 export DESTDIR=/data/misc/diskless
 mkdir -p ${DESTDIR}
 cd /usr/src; make world && make kernel
 cd /usr/src/etc; make distribution

   Once done, you may need to customize your /etc/rc.conf and /etc/fstab
   placed into DESTDIR according to your needs.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.7 Configuring Swap

   If needed, a swap file located on the server can be accessed via NFS.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.7.2.7.1 NFS Swap with DragonFly

   The swap file location and size can be specified with BOOTP/DHCP
   DragonFly-specific options 128 and 129. Examples of configuration files
   for ISC DHCP 3.0 or bootpd follow:

    1. Add the following lines to dhcpd.conf:

 # Global section
 option swap-path code 128 = string;
 option swap-size code 129 = integer 32;

 host margaux {
   ... # Standard lines, see above
   option swap-path "192.168.4.4:/netswapvolume/netswap";
   option swap-size 64000;
 }
            

       swap-path is the path to a directory where swap files will be located.
       Each file will be named swap.client-ip.

       Older versions of dhcpd used a syntax of option option-128 "..., which
       is no longer supported.

       /etc/bootptab would use the following syntax instead:

 T128="192.168.4.4:/netswapvolume/netswap":T129=0000fa00

         Note: In /etc/bootptab, the swap size must be expressed in
         hexadecimal format.

    2. On the NFS swap file server, create the swap file(s)

 # mkdir /netswapvolume/netswap
 # cd /netswapvolume/netswap
 # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=64000 of=swap.192.168.4.6
 # chmod 0600 swap.192.168.4.6
            

       192.168.4.6 is the IP address for the diskless client.

    3. On the NFS swap file server, add the following line to /etc/exports:

 /netswapvolume  -maproot=0:10 -alldirs margaux corbieres
            

       Then tell mountd to reread the exports file, as above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.7.2.8 Miscellaneous Issues

      19.7.2.8.1 Running with a Read-only /usr

   If the diskless workstation is configured to run X, you will have to
   adjust the xdm configuration file, which puts the error log on /usr by
   default.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.7.2.8.2 Using a Non-DragonFly Server

   When the server for the root filesystem is not running DragonFly, you will
   have to create the root filesystem on a DragonFly machine, then copy it to
   its destination, using tar or cpio.

   In this situation, there are sometimes problems with the special files in
   /dev, due to differing major/minor integer sizes. A solution to this
   problem is to export a directory from the non-DragonFly server, mount this
   directory onto a DragonFly machine, and run MAKEDEV on the DragonFly
   machine to create the correct device entries.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.8 ISDN

   A good resource for information on ISDN technology and hardware is Dan
   Kegel's ISDN Page.

   A quick simple road map to ISDN follows:

     * If you live in Europe you might want to investigate the ISDN card
       section.

     * If you are planning to use ISDN primarily to connect to the Internet
       with an Internet Provider on a dial-up non-dedicated basis, you might
       look into Terminal Adapters. This will give you the most flexibility,
       with the fewest problems, if you change providers.

     * If you are connecting two LANs together, or connecting to the Internet
       with a dedicated ISDN connection, you might consider the stand alone
       router/bridge option.

   Cost is a significant factor in determining what solution you will choose.
   The following options are listed from least expensive to most expensive.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.8.1 ISDN Cards

   Contributed by Hellmuth Michaelis.

   DragonFly's ISDN implementation supports only the DSS1/Q.931 (or
   Euro-ISDN) standard using passive cards. Some active cards are supported
   where the firmware also supports other signaling protocols; this also
   includes the first supported Primary Rate (PRI) ISDN card.

   The isdn4bsd software allows you to connect to other ISDN routers using
   either IP over raw HDLC or by using synchronous PPP: either by using
   kernel PPP with isppp, a modified sppp(4) driver, or by using userland
   ppp(8). By using userland ppp(8), channel bonding of two or more ISDN
   B-channels is possible. A telephone answering machine application is also
   available as well as many utilities such as a software 300 Baud modem.

   Some growing number of PC ISDN cards are supported under DragonFly and the
   reports show that it is successfully used all over Europe and in many
   other parts of the world.

   The passive ISDN cards supported are mostly the ones with the Infineon
   (formerly Siemens) ISAC/HSCX/IPAC ISDN chipsets, but also ISDN cards with
   chips from Cologne Chip (ISA bus only), PCI cards with Winbond W6692
   chips, some cards with the Tiger300/320/ISAC chipset combinations and some
   vendor specific chipset based cards such as the AVM Fritz!Card PCI V.1.0
   and the AVM Fritz!Card PnP.

   Currently the active supported ISDN cards are the AVM B1 (ISA and PCI) BRI
   cards and the AVM T1 PCI PRI cards.

   For documentation on isdn4bsd, have a look at /usr/share/examples/isdn/
   directory on your DragonFly system or at the homepage of isdn4bsd which
   also has pointers to hints, erratas and much more documentation such as
   the isdn4bsd handbook.

   For questions regarding the installation, configuration and
   troubleshooting isdn4bsd, a freebsd-isdn mailing list is available.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.8.2 ISDN Terminal Adapters

   Terminal adapters (TA), are to ISDN what modems are to regular phone
   lines.

   Most TA's use the standard Hayes modem AT command set, and can be used as
   a drop in replacement for a modem.

   A TA will operate basically the same as a modem except connection and
   throughput speeds will be much faster than your old modem. You will need
   to configure PPP exactly the same as for a modem setup. Make sure you set
   your serial speed as high as possible.

   The main advantage of using a TA to connect to an Internet Provider is
   that you can do Dynamic PPP. As IP address space becomes more and more
   scarce, most providers are not willing to provide you with a static IP
   anymore. Most stand-alone routers are not able to accommodate dynamic IP
   allocation.

   TA's completely rely on the PPP daemon that you are running for their
   features and stability of connection. This allows you to upgrade easily
   from using a modem to ISDN on a DragonFly machine, if you already have PPP
   set up. However, at the same time any problems you experienced with the
   PPP program and are going to persist.

   If you want maximum stability, use the kernel PPP option, not the userland
   PPP.

   The following TA's are known to work with DragonFly:

     * Motorola BitSurfer and Bitsurfer Pro

     * Adtran

   Most other TA's will probably work as well, TA vendors try to make sure
   their product can accept most of the standard modem AT command set.

   The real problem with external TA's is that, like modems, you need a good
   serial card in your computer.

   You should read the DragonFly Serial Hardware tutorial for a detailed
   understanding of serial devices, and the differences between asynchronous
   and synchronous serial ports.

   A TA running off a standard PC serial port (asynchronous) limits you to
   115.2 Kbs, even though you have a 128 Kbs connection. To fully utilize the
   128 Kbs that ISDN is capable of, you must move the TA to a synchronous
   serial card.

   Do not be fooled into buying an internal TA and thinking you have avoided
   the synchronous/asynchronous issue. Internal TA's simply have a standard
   PC serial port chip built into them. All this will do is save you having
   to buy another serial cable and find another empty electrical socket.

   A synchronous card with a TA is at least as fast as a stand-alone router,
   and with a simple 386 DragonFly box driving it, probably more flexible.

   The choice of synchronous card/TA v.s. stand-alone router is largely a
   religious issue. There has been some discussion of this in the mailing
   lists. We suggest you search the archives for the complete discussion.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.8.3 Stand-alone ISDN Bridges/Routers

   ISDN bridges or routers are not at all specific to DragonFly or any other
   operating system. For a more complete description of routing and bridging
   technology, please refer to a networking reference book.

   In the context of this section, the terms router and bridge will be used
   interchangeably.

   As the cost of low end ISDN routers/bridges comes down, it will likely
   become a more and more popular choice. An ISDN router is a small box that
   plugs directly into your local Ethernet network, and manages its own
   connection to the other bridge/router. It has built in software to
   communicate via PPP and other popular protocols.

   A router will allow you much faster throughput than a standard TA, since
   it will be using a full synchronous ISDN connection.

   The main problem with ISDN routers and bridges is that interoperability
   between manufacturers can still be a problem. If you are planning to
   connect to an Internet provider, you should discuss your needs with them.

   If you are planning to connect two LAN segments together, such as your
   home LAN to the office LAN, this is the simplest lowest maintenance
   solution. Since you are buying the equipment for both sides of the
   connection you can be assured that the link will work.

   For example to connect a home computer or branch office network to a head
   office network the following setup could be used:

   Example 19-2. Branch Office or Home Network

   Network uses a bus based topology with 10 base 2 Ethernet (``thinnet'').
   Connect router to network cable with AUI/10BT transceiver, if necessary.

 ---Sun workstation
 |
 ---DragonFly box
 |
 ---Windows 95
 |
 Stand-alone router
    |
 ISDN BRI line

   If your home/branch office is only one computer you can use a twisted pair
   crossover cable to connect to the stand-alone router directly.

   Example 19-3. Head Office or Other LAN

   Network uses a star topology with 10 base T Ethernet (``Twisted Pair'').

     -------Novell Server
     | H |
     |   ---Sun
     |   |
     | U ---DragonFly
     |   |
     |   ---Windows 95
     | B |
     |___---Stand-alone router
                 |
         ISDN BRI line

   One large advantage of most routers/bridges is that they allow you to have
   two separate independent PPP connections to two separate sites at the same
   time. This is not supported on most TA's, except for specific (usually
   expensive) models that have two serial ports. Do not confuse this with
   channel bonding, MPP, etc.

   This can be a very useful feature if, for example, you have an dedicated
   ISDN connection at your office and would like to tap into it, but do not
   want to get another ISDN line at work. A router at the office location can
   manage a dedicated B channel connection (64 Kbps) to the Internet and use
   the other B channel for a separate data connection. The second B channel
   can be used for dial-in, dial-out or dynamically bonding (MPP, etc.) with
   the first B channel for more bandwidth.

   An Ethernet bridge will also allow you to transmit more than just IP
   traffic. You can also send IPX/SPX or whatever other protocols you use.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.9 NIS/YP

   Written by Bill Swingle. Enhanced by Eric Ogren and Udo Erdelhoff.

  19.9.1 What Is It?

   NIS, which stands for Network Information Services, was developed by Sun
   Microsystems to centralize administration of UNIX (originally SunOS)
   systems. It has now essentially become an industry standard; all major
   UNIX like systems (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX(R), Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
   FreeBSD, DragonFly, etc.) support NIS.

   NIS was formerly known as Yellow Pages, but because of trademark issues,
   Sun changed the name. The old term (and yp) is still often seen and used.

   It is a RPC-based client/server system that allows a group of machines
   within an NIS domain to share a common set of configuration files. This
   permits a system administrator to set up NIS client systems with only
   minimal configuration data and add, remove or modify configuration data
   from a single location.

   It is similar to the Windows NT(R) domain system; although the internal
   implementation of the two are not at all similar, the basic functionality
   can be compared.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.2 Terms/Processes You Should Know

   There are several terms and several important user processes that you will
   come across when attempting to implement NIS on DragonFly, whether you are
   trying to create an NIS server or act as an NIS client:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |      Term      |                      Description                      |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |                | An NIS master server and all of its clients           |
   | NIS domainname | (including its slave servers) have a NIS domainname.  |
   |                | Similar to an Windows NT domain name, the NIS         |
   |                | domainname does not have anything to do with DNS.     |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |                | Must be running in order to enable RPC (Remote        |
   | portmap        | Procedure Call, a network protocol used by NIS). If   |
   |                | portmap is not running, it will be impossible to run  |
   |                | an NIS server, or to act as an NIS client.            |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |                | ``Binds'' an NIS client to its NIS server. It will    |
   |                | take the NIS domainname from the system, and using    |
   | ypbind         | RPC, connect to the server. ypbind is the core of     |
   |                | client-server communication in an NIS environment; if |
   |                | ypbind dies on a client machine, it will not be able  |
   |                | to access the NIS server.                             |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |                | Should only be running on NIS servers; this is the    |
   |                | NIS server process itself. If ypserv(8) dies, then    |
   |                | the server will no longer be able to respond to NIS   |
   |                | requests (hopefully, there is a slave server to take  |
   | ypserv         | over for it). There are some implementations of NIS   |
   |                | (but not the DragonFly one), that do not try to       |
   |                | reconnect to another server if the server it used     |
   |                | before dies. Often, the only thing that helps in this |
   |                | case is to restart the server process (or even the    |
   |                | whole server) or the ypbind process on the client.    |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |                | Another process that should only be running on NIS    |
   |                | master servers; this is a daemon that will allow NIS  |
   | rpc.yppasswdd  | clients to change their NIS passwords. If this daemon |
   |                | is not running, users will have to login to the NIS   |
   |                | master server and change their passwords there.       |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.3 How Does It Work?

   There are three types of hosts in an NIS environment: master servers,
   slave servers, and clients. Servers act as a central repository for host
   configuration information. Master servers hold the authoritative copy of
   this information, while slave servers mirror this information for
   redundancy. Clients rely on the servers to provide this information to
   them.

   Information in many files can be shared in this manner. The master.passwd,
   group, and hosts files are commonly shared via NIS. Whenever a process on
   a client needs information that would normally be found in these files
   locally, it makes a query to the NIS server that it is bound to instead.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.9.3.1 Machine Types

     * A NIS master server. This server, analogous to a Windows NT primary
       domain controller, maintains the files used by all of the NIS clients.
       The passwd, group, and other various files used by the NIS clients
       live on the master server.

         Note: It is possible for one machine to be an NIS master server for
         more than one NIS domain. However, this will not be covered in this
         introduction, which assumes a relatively small-scale NIS
         environment.

     * NIS slave servers. Similar to the Windows NT backup domain
       controllers, NIS slave servers maintain copies of the NIS master's
       data files. NIS slave servers provide the redundancy, which is needed
       in important environments. They also help to balance the load of the
       master server: NIS Clients always attach to the NIS server whose
       response they get first, and this includes slave-server-replies.

     * NIS clients. NIS clients, like most Windows NT workstations,
       authenticate against the NIS server (or the Windows NT domain
       controller in the Windows NT Workstation case) to log on.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.4 Using NIS/YP

   This section will deal with setting up a sample NIS environment.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.9.4.1 Planning

   Let us assume that you are the administrator of a small university lab.
   This lab, which consists of 15 DragonFly machines, currently has no
   centralized point of administration; each machine has its own /etc/passwd
   and /etc/master.passwd. These files are kept in sync with each other only
   through manual intervention; currently, when you add a user to the lab,
   you must run adduser on all 15 machines. Clearly, this has to change, so
   you have decided to convert the lab to use NIS, using two of the machines
   as servers.

   Therefore, the configuration of the lab now looks something like:

   +------------------------------------------------------+
   | Machine name |  IP address   |     Machine role      |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
   | ellington    | 10.0.0.2      | NIS master            |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
   | coltrane     | 10.0.0.3      | NIS slave             |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
   | basie        | 10.0.0.4      | Faculty workstation   |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
   | bird         | 10.0.0.5      | Client machine        |
   |--------------+---------------+-----------------------|
   | cli[1-11]    | 10.0.0.[6-17] | Other client machines |
   +------------------------------------------------------+

   If you are setting up a NIS scheme for the first time, it is a good idea
   to think through how you want to go about it. No matter what the size of
   your network, there are a few decisions that need to be made.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.1.1 Choosing a NIS Domain Name

   This might not be the ``domainname'' that you are used to. It is more
   accurately called the ``NIS domainname''. When a client broadcasts its
   requests for info, it includes the name of the NIS domain that it is part
   of. This is how multiple servers on one network can tell which server
   should answer which request. Think of the NIS domainname as the name for a
   group of hosts that are related in some way.

   Some organizations choose to use their Internet domainname for their NIS
   domainname. This is not recommended as it can cause confusion when trying
   to debug network problems. The NIS domainname should be unique within your
   network and it is helpful if it describes the group of machines it
   represents. For example, the Art department at Acme Inc. might be in the
   ``acme-art'' NIS domain. For this example, assume you have chosen the name
   test-domain.

   However, some operating systems (notably SunOS) use their NIS domain name
   as their Internet domain name. If one or more machines on your network
   have this restriction, you must use the Internet domain name as your NIS
   domain name.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.1.2 Physical Server Requirements

   There are several things to keep in mind when choosing a machine to use as
   a NIS server. One of the unfortunate things about NIS is the level of
   dependency the clients have on the server. If a client cannot contact the
   server for its NIS domain, very often the machine becomes unusable. The
   lack of user and group information causes most systems to temporarily
   freeze up. With this in mind you should make sure to choose a machine that
   will not be prone to being rebooted regularly, or one that might be used
   for development. The NIS server should ideally be a stand alone machine
   whose sole purpose in life is to be an NIS server. If you have a network
   that is not very heavily used, it is acceptable to put the NIS server on a
   machine running other services, just keep in mind that if the NIS server
   becomes unavailable, it will affect all of your NIS clients adversely.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.9.4.2 NIS Servers

   The canonical copies of all NIS information are stored on a single machine
   called the NIS master server. The databases used to store the information
   are called NIS maps. In DragonFly, these maps are stored in
   /var/yp/[domainname] where [domainname] is the name of the NIS domain
   being served. A single NIS server can support several domains at once,
   therefore it is possible to have several such directories, one for each
   supported domain. Each domain will have its own independent set of maps.

   NIS master and slave servers handle all NIS requests with the ypserv
   daemon. ypserv is responsible for receiving incoming requests from NIS
   clients, translating the requested domain and map name to a path to the
   corresponding database file and transmitting data from the database back
   to the client.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.2.1 Setting Up a NIS Master Server

   Setting up a master NIS server can be relatively straight forward,
   depending on your needs. DragonFly comes with support for NIS
   out-of-the-box. All you need is to add the following lines to
   /etc/rc.conf, and DragonFly will do the rest for you.

    1. nisdomainname="test-domain"

       This line will set the NIS domainname to test-domain upon network
       setup (e.g. after reboot).

    2. nis_server_enable="YES"

       This will tell DragonFly to start up the NIS server processes when the
       networking is next brought up.

    3. nis_yppasswdd_enable="YES"

       This will enable the rpc.yppasswdd daemon which, as mentioned above,
       will allow users to change their NIS password from a client machine.

     Note: Depending on your NIS setup, you may need to add further entries.
     See the section about NIS servers that are also NIS clients, below, for
     details.

   Now, all you have to do is to run the command /etc/netstart as superuser.
   It will set up everything for you, using the values you defined in
   /etc/rc.conf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.2.2 Initializing the NIS Maps

   The NIS maps are database files, that are kept in the /var/yp directory.
   They are generated from configuration files in the /etc directory of the
   NIS master, with one exception: the /etc/master.passwd file. This is for a
   good reason; you do not want to propagate passwords to your root and other
   administrative accounts to all the servers in the NIS domain. Therefore,
   before we initialize the NIS maps, you should:

 # cp /etc/master.passwd /var/yp/master.passwd
 # cd /var/yp
 # vi master.passwd

   You should remove all entries regarding system accounts (bin, tty, kmem,
   games, etc), as well as any accounts that you do not want to be propagated
   to the NIS clients (for example root and any other UID 0 (superuser)
   accounts).

     Note: Make sure the /var/yp/master.passwd is neither group nor world
     readable (mode 600)! Use the chmod command, if appropriate.

   When you have finished, it is time to initialize the NIS maps! DragonFly
   includes a script named ypinit to do this for you (see its manual page for
   more information). Note that this script is available on most UNIX
   Operating Systems, but not on all. On Digital UNIX/Compaq Tru64 UNIX it is
   called ypsetup. Because we are generating maps for an NIS master, we are
   going to pass the -m option to ypinit. To generate the NIS maps, assuming
   you already performed the steps above, run:

 ellington# ypinit -m test-domain
 Server Type: MASTER Domain: test-domain
 Creating an YP server will require that you answer a few questions.
 Questions will all be asked at the beginning of the procedure.
 Do you want this procedure to quit on non-fatal errors? [y/n: n] n
 Ok, please remember to go back and redo manually whatever fails.
 If you don't, something might not work.
 At this point, we have to construct a list of this domains YP servers.
 rod.darktech.org is already known as master server.
 Please continue to add any slave servers, one per line. When you are
 done with the list, type a <control D>.
 master server   :  ellington
 next host to add:  coltrane
 next host to add:  ^D
 The current list of NIS servers looks like this:
 ellington
 coltrane
 Is this correct?  [y/n: y] y

 [..output from map generation..]

 NIS Map update completed.
 ellington has been setup as an YP master server without any errors.

   ypinit should have created /var/yp/Makefile from /var/yp/Makefile.dist.
   When created, this file assumes that you are operating in a single server
   NIS environment with only DragonFly machines. Since test-domain has a
   slave server as well, you must edit /var/yp/Makefile:

 ellington# vi /var/yp/Makefile

   You should comment out the line that says

 NOPUSH = "True"

   (if it is not commented out already).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.2.3 Setting up a NIS Slave Server

   Setting up an NIS slave server is even more simple than setting up the
   master. Log on to the slave server and edit the file /etc/rc.conf as you
   did before. The only difference is that we now must use the -s option when
   running ypinit. The -s option requires the name of the NIS master be
   passed to it as well, so our command line looks like:

 coltrane# ypinit -s ellington test-domain

 Server Type: SLAVE Domain: test-domain Master: ellington

 Creating an YP server will require that you answer a few questions.
 Questions will all be asked at the beginning of the procedure.

 Do you want this procedure to quit on non-fatal errors? [y/n: n]  n

 Ok, please remember to go back and redo manually whatever fails.
 If you don't, something might not work.
 There will be no further questions. The remainder of the procedure
 should take a few minutes, to copy the databases from ellington.

 coltrane has been setup as an YP slave server without any errors.
 Don't forget to update map ypservers on ellington.

   You should now have a directory called /var/yp/test-domain. Copies of the
   NIS master server's maps should be in this directory. You will need to
   make sure that these stay updated. The following /etc/crontab entries on
   your slave servers should do the job:

 20      *       *       *       *       root   /usr/libexec/ypxfr passwd.byname
 21      *       *       *       *       root   /usr/libexec/ypxfr passwd.byuid

   These two lines force the slave to sync its maps with the maps on the
   master server. Although these entries are not mandatory, since the master
   server attempts to ensure any changes to its NIS maps are communicated to
   its slaves and because password information is vital to systems depending
   on the server, it is a good idea to force the updates. This is more
   important on busy networks where map updates might not always complete.

   Now, run the command /etc/netstart on the slave server as well, which
   again starts the NIS server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.9.4.3 NIS Clients

   An NIS client establishes what is called a binding to a particular NIS
   server using the ypbind daemon. ypbind checks the system's default domain
   (as set by the domainname command), and begins broadcasting RPC requests
   on the local network. These requests specify the name of the domain for
   which ypbind is attempting to establish a binding. If a server that has
   been configured to serve the requested domain receives one of the
   broadcasts, it will respond to ypbind, which will record the server's
   address. If there are several servers available (a master and several
   slaves, for example), ypbind will use the address of the first one to
   respond. From that point on, the client system will direct all of its NIS
   requests to that server. ypbind will occasionally ``ping'' the server to
   make sure it is still up and running. If it fails to receive a reply to
   one of its pings within a reasonable amount of time, ypbind will mark the
   domain as unbound and begin broadcasting again in the hopes of locating
   another server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      19.9.4.3.1 Setting Up a NIS Client

   Setting up a DragonFly machine to be a NIS client is fairly
   straightforward.

    1. Edit the file /etc/rc.conf and add the following lines in order to set
       the NIS domainname and start ypbind upon network startup:

 nisdomainname="test-domain"
 nis_client_enable="YES"

    2. To import all possible password entries from the NIS server, remove
       all user accounts from your /etc/master.passwd file and use vipw to
       add the following line to the end of the file:

 +:::::::::

         Note: This line will afford anyone with a valid account in the NIS
         server's password maps an account. There are many ways to configure
         your NIS client by changing this line. See the netgroups section
         below for more information. For more detailed reading see O'Reilly's
         book on Managing NFS and NIS.

         Note: You should keep at least one local account (i.e. not imported
         via NIS) in your /etc/master.passwd and this account should also be
         a member of the group wheel. If there is something wrong with NIS,
         this account can be used to log in remotely, become root, and fix
         things.

    3. To import all possible group entries from the NIS server, add this
       line to your /etc/group file:

 +:*::

   After completing these steps, you should be able to run ypcat passwd and
   see the NIS server's passwd map.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.5 NIS Security

   In general, any remote user can issue an RPC to ypserv(8) and retrieve the
   contents of your NIS maps, provided the remote user knows your domainname.
   To prevent such unauthorized transactions, ypserv(8) supports a feature
   called securenets which can be used to restrict access to a given set of
   hosts. At startup, ypserv(8) will attempt to load the securenets
   information from a file called /var/yp/securenets.

     Note: This path varies depending on the path specified with the -p
     option. This file contains entries that consist of a network
     specification and a network mask separated by white space. Lines
     starting with ``#'' are considered to be comments. A sample securenets
     file might look like this:

 # allow connections from local host -- mandatory
 127.0.0.1     255.255.255.255
 # allow connections from any host
 # on the 192.168.128.0 network
 192.168.128.0 255.255.255.0
 # allow connections from any host
 # between 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.15.255
 # this includes the machines in the testlab
 10.0.0.0      255.255.240.0

   If ypserv(8) receives a request from an address that matches one of these
   rules, it will process the request normally. If the address fails to match
   a rule, the request will be ignored and a warning message will be logged.
   If the /var/yp/securenets file does not exist, ypserv will allow
   connections from any host.

   The ypserv program also has support for Wietse Venema's tcpwrapper
   package. This allows the administrator to use the tcpwrapper configuration
   files for access control instead of /var/yp/securenets.

     Note: While both of these access control mechanisms provide some
     security, they, like the privileged port test, are vulnerable to ``IP
     spoofing'' attacks. All NIS-related traffic should be blocked at your
     firewall.

     Servers using /var/yp/securenets may fail to serve legitimate NIS
     clients with archaic TCP/IP implementations. Some of these
     implementations set all host bits to zero when doing broadcasts and/or
     fail to observe the subnet mask when calculating the broadcast address.
     While some of these problems can be fixed by changing the client
     configuration, other problems may force the retirement of the client
     systems in question or the abandonment of /var/yp/securenets.

     Using /var/yp/securenets on a server with such an archaic implementation
     of TCP/IP is a really bad idea and will lead to loss of NIS
     functionality for large parts of your network.

     The use of the tcpwrapper package increases the latency of your NIS
     server. The additional delay may be long enough to cause timeouts in
     client programs, especially in busy networks or with slow NIS servers.
     If one or more of your client systems suffers from these symptoms, you
     should convert the client systems in question into NIS slave servers and
     force them to bind to themselves.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.6 Barring Some Users from Logging On

   In our lab, there is a machine basie that is supposed to be a faculty only
   workstation. We do not want to take this machine out of the NIS domain,
   yet the passwd file on the master NIS server contains accounts for both
   faculty and students. What can we do?

   There is a way to bar specific users from logging on to a machine, even if
   they are present in the NIS database. To do this, all you must do is add
   -username to the end of the /etc/master.passwd file on the client machine,
   where username is the username of the user you wish to bar from logging
   in. This should preferably be done using vipw, since vipw will sanity
   check your changes to /etc/master.passwd, as well as automatically rebuild
   the password database when you finish editing. For example, if we wanted
   to bar user bill from logging on to basie we would:

 basie# vipw
 [add -bill to the end, exit]
 vipw: rebuilding the database...
 vipw: done

 basie# cat /etc/master.passwd

 root:[password]:0:0::0:0:The super-user:/root:/bin/csh
 toor:[password]:0:0::0:0:The other super-user:/root:/bin/sh
 daemon:*:1:1::0:0:Owner of many system processes:/root:/sbin/nologin
 operator:*:2:5::0:0:System &:/:/sbin/nologin
 bin:*:3:7::0:0:Binaries Commands and Source,,,:/:/sbin/nologin

  19.9.7 Using Netgroups

   Contributed by Udo Erdelhoff.

   The method shown in the previous section works reasonably well if you need
   special rules for a very small number of users and/or machines. On larger
   networks, you will forget to bar some users from logging onto sensitive
   machines, or you may even have to modify each machine separately, thus
   losing the main benefit of NIS, centralized administration.

   The NIS developers' solution for this problem is called netgroups. Their
   purpose and semantics can be compared to the normal groups used by UNIX
   file systems. The main differences are the lack of a numeric id and the
   ability to define a netgroup by including both user accounts and other
   netgroups.

   Netgroups were developed to handle large, complex networks with hundreds
   of users and machines. On one hand, this is a Good Thing if you are forced
   to deal with such a situation. On the other hand, this complexity makes it
   almost impossible to explain netgroups with really simple examples. The
   example used in the remainder of this section demonstrates this problem.

   Let us assume that your successful introduction of NIS in your laboratory
   caught your superiors' interest. Your next job is to extend your NIS
   domain to cover some of the other machines on campus. The two tables
   contain the names of the new users and new machines as well as brief
   descriptions of them.

   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |       User Name(s)        |               Description                |

   +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |      Machine Name(s)       |                Description                |

   | war, death, famine,        | Your most important servers. Only the IT  |
   | pollution                  | employees are allowed to log onto these   |
   |                            | machines.                                 |
   |----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
   | pride, greed, envy, wrath, | Less important servers. All members of    |
   | lust, sloth                | the IT department are allowed to login    |
   |                            | onto these machines.                      |
   |----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
   |                            | Ordinary workstations. Only the real      |
   | one, two, three, four, ... | employees are allowed to use these        |
   |                            | machines.                                 |
   |----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
   |                            | A very old machine without any critical   |
   | trashcan                   | data. Even the intern is allowed to use   |
   |                            | this box.                                 |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   If you tried to implement these restrictions by separately blocking each
   user, you would have to add one -user line to each system's passwd for
   each user who is not allowed to login onto that system. If you forget just
   one entry, you could be in trouble. It may be feasible to do this
   correctly during the initial setup, however you will eventually forget to
   add the lines for new users during day-to-day operations. After all,
   Murphy was an optimist.

   Handling this situation with netgroups offers several advantages. Each
   user need not be handled separately; you assign a user to one or more
   netgroups and allow or forbid logins for all members of the netgroup. If
   you add a new machine, you will only have to define login restrictions for
   netgroups. If a new user is added, you will only have to add the user to
   one or more netgroups. Those changes are independent of each other; no
   more ``for each combination of user and machine do...'' If your NIS setup
   is planned carefully, you will only have to modify exactly one central
   configuration file to grant or deny access to machines.

   The first step is the initialization of the NIS map netgroup. DragonFly's
   ypinit(8) does not create this map by default, but its NIS implementation
   will support it once it has been created. To create an empty map, simply
   type

 ellington# vi /var/yp/netgroup

   and start adding content. For our example, we need at least four
   netgroups: IT employees, IT apprentices, normal employees and interns.

 IT_EMP  (,alpha,test-domain)    (,beta,test-domain)
 IT_APP  (,charlie,test-domain)  (,delta,test-domain)
 USERS   (,echo,test-domain)     (,foxtrott,test-domain) \
         (,golf,test-domain)
 INTERNS (,able,test-domain)     (,baker,test-domain)

   IT_EMP, IT_APP etc. are the names of the netgroups. Each bracketed group
   adds one or more user accounts to it. The three fields inside a group are:

    1. The name of the host(s) where the following items are valid. If you do
       not specify a hostname, the entry is valid on all hosts. If you do
       specify a hostname, you will enter a realm of darkness, horror and
       utter confusion.

    2. The name of the account that belongs to this netgroup.

    3. The NIS domain for the account. You can import accounts from other NIS
       domains into your netgroup if you are one of the unlucky fellows with
       more than one NIS domain.

   Each of these fields can contain wildcards. See netgroup(5) for details.

     Note: Netgroup names longer than 8 characters should not be used,
     especially if you have machines running other operating systems within
     your NIS domain. The names are case sensitive; using capital letters for
     your netgroup names is an easy way to distinguish between user, machine
     and netgroup names.

     Some NIS clients (other than DragonFly) cannot handle netgroups with a
     large number of entries. For example, some older versions of SunOS start
     to cause trouble if a netgroup contains more than 15 entries. You can
     circumvent this limit by creating several sub-netgroups with 15 users or
     less and a real netgroup that consists of the sub-netgroups:

 BIGGRP1  (,joe1,domain)  (,joe2,domain)  (,joe3,domain) [...]
 BIGGRP2  (,joe16,domain)  (,joe17,domain) [...]
 BIGGRP3  (,joe31,domain)  (,joe32,domain)
 BIGGROUP  BIGGRP1 BIGGRP2 BIGGRP3

     You can repeat this process if you need more than 225 users within a
     single netgroup.

   Activating and distributing your new NIS map is easy:

 ellington# cd /var/yp
 ellington# make

   This will generate the three NIS maps netgroup, netgroup.byhost and
   netgroup.byuser. Use ypcat(1) to check if your new NIS maps are available:

 ellington% ypcat -k netgroup
 ellington% ypcat -k netgroup.byhost
 ellington% ypcat -k netgroup.byuser

   The output of the first command should resemble the contents of
   /var/yp/netgroup. The second command will not produce output if you have
   not specified host-specific netgroups. The third command can be used to
   get the list of netgroups for a user.

   The client setup is quite simple. To configure the server war, you only
   have to start vipw(8) and replace the line

 +:::::::::

   with

 +@IT_EMP:::::::::

   Now, only the data for the users defined in the netgroup IT_EMP is
   imported into war's password database and only these users are allowed to
   login.

   Unfortunately, this limitation also applies to the ~ function of the shell
   and all routines converting between user names and numerical user IDs. In
   other words, cd ~user will not work, ls -l will show the numerical id
   instead of the username and find . -user joe -print will fail with ``No
   such user''. To fix this, you will have to import all user entries without
   allowing them to login onto your servers.

   This can be achieved by adding another line to /etc/master.passwd. This
   line should contain:

   +:::::::::/sbin/nologin, meaning ``Import all entries but replace the
   shell with /sbin/nologin in the imported entries''. You can replace any
   field in the passwd entry by placing a default value in your
   /etc/master.passwd.

     Warning: Make sure that the line +:::::::::/sbin/nologin is placed after
     +@IT_EMP:::::::::. Otherwise, all user accounts imported from NIS will
     have /sbin/nologin as their login shell.

   After this change, you will only have to change one NIS map if a new
   employee joins the IT department. You could use a similar approach for the
   less important servers by replacing the old +::::::::: in their local
   version of /etc/master.passwd with something like this:

 +@IT_EMP:::::::::
 +@IT_APP:::::::::
 +:::::::::/sbin/nologin

   The corresponding lines for the normal workstations could be:

 +@IT_EMP:::::::::
 +@USERS:::::::::
 +:::::::::/sbin/nologin

   And everything would be fine until there is a policy change a few weeks
   later: The IT department starts hiring interns. The IT interns are allowed
   to use the normal workstations and the less important servers; and the IT
   apprentices are allowed to login onto the main servers. You add a new
   netgroup IT_INTERN, add the new IT interns to this netgroup and start to
   change the config on each and every machine... As the old saying goes:
   ``Errors in centralized planning lead to global mess''.

   NIS' ability to create netgroups from other netgroups can be used to
   prevent situations like these. One possibility is the creation of
   role-based netgroups. For example, you could create a netgroup called
   BIGSRV to define the login restrictions for the important servers, another
   netgroup called SMALLSRV for the less important servers and a third
   netgroup called USERBOX for the normal workstations. Each of these
   netgroups contains the netgroups that are allowed to login onto these
   machines. The new entries for your NIS map netgroup should look like this:

 BIGSRV    IT_EMP  IT_APP
 SMALLSRV  IT_EMP  IT_APP  ITINTERN
 USERBOX   IT_EMP  ITINTERN USERS

   This method of defining login restrictions works reasonably well if you
   can define groups of machines with identical restrictions. Unfortunately,
   this is the exception and not the rule. Most of the time, you will need
   the ability to define login restrictions on a per-machine basis.

   Machine-specific netgroup definitions are the other possibility to deal
   with the policy change outlined above. In this scenario, the
   /etc/master.passwd of each box contains two lines starting with ``+''. The
   first of them adds a netgroup with the accounts allowed to login onto this
   machine, the second one adds all other accounts with /sbin/nologin as
   shell. It is a good idea to use the ALL-CAPS version of the machine name
   as the name of the netgroup. In other words, the lines should look like
   this:

 +@BOXNAME:::::::::
 +:::::::::/sbin/nologin

   Once you have completed this task for all your machines, you will not have
   to modify the local versions of /etc/master.passwd ever again. All further
   changes can be handled by modifying the NIS map. Here is an example of a
   possible netgroup map for this scenario with some additional goodies.

 # Define groups of users first
 IT_EMP    (,alpha,test-domain)    (,beta,test-domain)
 IT_APP    (,charlie,test-domain)  (,delta,test-domain)
 DEPT1     (,echo,test-domain)     (,foxtrott,test-domain)
 DEPT2     (,golf,test-domain)     (,hotel,test-domain)
 DEPT3     (,india,test-domain)    (,juliet,test-domain)
 ITINTERN  (,kilo,test-domain)     (,lima,test-domain)
 D_INTERNS (,able,test-domain)     (,baker,test-domain)
 #
 # Now, define some groups based on roles
 USERS     DEPT1   DEPT2     DEPT3
 BIGSRV    IT_EMP  IT_APP
 SMALLSRV  IT_EMP  IT_APP    ITINTERN
 USERBOX   IT_EMP  ITINTERN  USERS
 #
 # And a groups for a special tasks
 # Allow echo and golf to access our anti-virus-machine
 SECURITY  IT_EMP  (,echo,test-domain)  (,golf,test-domain)
 #
 # machine-based netgroups
 # Our main servers
 WAR       BIGSRV
 FAMINE    BIGSRV
 # User india needs access to this server
 POLLUTION  BIGSRV  (,india,test-domain)
 #
 # This one is really important and needs more access restrictions
 DEATH     IT_EMP
 #
 # The anti-virus-machine mentioned above
 ONE       SECURITY
 #
 # Restrict a machine to a single user
 TWO       (,hotel,test-domain)
 # [...more groups to follow]

   If you are using some kind of database to manage your user accounts, you
   should be able to create the first part of the map with your database's
   report tools. This way, new users will automatically have access to the
   boxes.

   One last word of caution: It may not always be advisable to use
   machine-based netgroups. If you are deploying a couple of dozen or even
   hundreds of identical machines for student labs, you should use role-based
   netgroups instead of machine-based netgroups to keep the size of the NIS
   map within reasonable limits.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.8 Important Things to Remember

   There are still a couple of things that you will need to do differently
   now that you are in an NIS environment.

     * Every time you wish to add a user to the lab, you must add it to the
       master NIS server only, and you must remember to rebuild the NIS maps.
       If you forget to do this, the new user will not be able to login
       anywhere except on the NIS master. For example, if we needed to add a
       new user ``jsmith'' to the lab, we would:

 # pw useradd jsmith
 # cd /var/yp
 # make test-domain

       You could also run adduser jsmith instead of pw useradd jsmith.

     * Keep the administration accounts out of the NIS maps. You do not want
       to be propagating administrative accounts and passwords to machines
       that will have users that should not have access to those accounts.

     * Keep the NIS master and slave secure, and minimize their downtime. If
       somebody either hacks or simply turns off these machines, they have
       effectively rendered many people without the ability to login to the
       lab.

       This is the chief weakness of any centralized administration system.
       If you do not protect your NIS servers, you will have a lot of angry
       users!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.9 NIS v1 Compatibility

   DragonFly's ypserv has some support for serving NIS v1 clients.
   DragonFly's NIS implementation only uses the NIS v2 protocol, however
   other implementations include support for the v1 protocol for backwards
   compatibility with older systems. The ypbind daemons supplied with these
   systems will try to establish a binding to an NIS v1 server even though
   they may never actually need it (and they may persist in broadcasting in
   search of one even after they receive a response from a v2 server). Note
   that while support for normal client calls is provided, this version of
   ypserv does not handle v1 map transfer requests; consequently, it cannot
   be used as a master or slave in conjunction with older NIS servers that
   only support the v1 protocol. Fortunately, there probably are not any such
   servers still in use today.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.10 NIS Servers That Are Also NIS Clients

   Care must be taken when running ypserv in a multi-server domain where the
   server machines are also NIS clients. It is generally a good idea to force
   the servers to bind to themselves rather than allowing them to broadcast
   bind requests and possibly become bound to each other. Strange failure
   modes can result if one server goes down and others are dependent upon it.
   Eventually all the clients will time out and attempt to bind to other
   servers, but the delay involved can be considerable and the failure mode
   is still present since the servers might bind to each other all over
   again.

   You can force a host to bind to a particular server by running ypbind with
   the -S flag. If you do not want to do this manually each time you reboot
   your NIS server, you can add the following lines to your /etc/rc.conf:

 nis_client_enable="YES" # run client stuff as well
 nis_client_flags="-S NIS domain,server"

   See ypbind(8) for further information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.9.11 Password Formats

   One of the most common issues that people run into when trying to
   implement NIS is password format compatibility. If your NIS server is
   using DES encrypted passwords, it will only support clients that are also
   using DES. For example, if you have Solaris NIS clients in your network,
   then you will almost certainly need to use DES encrypted passwords.

   To check which format your servers and clients are using, look at
   /etc/login.conf. If the host is configured to use DES encrypted passwords,
   then the default class will contain an entry like this:

 default:\
         :passwd_format=des:\
         :copyright=/etc/COPYRIGHT:\
         [Further entries elided]

   Other possible values for the passwd_format capability include blf and md5
   (for Blowfish and MD5 encrypted passwords, respectively).

   If you have made changes to /etc/login.conf, you will also need to rebuild
   the login capability database, which is achieved by running the following
   command as root:

 # cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

     Note: The format of passwords already in /etc/master.passwd will not be
     updated until a user changes their password for the first time after the
     login capability database is rebuilt.

   Next, in order to ensure that passwords are encrypted with the format that
   you have chosen, you should also check that the crypt_default in
   /etc/auth.conf gives precedence to your chosen password format. To do
   this, place the format that you have chosen first in the list. For
   example, when using DES encrypted passwords, the entry would be:

 crypt_default   =       des blf md5

   Having followed the above steps on each of the DragonFly based NIS servers
   and clients, you can be sure that they all agree on which password format
   is used within your network. If you have trouble authenticating on an NIS
   client, this is a pretty good place to start looking for possible
   problems. Remember: if you want to deploy an NIS server for a heterogenous
   network, you will probably have to use DES on all systems because it is
   the lowest common standard.

19.10 DHCP

   Written by Greg Sutter.

  19.10.1 What Is DHCP?

   DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, describes the means by
   which a system can connect to a network and obtain the necessary
   information for communication upon that network. DragonFly uses the ISC
   (Internet Software Consortium) DHCP implementation, so all
   implementation-specific information here is for use with the ISC
   distribution.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.2 What This Section Covers

   This section describes both the client-side and server-side components of
   the ISC DHCP system. The client-side program, dhclient, and the server,
   come integrated within DragonFly. The dhclient(8), dhcp-options(5), and
   dhclient.conf(5) manual pages, in addition to the references below, are
   useful resources.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.3 How It Works

   When dhclient, the DHCP client, is executed on the client machine, it
   begins broadcasting requests for configuration information. By default,
   these requests are on UDP port 68. The server replies on UDP 67, giving
   the client an IP address and other relevant network information such as
   netmask, router, and DNS servers. All of this information comes in the
   form of a DHCP ``lease'' and is only valid for a certain time (configured
   by the DHCP server maintainer). In this manner, stale IP addresses for
   clients no longer connected to the network can be automatically reclaimed.

   DHCP clients can obtain a great deal of information from the server. An
   exhaustive list may be found in dhcp-options(5).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.4 DragonFly Integration

   DragonFly fully integrates the ISC DHCP client, dhclient. DHCP client
   support is provided within both the installer and the base system,
   obviating the need for detailed knowledge of network configurations on any
   network that runs a DHCP server.

   There are two things you must do to have your system use DHCP upon
   startup:

     * Make sure that the bpf device is compiled into your kernel. To do
       this, add pseudo-device bpf to your kernel configuration file, and
       rebuild the kernel. For more information about building kernels, see
       Chapter 9.

       The bpf device is already part of the GENERIC kernel that is supplied
       with DragonFly, so if you do not have a custom kernel, you should not
       need to create one in order to get DHCP working.

         Note: For those who are particularly security conscious, you should
         be warned that bpf is also the device that allows packet sniffers to
         work correctly (although they still have to be run as root). bpf is
         required to use DHCP, but if you are very sensitive about security,
         you probably should not add bpf to your kernel in the expectation
         that at some point in the future you will be using DHCP.

     * Edit your /etc/rc.conf to include the following:

 ifconfig_fxp0="DHCP"

         Note: Be sure to replace fxp0 with the designation for the interface
         that you wish to dynamically configure, as described in Section 6.8.

       If you are using a different location for dhclient, or if you wish to
       pass additional flags to dhclient, also include the following (editing
       as necessary):

 dhcp_program="/sbin/dhclient"
 dhcp_flags=""

   The DHCP server, dhcpd, is included as part of the net/isc-dhcp3-server
   port in the ports collection. This port contains the ISC DHCP server and
   documentation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.5 Files

     * /etc/dhclient.conf

       dhclient requires a configuration file, /etc/dhclient.conf. Typically
       the file contains only comments, the defaults being reasonably sane.
       This configuration file is described by the dhclient.conf(5) manual
       page.

     * /sbin/dhclient

       dhclient is statically linked and resides in /sbin. The dhclient(8)
       manual page gives more information about dhclient.

     * /sbin/dhclient-script

       dhclient-script is the DragonFly-specific DHCP client configuration
       script. It is described in dhclient-script(8), but should not need any
       user modification to function properly.

     * /var/db/dhclient.leases

       The DHCP client keeps a database of valid leases in this file, which
       is written as a log. dhclient.leases(5) gives a slightly longer
       description.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.6 Further Reading

   The DHCP protocol is fully described in RFC 2131. An informational
   resource has also been set up at dhcp.org.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.10.7 Installing and Configuring a DHCP Server

    19.10.7.1 What This Section Covers

   This section provides information on how to configure a DragonFly system
   to act as a DHCP server using the ISC (Internet Software Consortium)
   implementation of the DHCP suite.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.10.7.2 DHCP Server Installation

   In order to configure your DragonFly system as a DHCP server, you will
   need to ensure that the bpf(4) device is compiled into your kernel. To do
   this, add pseudo-device bpf to your kernel configuration file, and rebuild
   the kernel. For more information about building kernels, see Chapter 9.

   The bpf device is already part of the GENERIC kernel that is supplied with
   DragonFly, so you do not need to create a custom kernel in order to get
   DHCP working.

     Note: Those who are particularly security conscious should note that bpf
     is also the device that allows packet sniffers to work correctly
     (although such programs still need privileged access). bpf is required
     to use DHCP, but if you are very sensitive about security, you probably
     should not include bpf in your kernel purely because you expect to use
     DHCP at some point in the future.

   The next thing that you will need to do is edit the sample dhcpd.conf
   which was installed by the net/isc-dhcp3-server port. By default, this
   will be /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample, and you should copy this to
   /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf before proceeding to make changes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.10.7.3 Configuring the DHCP Server

   dhcpd.conf is comprised of declarations regarding subnets and hosts, and
   is perhaps most easily explained using an example :

 option domain-name "example.com";(1)
 option domain-name-servers 192.168.4.100;(2)
 option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;(3)

 default-lease-time 3600;(4)
 max-lease-time 86400;(5)
 ddns-update-style none;(6)

 subnet 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   range 192.168.4.129 192.168.4.254;(7)
   option routers 192.168.4.1;(8)
 }

 host mailhost {
   hardware ethernet 02:03:04:05:06:07;(9)
   fixed-address mailhost.example.com;(10)
 }

   (1)
           This option specifies the domain that will be provided to clients
           as the default search domain. See resolv.conf(5) for more
           information on what this means.
   (2)
           This option specifies a comma separated list of DNS servers that
           the client should use.
   (3)
           The netmask that will be provided to clients.
   (4)
           A client may request a specific length of time that a lease will
           be valid. Otherwise the server will assign a lease with this
           expiry value (in seconds).
   (5)
           This is the maximum length of time that the server will lease for.
           Should a client request a longer lease, a lease will be issued,
           although it will only be valid for max-lease-time seconds.
   (6)
           This option specifies whether the DHCP server should attempt to
           update DNS when a lease is accepted or released. In the ISC
           implementation, this option is required.
   (7)
           This denotes which IP addresses should be used in the pool
           reserved for allocating to clients. IP addresses between, and
           including, the ones stated are handed out to clients.
   (8)
           Declares the default gateway that will be provided to clients.
   (9)
           The hardware MAC address of a host (so that the DHCP server can
           recognize a host when it makes a request).
   (10)
           Specifies that the host should always be given the same IP
           address. Note that using a hostname is correct here, since the
           DHCP server will resolve the hostname itself before returning the
           lease information.

   Once you have finished writing your dhcpd.conf, you can proceed to start
   the server by issuing the following command:

 # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh start

   Should you need to make changes to the configuration of your server in the
   future, it is important to note that sending a SIGHUP signal to dhcpd does
   not result in the configuration being reloaded, as it does with most
   daemons. You will need to send a SIGTERM signal to stop the process, and
   then restart it using the command above.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.10.7.4 Files

     * /usr/sbin/dhcpd

       dhcpd is statically linked and resides in /usr/local/sbin. The
       dhcpd(8) manual page installed with the port gives more information
       about dhcpd.

     * /etc/dhcpd.conf

       dhcpd requires a configuration file, /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf before
       it will start providing service to clients. This file needs to contain
       all the information that should be provided to clients that are being
       serviced, along with information regarding the operation of the
       server. This configuration file is described by the dhcpd.conf(5)
       manual page installed by the port.

     * /var/db/dhcpd.leases

       The DHCP server keeps a database of leases it has issued in this file,
       which is written as a log. The manual page dhcpd.leases(5), installed
       by the port gives a slightly longer description.

     * /usr/sbin/dhcrelay

       dhcrelay is used in advanced environments where one DHCP server
       forwards a request from a client to another DHCP server on a separate
       network.

19.11 DNS

   Contributed by Chern Lee.

  19.11.1 Overview

   DragonFly utilizes, by default, a version of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name
   Domain), which is the most common implementation of the DNS protocol. DNS
   is the protocol through which names are mapped to IP addresses, and vice
   versa. For example, a query for www.dragonflybsd.org will receive a reply
   with the IP address of The DragonFly Project's web server, whereas, a
   query for ftp.dragonflybsd.org will return the IP address of the
   corresponding FTP machine. Likewise, the opposite can happen. A query for
   an IP address can resolve its hostname. It is not necessary to run a name
   server to perform DNS lookups on a system.

   DNS is coordinated across the Internet through a somewhat complex system
   of authoritative root name servers, and other smaller-scale name servers
   who host and cache individual domain information.

   This document refers to BIND 9.x.

   RFC1034 and RFC1035 dictate the DNS protocol.

   Currently, BIND is maintained by the Internet Software Consortium
   (www.isc.org).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.2 Terminology

   To understand this document, some terms related to DNS must be understood.

             Term                              Definition                     
   Forward DNS              Mapping of hostnames to IP addresses              
   Origin                   Refers to the domain covered in a particular zone 
                            file                                              
   named, BIND, name server Common names for the BIND name server package     
                            within DragonFly                                  
   Resolver                 A system process through which a machine queries  
                            a name server for zone information                
   Reverse DNS              The opposite of forward DNS; mapping of IP        
                            addresses to hostnames                            
                            The beginning of the Internet zone hierarchy. All 
   Root zone                zones fall under the root zone, similar to how    
                            all files in a file system fall under the root    
                            directory.                                        
   Zone                     An individual domain, subdomain, or portion of    
                            the DNS administered by the same authority        

   Examples of zones:

     * . is the root zone

     * org. is a zone under the root zone

     * example.org is a zone under the org. zone

     * foo.example.org. is a subdomain, a zone under the example.org. zone

     * 1.2.3.in-addr.arpa is a zone referencing all IP addresses which fall
       under the 3.2.1.* IP space.

   As one can see, the more specific part of a hostname appears to its left.
   For example, example.org. is more specific than org., as org. is more
   specific than the root zone. The layout of each part of a hostname is much
   like a filesystem: the /dev directory falls within the root, and so on.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.3 Reasons to Run a Name Server

   Name servers usually come in two forms: an authoritative name server, and
   a caching name server.

   An authoritative name server is needed when:

     * one wants to serve DNS information to the world, replying
       authoritatively to queries.

     * a domain, such as example.org, is registered and IP addresses need to
       be assigned to hostnames under it.

     * an IP address block requires reverse DNS entries (IP to hostname).

     * a backup name server, called a slave, must reply to queries when the
       primary is down or inaccessible.

   A caching name server is needed when:

     * a local DNS server may cache and respond more quickly than querying an
       outside name server.

     * a reduction in overall network traffic is desired (DNS traffic has
       been measured to account for 5% or more of total Internet traffic).

   When one queries for www.dragonflybsd.org, the resolver usually queries
   the uplink ISP's name server, and retrieves the reply. With a local,
   caching DNS server, the query only has to be made once to the outside
   world by the caching DNS server. Every additional query will not have to
   look to the outside of the local network, since the information is cached
   locally.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.4 How It Works

   In DragonFly, the BIND daemon is called named for obvious reasons.

            File                           Description                  
   named                  the BIND daemon                               
   ndc                    name daemon control program                   
   /etc/namedb            directory where BIND zone information resides 
   /etc/namedb/named.conf daemon configuration file                     

   Zone files are usually contained within the /etc/namedb directory, and
   contain the DNS zone information served by the name server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.5 Starting BIND

   Since BIND is installed by default, configuring it all is relatively
   simple.

   To ensure the named daemon is started at boot, put the following
   modifications in /etc/rc.conf:

 named_enable="YES"

   To start the daemon manually (after configuring it)

 # ndc start

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.6 Configuration Files

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.11.6.1 Using make-localhost

   Be sure to:

 # cd /etc/namedb
 # sh make-localhost

   to properly create the local reverse DNS zone file in
   /etc/namedb/localhost.rev.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.11.6.2 /etc/namedb/named.conf

 // Refer to the named(8) manual page for details.  If you are ever going
 // to setup a primary server, make sure you've understood the hairy
 // details of how DNS is working.  Even with simple mistakes, you can
 // break connectivity for affected parties, or cause huge amount of
 // useless Internet traffic.

 options {
         directory "/etc/namedb";

 // In addition to the "forwarders" clause, you can force your name
 // server to never initiate queries of its own, but always ask its
 // forwarders only, by enabling the following line:
 //
 //      forward only;

 // If you've got a DNS server around at your upstream provider, enter
 // its IP address here, and enable the line below.  This will make you
 // benefit from its cache, thus reduce overall DNS traffic in the
 Internet.
 /*
         forwarders {
                 127.0.0.1;
         };
 */

   Just as the comment says, to benefit from an uplink's cache, forwarders
   can be enabled here. Under normal circumstances, a name server will
   recursively query the Internet looking at certain name servers until it
   finds the answer it is looking for. Having this enabled will have it query
   the uplink's name server (or name server provided) first, taking advantage
   of its cache. If the uplink name server in question is a heavily
   trafficked, fast name server, enabling this may be worthwhile.

     Warning: 127.0.0.1 will not work here. Change this IP address to a name
     server at your uplink.

         /*
          * If there is a firewall between you and name servers you want
          * to talk to, you might need to uncomment the query-source
          * directive below.  Previous versions of BIND always asked
          * questions using port 53, but BIND 8.1 uses an unprivileged
          * port by default.
          */
         // query-source address * port 53;

         /*
          * If running in a sandbox, you may have to specify a different
          * location for the dumpfile.
          */
         // dump-file "s/named_dump.db";
 };

 // Note: the following will be supported in a future release.
 /*
 host { any; } {
         topology {
                 127.0.0.0/8;
         };
 };
 */

 // Setting up secondaries is way easier and the rough picture for this
 // is explained below.
 //
 // If you enable a local name server, don't forget to enter 127.0.0.1
 // into your /etc/resolv.conf so this server will be queried first.
 // Also, make sure to enable it in /etc/rc.conf.

         type master;
         file "localhost.rev";
 };

 // NB: Do not use the IP addresses below, they are faked, and only
 // serve demonstration/documentation purposes!
 //
 // Example secondary config entries.  It can be convenient to become

 // primary.
 //
 // Never forget to include the reverse lookup (IN-ADDR.ARPA) zone!
 // (This is the first bytes of the respective IP address, in reverse
 // order, with ".IN-ADDR.ARPA" appended.)
 //
 // Before starting to setup a primary zone, better make sure you fully
 // understand how DNS and BIND works, however.  There are sometimes
 // unobvious pitfalls.  Setting up a secondary is comparably simpler.
 //
 // NB: Don't blindly enable the examples below. :-)  Use actual names
 // and addresses instead.
 //
 // NOTE!!! DragonFly runs bind in a sandbox (see named_flags in rc.conf).
 // The directory containing the secondary zones must be write accessible
 // to bind.  The following sequence is suggested:
 //
 //      mkdir /etc/namedb/s
 //      chown bind:bind /etc/namedb/s
 //      chmod 750 /etc/namedb/s

   For more information on running BIND in a sandbox, see Running named in a
   sandbox.

 /*

         };
 };
 */

   In named.conf, these are examples of slave entries for a forward and
   reverse zone.

   For each new zone served, a new zone entry must be added to named.conf

   For example, the simplest zone entry for example.org can look like:

 zone "example.org" {
         type master;
         file "example.org";
 };

   The zone is a master, as indicated by the type statement, holding its zone
   information in /etc/namedb/example.org indicated by the file statement.

 zone "example.org" {
         type slave;
         file "example.org";
 };

   In the slave case, the zone information is transferred from the master
   name server for the particular zone, and saved in the file specified. If
   and when the master server dies or is unreachable, the slave name server
   will have the transferred zone information and will be able to serve it.

    19.11.6.3 Zone Files

   An example master zone file for example.org (existing within
   /etc/namedb/example.org) is as follows:

 $TTL 3600

 example.org. IN SOA ns1.example.org. admin.example.org. (
                         5               ; Serial
                         10800           ; Refresh
                         3600            ; Retry
                         604800          ; Expire
                         86400 )         ; Minimum TTL

 ; DNS Servers
 @       IN NS           ns1.example.org.
 @       IN NS           ns2.example.org.

 ; Machine Names
 localhost       IN A    127.0.0.1
 ns1             IN A    3.2.1.2
 ns2             IN A    3.2.1.3
 mail            IN A    3.2.1.10
 @               IN A    3.2.1.30

 ; Aliases
 www             IN CNAME        @

 ; MX Record
 @               IN MX   10      mail.example.org.

   Note that every hostname ending in a ``.'' is an exact hostname, whereas
   everything without a trailing ``.'' is referenced to the origin. For
   example, www is translated into www + origin. In our fictitious zone file,
   our origin is example.org., so www would translate to www.example.org.

   The format of a zone file follows:

 recordname      IN recordtype   value

   The most commonly used DNS records:

   SOA

           start of zone authority

   NS

           an authoritative name server

   A

           A host address

   CNAME

           the canonical name for an alias

   MX

           mail exchanger

   PTR

           a domain name pointer (used in reverse DNS)

 example.org. IN SOA ns1.example.org. admin.example.org. (
                         5               ; Serial
                         10800           ; Refresh after 3 hours
                         3600            ; Retry after 1 hour
                         604800          ; Expire after 1 week
                         86400 )         ; Minimum TTL of 1 day

   example.org.

           the domain name, also the origin for this zone file.

   ns1.example.org.

           the primary/authoritative name server for this zone

   admin.example.org.

           the responsible person for this zone, email address with @
           replaced. (<admin@example.org> becomes admin.example.org)

   5

           the serial number of the file. this must be incremented each time
           the zone file is modified. Nowadays, many admins prefer a
           yyyymmddrr format for the serial number. 2001041002 would mean
           last modified 04/10/2001, the latter 02 being the second time the
           zone file has been modified this day. The serial number is
           important as it alerts slave name servers for a zone when it is
           updated.

 @       IN NS           ns1.example.org.

   This is an NS entry. Every name server that is going to reply
   authoritatively for the zone must have one of these entries. The @ as seen
   here could have been example.org. The @ translates to the origin.

 localhost       IN A    127.0.0.1
 ns1             IN A    3.2.1.2
 ns2             IN A    3.2.1.3
 mail            IN A    3.2.1.10
 @               IN A    3.2.1.30

   The A record indicates machine names. As seen above, ns1.example.org would
   resolve to 3.2.1.2. Again, the origin symbol, @, is used here, thus
   meaning example.org would resolve to 3.2.1.30.

 www             IN CNAME        @

   The canonical name record is usually used for giving aliases to a machine.
   In the example, www is aliased to the machine addressed to the origin, or
   example.org (3.2.1.30). CNAMEs can be used to provide alias hostnames, or
   round robin one hostname among multiple machines.

 @               IN MX   10      mail.example.org.

   The MX record indicates which mail servers are responsible for handling
   incoming mail for the zone. mail.example.org is the hostname of the mail
   server, and 10 being the priority of that mail server.

   One can have several mail servers, with priorities of 3, 2, 1. A mail
   server attempting to deliver to example.org would first try the highest
   priority MX, then the second highest, etc, until the mail can be properly
   delivered.

   For in-addr.arpa zone files (reverse DNS), the same format is used, except
   with PTR entries instead of A or CNAME.

 $TTL 3600

 1.2.3.in-addr.arpa. IN SOA ns1.example.org. admin.example.org. (
                         5               ; Serial
                         10800           ; Refresh
                         3600            ; Retry
                         604800          ; Expire
                         3600 )          ; Minimum

 @       IN NS   ns1.example.org.
 @       IN NS   ns2.example.org.

 2       IN PTR  ns1.example.org.
 3       IN PTR  ns2.example.org.
 10      IN PTR  mail.example.org.
 30      IN PTR  example.org.

   This file gives the proper IP address to hostname mappings of our above
   fictitious domain.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.7 Caching Name Server

   A caching name server is a name server that is not authoritative for any
   zones. It simply asks queries of its own, and remembers them for later
   use. To set one up, just configure the name server as usual, omitting any
   inclusions of zones.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.8 Running named in a Sandbox

   For added security you may want to run named(8) as an unprivileged user,
   and configure it to chroot(8) into a sandbox directory. This makes
   everything outside of the sandbox inaccessible to the named daemon. Should
   named be compromised, this will help to reduce the damage that can be
   caused. By default, DragonFly has a user and a group called bind, intended
   for this use.

     Note: Various people would recommend that instead of configuring named
     to chroot, you should run named inside a jail(8). This section does not
     attempt to cover this situation.

   Since named will not be able to access anything outside of the sandbox
   (such as shared libraries, log sockets, and so on), there are a number of
   steps that need to be followed in order to allow named to function
   correctly. In the following checklist, it is assumed that the path to the
   sandbox is /etc/namedb and that you have made no prior modifications to
   the contents of this directory. Perform the following steps as root.

     * Create all directories that named expects to see:

 # cd /etc/namedb
 # mkdir -p bin dev etc var/tmp var/run master slave
 # chown bind:bind slave var/*(1)

            (1)
                    named only needs write access to these directories, so
                    that is all we give it.
     * Rearrange and create basic zone and configuration files:

 # cp /etc/localtime etc(1)
 # mv named.conf etc && ln -sf etc/named.conf
 # mv named.root master
 # sh make-localhost && mv localhost.rev localhost-v6.rev master
 # cat > master/named.localhost
 $ORIGIN localhost.
 $TTL 6h
 @       IN      SOA     localhost. postmaster.localhost. (
                         1       ; serial
                         3600    ; refresh
                         1800    ; retry
                         604800  ; expiration
                         3600 )  ; minimum
         IN      NS      localhost.
         IN      A               127.0.0.1
 ^D

            (1)
                    This allows named to log the correct time to syslogd(8)
     * Use cp(1) to copy named-xfer in /usr/libexec into your sandbox.

     * Make a dev/null that named can see and write to:

 # cd /etc/namedb/dev && mknod null c 2 2
 # chmod 666 null

     * Symlink /var/run/ndc to /etc/namedb/var/run/ndc:

 # ln -sf /etc/namedb/var/run/ndc /var/run/ndc

         Note: This simply avoids having to specify the -c option to ndc(8)
         every time you run it. Since the contents of /var/run are deleted on
         boot, if this is something that you find useful you may wish to add
         this command to root's crontab, making use of the @reboot option.
         See crontab(5) for more information regarding this.

     * Configure syslogd(8) to create an extra log socket that named can
       write to. To do this, add -l /etc/namedb/dev/log to the syslogd_flags
       variable in /etc/rc.conf.

     * Arrange to have named start and chroot itself to the sandbox by adding
       the following to /etc/rc.conf:

 named_enable="YES"
 named_flags="-u bind -g bind -t /etc/namedb /etc/named.conf"

         Note: Note that the configuration file /etc/named.conf is denoted by
         a full pathname relative to the sandbox, i.e. in the line above, the
         file referred to is actually /etc/namedb/etc/named.conf.

   The next step is to edit /etc/namedb/etc/named.conf so that named knows
   which zones to load and where to find them on the disk. There follows a
   commented example (anything not specifically commented here is no
   different from the setup for a DNS server not running in a sandbox):

 options {
         directory "/";(1)
         named-xfer "/bin/named-xfer";(2)
         version "";             // Don't reveal BIND version
         query-source address * port 53;
 };
 // ndc control socket
 controls {
         unix "/var/run/ndc" perm 0600 owner 0 group 0;
 };
 // Zones follow:
 zone "localhost" IN {
         type master;
         file "master/named.localhost";(3)
         allow-transfer { localhost; };
         notify no;
 };
 zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" IN {
         type master;
         file "master/localhost.rev";
         allow-transfer { localhost; };
         notify no;
 };
 zone "0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.int" {
         type master;
         file "master/localhost-v6.rev";
         allow-transfer { localhost; };
         notify no;
 };
 zone "." IN {
         type hint;
         file "master/named.root";
 };
 zone "private.example.net" in {
         type master;
         file "master/private.example.net.db";
         allow-transfer { 192.168.10.0/24; };
 };
 zone "10.168.192.in-addr.arpa" in {
         type slave;
         masters { 192.168.10.2; };
         file "slave/192.168.10.db";(4)
 };

   (1)
           The directory statement is specified as /, since all files that
           named needs are within this directory (recall that this is
           equivalent to a ``normal'' user's /etc/namedb.
   (2)
           Specifies the full path to the named-xfer binary (from named's
           frame of reference). This is necessary since named is compiled to
           look for named-xfer in /usr/libexec by default.
   (3)
           Specifies the filename (relative to the directory statement above)
           where named can find the zonefile for this zone.
   (4)
           Specifies the filename (relative to the directory statement above)
           where named should write a copy of the zonefile for this zone
           after successfully transferring it from the master server. This is
           why we needed to change the ownership of the directory slave to
           bind in the setup stages above.

   After completing the steps above, either reboot your server or restart
   syslogd(8) and start named(8), making sure to use the new options
   specified in syslogd_flags and named_flags. You should now be running a
   sandboxed copy of named!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.11.9 Security

   Although BIND is the most common implementation of DNS, there is always
   the issue of security. Possible and exploitable security holes are
   sometimes found.

   It is a good idea to subscribe to CERT and freebsd-security-notifications
   to stay up to date with the current Internet and FreeBSD security issues.

     Tip: If a problem arises, keeping sources up to date and having a fresh
     build of named would not hurt.

19.12 NTP

   Contributed by Tom Hukins.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.1 Overview

   Over time, a computer's clock is prone to drift. As time passes, the
   computer's clock becomes less accurate. NTP (Network Time Protocol) is one
   way to ensure your clock is right.

   Many Internet services rely on, or greatly benefit from, computers' clocks
   being accurate. For example, a Web server may receive requests to send a
   file if it has modified since a certain time. Services such as cron(8) run
   commands at a given time. If the clock is inaccurate, these commands may
   not run when expected.

   DragonFly ships with the ntpd(8) NTP server which can be used to query
   other NTP servers to set the clock on your machine or provide time
   services to others.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.2 Choosing Appropriate NTP Servers

   In order to synchronize your clock, you will need to find one or more NTP
   servers to use. Your network administrator or ISP may have set up an NTP
   server for this purpose--check their documentation to see if this is the
   case. There is a list of publicly accessible NTP servers which you can use
   to find an NTP server near to you. Make sure you are aware of the policy
   for any servers you choose, and ask for permission if required.

   Choosing several unconnected NTP servers is a good idea in case one of the
   servers you are using becomes unreachable or its clock is unreliable.
   ntpd(8) uses the responses it receives from other servers
   intelligently--it will favor unreliable servers less than reliable ones.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.3 Configuring Your Machine

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.12.3.1 Basic Configuration

   If you only wish to synchronize your clock when the machine boots up, you
   can use ntpdate(8). This may be appropriate for some desktop machines
   which are frequently rebooted and only require infrequent synchronization,
   but most machines should run ntpd(8).

   Using ntpdate(8) at boot time is also a good idea for machines that run
   ntpd(8). The ntpd(8) program changes the clock gradually, whereas
   ntpdate(8) sets the clock, no matter how great the difference between a
   machine's current clock setting and the correct time.

   To enable ntpdate(8) at boot time, add ntpdate_enable="YES" to
   /etc/rc.conf. You will also need to specify all servers you wish to
   synchronize with and any flags to be passed to ntpdate(8) in
   ntpdate_flags.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.12.3.2 General Configuration

   NTP is configured by the /etc/ntp.conf file in the format described in
   ntp.conf(5). Here is a simple example:

 server ntplocal.example.com prefer
 server timeserver.example.org
 server ntp2a.example.net

 driftfile /var/db/ntp.drift

   The server option specifies which servers are to be used, with one server
   listed on each line. If a server is specified with the prefer argument, as
   with ntplocal.example.com, that server is preferred over other servers. A
   response from a preferred server will be discarded if it differs
   significantly from other servers' responses, otherwise it will be used
   without any consideration to other responses. The prefer argument is
   normally used for NTP servers that are known to be highly accurate, such
   as those with special time monitoring hardware.

   The driftfile option specifies which file is used to store the system
   clock's frequency offset. The ntpd(8) program uses this to automatically
   compensate for the clock's natural drift, allowing it to maintain a
   reasonably correct setting even if it is cut off from all external time
   sources for a period of time.

   The driftfile option specifies which file is used to store information
   about previous responses from the NTP servers you are using. This file
   contains internal information for NTP. It should not be modified by any
   other process.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    19.12.3.3 Controlling Access to Your Server

   By default, your NTP server will be accessible to all hosts on the
   Internet. The restrict option in /etc/ntp.conf allows you to control which
   machines can access your server.

   If you want to deny all machines from accessing your NTP server, add the
   following line to /etc/ntp.conf:

 restrict default ignore

   If you only want to allow machines within your own network to synchronize
   their clocks with your server, but ensure they are not allowed to
   configure the server or used as peers to synchronize against, add

 restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust nomodify notrap

   instead, where 192.168.1.0 is an IP address on your network and
   255.255.255.0 is your network's netmask.

   /etc/ntp.conf can contain multiple restrict options. For more details, see
   the Access Control Support subsection of ntp.conf(5).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.4 Running the NTP Server

   To ensure the NTP server is started at boot time, add the line
   xntpd_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf. If you wish to pass additional flags
   to ntpd(8), edit the xntpd_flags parameter in /etc/rc.conf.

   To start the server without rebooting your machine, run ntpd being sure to
   specify any additional parameters from xntpd_flags in /etc/rc.conf. For
   example:

 # ntpd -p /var/run/ntpd.pid

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.5 Using ntpd with a Temporary Internet Connection

   The ntpd(8) program does not need a permanent connection to the Internet
   to function properly. However, if you have a temporary connection that is
   configured to dial out on demand, it is a good idea to prevent NTP traffic
   from triggering a dial out or keeping the connection alive. If you are
   using user PPP, you can use filter directives in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf. For
   example:

  set filter dial 0 deny udp src eq 123
  # Prevent NTP traffic from initiating dial out
  set filter dial 1 permit 0 0
  set filter alive 0 deny udp src eq 123
  # Prevent incoming NTP traffic from keeping the connection open
  set filter alive 1 deny udp dst eq 123
  # Prevent outgoing NTP traffic from keeping the connection open
  set filter alive 2 permit 0/0 0/0

   For more details see the PACKET FILTERING section in ppp(8) and the
   examples in /usr/share/examples/ppp/.

     Note: Some Internet access providers block low-numbered ports,
     preventing NTP from functioning since replies never reach your machine.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.12.6 Further Information

   Documentation for the NTP server can be found in /usr/share/doc/ntp/ in
   HTML format.

19.13 Network Address Translation

   Contributed by Chern Lee.

  19.13.1 Overview

   DragonFly's Network Address Translation daemon, commonly known as natd(8)
   is a daemon that accepts incoming raw IP packets, changes the source to
   the local machine and re-injects these packets back into the outgoing IP
   packet stream. natd(8) does this by changing the source IP address and
   port such that when data is received back, it is able to determine the
   original location of the data and forward it back to its original
   requester.

   The most common use of NAT is to perform what is commonly known as
   Internet Connection Sharing.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.13.2 Setup

   Due to the diminishing IP space in IPv4, and the increased number of users
   on high-speed consumer lines such as cable or DSL, people are increasingly
   in need of an Internet Connection Sharing solution. The ability to connect
   several computers online through one connection and IP address makes
   natd(8) a reasonable choice.

   Most commonly, a user has a machine connected to a cable or DSL line with
   one IP address and wishes to use this one connected computer to provide
   Internet access to several more over a LAN.

   To do this, the DragonFly machine on the Internet must act as a gateway.
   This gateway machine must have two NICs--one for connecting to the
   Internet router, the other connecting to a LAN. All the machines on the
   LAN are connected through a hub or switch.

   _______       __________       ________
  |       |     |          |     |        |
  |  Hub  |-----| Client B |-----| Router |----- Internet
  |_______|     |__________|     |________|
      |
  ____|_____
 |          |
 | Client A |
 |__________|

   A setup like this is commonly used to share an Internet connection. One of
   the LAN machines is connected to the Internet. The rest of the machines
   access the Internet through that ``gateway'' machine.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.13.3 Configuration

   The following options must be in the kernel configuration file:

 options IPFIREWALL
 options IPDIVERT

   Additionally, at choice, the following may also be suitable:

 options IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT
 options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE

   The following must be in /etc/rc.conf:

 gateway_enable="YES"
 firewall_enable="YES"
 firewall_type="OPEN"
 natd_enable="YES"
 natd_interface="fxp0"
 natd_flags=""

                         Sets up the machine to act as a gateway. Running     
   gateway_enable="YES"  sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 would have the same  
                         effect.                                              
   firewall_enable="YES" Enables the firewall rules in /etc/rc.firewall at    
                         boot.                                                
                         This specifies a predefined firewall ruleset that    
   firewall_type="OPEN"  allows anything in. See /etc/rc.firewall for         
                         additional types.                                    
   natd_interface="fxp0" Indicates which interface to forward packets through 
                         (the interface connected to the Internet).           
   natd_flags=""         Any additional configuration options passed to       
                         natd(8) on boot.                                     

   Having the previous options defined in /etc/rc.conf would run natd
   -interface fxp0 at boot. This can also be run manually.

     Note: It is also possible to use a configuration file for natd(8) when
     there are too many options to pass. In this case, the configuration file
     must be defined by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

 natd_flags="-f /etc/natd.conf"

     The /etc/natd.conf file will contain a list of configuration options,
     one per line. For example the next section case would use the following
     file:

 redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
 redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80

     For more information about the configuration file, consult the natd(8)
     manual page about the -f option.

   Each machine and interface behind the LAN should be assigned IP address
   numbers in the private network space as defined by RFC 1918 and have a
   default gateway of the natd machine's internal IP address.

   For example, client A and B behind the LAN have IP addresses of
   192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.3, while the natd machine's LAN interface has an
   IP address of 192.168.0.1. Client A and B's default gateway must be set to
   that of the natd machine, 192.168.0.1. The natd machine's external, or
   Internet interface does not require any special modification for natd(8)
   to work.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.13.4 Port Redirection

   The drawback with natd(8) is that the LAN clients are not accessible from
   the Internet. Clients on the LAN can make outgoing connections to the
   world but cannot receive incoming ones. This presents a problem if trying
   to run Internet services on one of the LAN client machines. A simple way
   around this is to redirect selected Internet ports on the natd machine to
   a LAN client.

   For example, an IRC server runs on client A, and a web server runs on
   client B. For this to work properly, connections received on ports 6667
   (IRC) and 80 (web) must be redirected to the respective machines.

   The -redirect_port must be passed to natd(8) with the proper options. The
   syntax is as follows:

      -redirect_port proto targetIP:targetPORT[-targetPORT]
                  [aliasIP:]aliasPORT[-aliasPORT]
                  [remoteIP[:remotePORT[-remotePORT]]]

   In the above example, the argument should be:

     -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.2:6667 6667
     -redirect_port tcp 192.168.0.3:80 80

   This will redirect the proper tcp ports to the LAN client machines.

   The -redirect_port argument can be used to indicate port ranges over
   individual ports. For example, tcp 192.168.0.2:2000-3000 2000-3000 would
   redirect all connections received on ports 2000 to 3000 to ports 2000 to
   3000 on client A.

   These options can be used when directly running natd(8), placed within the
   natd_flags="" option in /etc/rc.conf, or passed via a configuration file.

   For further configuration options, consult natd(8)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.13.5 Address Redirection

   Address redirection is useful if several IP addresses are available, yet
   they must be on one machine. With this, natd(8) can assign each LAN client
   its own external IP address. natd(8) then rewrites outgoing packets from
   the LAN clients with the proper external IP address and redirects all
   traffic incoming on that particular IP address back to the specific LAN
   client. This is also known as static NAT. For example, the IP addresses
   128.1.1.1, 128.1.1.2, and 128.1.1.3 belong to the natd gateway machine.
   128.1.1.1 can be used as the natd gateway machine's external IP address,
   while 128.1.1.2 and 128.1.1.3 are forwarded back to LAN clients A and B.

   The -redirect_address syntax is as follows:

 -redirect_address localIP publicIP

   localIP  The internal IP address of the LAN client.               
   publicIP The external IP address corresponding to the LAN client. 

   In the example, this argument would read:

 -redirect_address 192.168.0.2 128.1.1.2
 -redirect_address 192.168.0.3 128.1.1.3

   Like -redirect_port, these arguments are also placed within the
   natd_flags="" option of /etc/rc.conf, or passed via a configuration file.
   With address redirection, there is no need for port redirection since all
   data received on a particular IP address is redirected.

   The external IP addresses on the natd machine must be active and aliased
   to the external interface. Look at rc.conf(5) to do so.

19.14 The inetd ``Super-Server''

   Contributed by Chern Lee.

  19.14.1 Overview

   inetd(8) is referred to as the ``Internet Super-Server'' because it
   manages connections for several daemons. Programs that provide network
   service are commonly known as daemons. inetd serves as a managing server
   for other daemons. When a connection is received by inetd, it determines
   which daemon the connection is destined for, spawns the particular daemon
   and delegates the socket to it. Running one instance of inetd reduces the
   overall system load as compared to running each daemon individually in
   stand-alone mode.

   Primarily, inetd is used to spawn other daemons, but several trivial
   protocols are handled directly, such as chargen, auth, and daytime.

   This section will cover the basics in configuring inetd through its
   command-line options and its configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.14.2 Settings

   inetd is initialized through the /etc/rc.conf system. The inetd_enable
   option is set to NO by default. Placing:

 inetd_enable="YES"

   or

 inetd_enable="NO"

   into /etc/rc.conf can enable or disable inetd starting at boot time.

   Additionally, different command-line options can be passed to inetd via
   the inetd_flags option.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.14.3 Command-Line Options

   inetd synopsis:

   inetd [-d] [-l] [-w] [-W] [-c maximum] [-C rate] [-a address | hostname]
   [-p filename] [-R rate] [configuration file]

   -d

           Turn on debugging.

   -l

           Turn on logging of successful connections.

   -w

           Turn on TCP Wrapping for external services (on by default).

   -W

           Turn on TCP Wrapping for internal services which are built into
           inetd (on by default).

   -c maximum

           Specify the default maximum number of simultaneous invocations of
           each service; the default is unlimited. May be overridden on a
           per-service basis with the max-child parameter.

   -C rate

           Specify the default maximum number of times a service can be
           invoked from a single IP address in one minute; the default is
           unlimited. May be overridden on a per-service basis with the
           max-connections-per-ip-per-minute parameter.

   -R rate

           Specify the maximum number of times a service can be invoked in
           one minute; the default is 256. A rate of 0 allows an unlimited
           number of invocations.

   -a

           Specify one specific IP address to bind to. Alternatively, a
           hostname can be specified, in which case the IPv4 or IPv6 address
           which corresponds to that hostname is used. Usually a hostname is
           specified when inetd is run inside a jail(8), in which case the
           hostname corresponds to the jail(8) environment.

           When hostname specification is used and both IPv4 and IPv6
           bindings are desired, one entry with the appropriate protocol type
           for each binding is required for each service in /etc/inetd.conf.
           For example, a TCP-based service would need two entries, one using
           tcp4 for the protocol and the other using tcp6.

   -p

           Specify an alternate file in which to store the process ID.

   These options can be passed to inetd using the inetd_flags option in
   /etc/rc.conf. By default, inetd_flags is set to -wW, which turns on TCP
   wrapping for inetd's internal and external services. For novice users,
   these parameters usually do not need to be modified or even entered in
   /etc/rc.conf.

     Note: An external service is a daemon outside of inetd, which is invoked
     when a connection is received for it. On the other hand, an internal
     service is one that inetd has the facility of offering within itself.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.14.4 inetd.conf

   Configuration of inetd is controlled through the /etc/inetd.conf file.

   When a modification is made to /etc/inetd.conf, inetd can be forced to
   re-read its configuration file by sending a HangUP signal to the inetd
   process as shown:

   Example 19-4. Sending inetd a HangUP Signal

 # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`

   Each line of the configuration file specifies an individual daemon.
   Comments in the file are preceded by a ``#''. The format of
   /etc/inetd.conf is as follows:

 service-name
 socket-type
 protocol
 {wait|nowait}[/max-child[/max-connections-per-ip-per-minute]]
 user[:group][/login-class]
 server-program
 server-program-arguments

   An example entry for the ftpd daemon using IPv4:

 ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/ftpd       ftpd -l

   service-name

           This is the service name of the particular daemon. It must
           correspond to a service listed in /etc/services. This determines
           which port inetd must listen to. If a new service is being
           created, it must be placed in /etc/services first.

   socket-type

           Either stream, dgram, raw, or seqpacket. stream must be used for
           connection-based, TCP daemons, while dgram is used for daemons
           utilizing the UDP transport protocol.

   protocol

           One of the following:

           +----------------------------------+
           | Protocol  |     Explanation      |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | tcp, tcp4 | TCP IPv4             |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | udp, udp4 | UDP IPv4             |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | tcp6      | TCP IPv6             |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | udp6      | UDP IPv6             |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | tcp46     | Both TCP IPv4 and v6 |
           |-----------+----------------------|
           | udp46     | Both UDP IPv4 and v6 |
           +----------------------------------+

   {wait|nowait}[/max-child[/max-connections-per-ip-per-minute]]

           wait|nowait indicates whether the daemon invoked from inetd is
           able to handle its own socket or not. dgram socket types must use
           the wait option, while stream socket daemons, which are usually
           multi-threaded, should use nowait. wait usually hands off multiple
           sockets to a single daemon, while nowait spawns a child daemon for
           each new socket.

           The maximum number of child daemons inetd may spawn can be set
           using the max-child option. If a limit of ten instances of a
           particular daemon is needed, a /10 would be placed after nowait.

           In addition to max-child, another option limiting the maximum
           connections from a single place to a particular daemon can be
           enabled. max-connections-per-ip-per-minute does just this. A value
           of ten here would limit any particular IP address connecting to a
           particular service to ten attempts per minute. This is useful to
           prevent intentional or unintentional resource consumption and
           Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to a machine.

           In this field, wait or nowait is mandatory. max-child and
           max-connections-per-ip-per-minute are optional.

           A stream-type multi-threaded daemon without any max-child or
           max-connections-per-ip-per-minute limits would simply be: nowait.

           The same daemon with a maximum limit of ten daemons would read:
           nowait/10.

           Additionally, the same setup with a limit of twenty connections
           per IP address per minute and a maximum total limit of ten child
           daemons would read: nowait/10/20.

           These options are all utilized by the default settings of the
           fingerd daemon, as seen here:

 finger stream  tcp     nowait/3/10 nobody /usr/libexec/fingerd fingerd -s

   user

           This is the username that the particular daemon should run as.
           Most commonly, daemons run as the root user. For security
           purposes, it is common to find some servers running as the daemon
           user, or the least privileged nobody user.

   server-program

           The full path of the daemon to be executed when a connection is
           received. If the daemon is a service provided by inetd internally,
           then internal should be used.

   server-program-arguments

           This works in conjunction with server-program by specifying the
           arguments, starting with argv[0], passed to the daemon on
           invocation. If mydaemon -d is the command line, mydaemon -d would
           be the value of server-program-arguments. Again, if the daemon is
           an internal service, use internal here.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.14.5 Security

   Depending on the security profile chosen at install, many of inetd's
   daemons may be enabled by default. If there is no apparent need for a
   particular daemon, disable it! Place a ``#'' in front of the daemon in
   question, and send a hangup signal to inetd. Some daemons, such as
   fingerd, may not be desired at all because they provide an attacker with
   too much information.

   Some daemons are not security-conscious and have long, or non-existent
   timeouts for connection attempts. This allows an attacker to slowly send
   connections to a particular daemon, thus saturating available resources.
   It may be a good idea to place max-connections-per-ip-per-minute and
   max-child limitations on certain daemons.

   By default, TCP wrapping is turned on. Consult the hosts_access(5) manual
   page for more information on placing TCP restrictions on various inetd
   invoked daemons.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.14.6 Miscellaneous

   daytime, time, echo, discard, chargen, and auth are all internally
   provided services of inetd.

   The auth service provides identity (ident, identd) network services, and
   is configurable to a certain degree.

   Consult the inetd(8) manual page for more in-depth information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

19.15 Parallel Line IP (PLIP)

   PLIP lets us run TCP/IP between parallel ports. It is useful on machines
   without network cards, or to install on laptops. In this section, we will
   discuss:

     * Creating a parallel (laplink) cable.

     * Connecting two computers with PLIP.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.15.1 Creating a Parallel Cable

   You can purchase a parallel cable at most computer supply stores. If you
   cannot do that, or you just want to know how it is done, the following
   table shows how to make one out of a normal parallel printer cable.

   Table 19-1. Wiring a Parallel Cable for Networking

   +--------------------------------------------+
   | A-name | A-End | B-End | Descr. | Post/Bit |

   |--------+-------+-------+--------+----------|
   | GND    | 18-25 | 18-25 | GND    | -        |
   +--------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.15.2 Setting Up PLIP

   First, you have to get a laplink cable. Then, confirm that both computers
   have a kernel with lpt(4) driver support:

 # grep lp /var/run/dmesg.boot
 lpt0: <Printer> on ppbus0
 lpt0: Interrupt-driven port

   The parallel port must be an interrupt driven port. You should have a line
   similar to the following in your kernel configuration file:

 device ppc0 at isa? irq 7

   Then check if the kernel configuration file has a device plip line or if
   the plip.ko kernel module is loaded. In both cases the parallel networking
   interface should appear when you directly use the ifconfig(8) command.

 # ifconfig lp0
 lp0: flags=8810<POINTOPOINT,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500

   Plug in the laplink cable into the parallel interface on both computers.

   Configure the network interface parameters on both sites as root. For
   example, if you want connect the host host1 with host2:

                  host1 <-----> host2
 IP Address    10.0.0.1      10.0.0.2

   Configure the interface on host1 by doing:

 # ifconfig lp0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2

   Configure the interface on host2 by doing:

 # ifconfig lp0 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.1

   You now should have a working connection. Please read the manual pages
   lp(4) and lpt(4) for more details.

   You should also add both hosts to /etc/hosts:

 127.0.0.1               localhost.my.domain localhost
 10.0.0.1                host1.my.domain host1
 10.0.0.2                host2.my.domain

   To confirm the connection works, go to each host and ping the other. For
   example, on host1:

 # ifconfig lp0
 lp0: flags=8851<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
         inet 10.0.0.1 --> 10.0.0.2 netmask 0xff000000
 # netstat -r
 Routing tables

 Internet:
 Destination        Gateway          Flags     Refs     Use      Netif Expire
 host2              host1              UH          0       0       lp0

19.16 IPv6

   Originally Written by Aaron Kaplan. Restructured and Added by Tom Rhodes.

   IPv6 (also know as IPng ``IP next generation'') is the new version of the
   well known IP protocol (also know as IPv4). Like the other current *BSD
   systems, DragonFly includes the KAME IPv6 reference implementation. So
   your DragonFly system comes with all you will need to experiment with
   IPv6. This section focuses on getting IPv6 configured and running.

   In the early 1990s, people became aware of the rapidly diminishing address
   space of IPv4. Given the expansion rate of the Internet there were two
   major concerns:

     * Running out of addresses. Today this is not so much of a concern
       anymore since private address spaces (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/24,
       etc.) and Network Address Translation (NAT) are being employed.

     * Router table entries were getting too large. This is still a concern
       today.

   IPv6 deals with these and many other issues:

     * 128 bit address space. In other words theoretically there are
       340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses
       available. This means there are approximately 6.67 * 10^27 IPv6
       addresses per square meter on our planet.

     * Routers will only store network aggregation addresses in their routing
       tables thus reducing the average space of a routing table to 8192
       entries.

   There are also lots of other useful features of IPv6 such as:

     * Address autoconfiguration (RFC2462)

     * Anycast addresses (``one-out-of many'')

     * Mandatory multicast addresses

     * IPsec (IP security)

     * Simplified header structure

     * Mobile IP

     * IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanisms

   For more information see:

     * IPv6 overview at playground.sun.com

     * KAME.net

     * 6bone.net

  19.16.1 Background on IPv6 Addresses

   There are different types of IPv6 addresses: Unicast, Anycast and
   Multicast.

   Unicast addresses are the well known addresses. A packet sent to a unicast
   address arrives exactly at the interface belonging to the address.

   Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast
   addresses but they address a group of interfaces. The packet destined for
   an anycast address will arrive at the nearest (in router metric)
   interface. Anycast addresses may only be used by routers.

   Multicast addresses identify a group of interfaces. A packet destined for
   a multicast address will arrive at all interfaces belonging to the
   multicast group.

     Note: The IPv4 broadcast address (usually xxx.xxx.xxx.255) is expressed
     by multicast addresses in IPv6.

   Table 19-2. Reserved IPv6 addresses

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.16.2 Reading IPv6 Addresses

   The canonical form is represented as: x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, each ``x'' being a
   16 Bit hex value. For example FEBC:A574:382B:23C1:AA49:4592:4EFE:9982

   Often an address will have long substrings of all zeros therefore each
   such substring can be abbreviated by ``::''. For example fe80::1
   corresponds to the canonical form fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001.

   A third form is to write the last 32 Bit part in the well known (decimal)
   IPv4 style with dots ``.'' as separators. For example 2002::10.0.0.1
   corresponds to the (hexadecimal) canonical representation
   2002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0a00:0001 which in turn is equivalent to
   writing 2002::a00:1.

   By now the reader should be able to understand the following:

 # ifconfig

 rl0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
          inet 10.0.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
          inet6 fe80::200:21ff:fe03:8e1%rl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
          ether 00:00:21:03:08:e1
          media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX )
          status: active

   fe80::200:21ff:fe03:8e1%rl0 is an auto configured link-local address. It
   includes the scrambled Ethernet MAC as part of the auto configuration.

   For further information on the structure of IPv6 addresses see RFC3513.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.16.3 Getting Connected

   Currently there are four ways to connect to other IPv6 hosts and networks:

     * Join the experimental 6bone

     * Getting an IPv6 network from your upstream provider. Talk to your
       Internet provider for instructions.

     * Tunnel via 6-to-4

     * Use the net/freenet6 port if you are on a dial-up connection.

   Here we will talk on how to connect to the 6bone since it currently seems
   to be the most popular way.

   First take a look at the 6bone site and find a 6bone connection nearest to
   you. Write to the responsible person and with a little bit of luck you
   will be given instructions on how to set up your connection. Usually this
   involves setting up a GRE (gif) tunnel.

   Here is a typical example on setting up a gif(4) tunnel:

 # ifconfig gif0 create
 # ifconfig gif0
 gif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280
 # ifconfig gif0 tunnel MY_IPv4_ADDR  HIS_IPv4_ADDR
 # ifconfig gif0 inet6 alias MY_ASSIGNED_IPv6_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT_ADDR

   Replace the capitalized words by the information you received from the
   upstream 6bone node.

   This establishes the tunnel. Check if the tunnel is working by ping6(8)
   'ing ff02::1%gif0. You should receive two ping replies.

     Note: In case you are intrigued by the address ff02:1%gif0, this is a
     multicast address. %gif0 states that the multicast address at network
     interface gif0 is to be used. Since we ping a multicast address the
     other endpoint of the tunnel should reply as well.

   By now setting up a route to your 6bone uplink should be rather
   straightforward:

 # route add -inet6 default -interface gif0
 # ping6 -n MY_UPLINK

 # traceroute6 www.jp.FreeBSD.org
 (3ffe:505:2008:1:2a0:24ff:fe57:e561) from 3ffe:8060:100::40:2, 30 hops max, 12 byte packets
      1  atnet-meta6  14.147 ms  15.499 ms  24.319 ms
      2  6bone-gw2-ATNET-NT.ipv6.tilab.com  103.408 ms  95.072 ms *
      3  3ffe:1831:0:ffff::4  138.645 ms  134.437 ms  144.257 ms
      4  3ffe:1810:0:6:290:27ff:fe79:7677  282.975 ms  278.666 ms  292.811 ms
      5  3ffe:1800:0:ff00::4  400.131 ms  396.324 ms  394.769 ms
      6  3ffe:1800:0:3:290:27ff:fe14:cdee  394.712 ms  397.19 ms  394.102 ms

   This output will differ from machine to machine. By now you should be able
   to reach the IPv6 site www.kame.net and see the dancing tortoise -- that
   is if you have a IPv6 enabled browser such as www/mozilla.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  19.16.4 DNS in the IPv6 World

   There are two new types of DNS records for IPv6:

     * AAAA records,

     * A6 records

   Using AAAA records is straightforward. Assign your hostname to the new
   IPv6 address you just got by adding:

 MYHOSTNAME           AAAA    MYIPv6ADDR

   To your primary zone DNS file. In case you do not serve your own DNS zones
   ask your DNS provider. Current versions of bind (version 8.3 and 9)
   support AAAA records.

20.1 Synopsis

   ``Electronic Mail'', better known as email, is one of the most widely used
   forms of communication today. This chapter provides a basic introduction
   to running a mail server on DragonFly, as well as an introduction to
   sending and receiving email using DragonFly; however, it is not a complete
   reference and in fact many important considerations are omitted. For more
   complete coverage of the subject, the reader is referred to the many
   excellent books listed in Appendix B.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * What software components are involved in sending and receiving
       electronic mail.

     * Where basic sendmail configuration files are located in DragonFly.

     * The difference between remote and local mailboxes.

     * How to block spammers from illegally using your mail server as a
       relay.

     * How to install and configure an alternate Mail Transfer Agent on your
       system, replacing sendmail.

     * How to troubleshoot common mail server problems.

     * How to use SMTP with UUCP.

     * How to set up the system to send mail only.

     * How to use mail with a dialup connection.

     * How to configure SMTP Authentication for added security.

     * How to install and use a Mail User Agent, such as mutt to send and
       receive email.

     * How to download your mail from a remote POP or IMAP server.

     * How to automatically apply filters and rules to incoming email.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Properly set up your network connection (Chapter 19).

     * Properly set up the DNS information for your mail host (Chapter 19).

     * Know how to install additional third-party software (Chapter 4).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.2 Using Electronic Mail

   There are five major parts involved in an email exchange. They are: the
   user program, the server daemon, DNS, a remote or local mailbox, and of
   course, the mailhost itself.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.2.1 The User Program

   This includes command line programs such as mutt, pine, elm, and mail, and
   GUI programs such as balsa, xfmail to name a few, and something more
   ``sophisticated'' like a WWW browser. These programs simply pass off the
   email transactions to the local ``mailhost'', either by calling one of the
   server daemons available, or delivering it over TCP.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.2.2 Mailhost Server Daemon

   DragonFly ships with sendmail by default, but also support numerous other
   mail server daemons, just some of which include:

     * exim;

     * postfix;

     * qmail.

   The server daemon usually has two functions--it is responsible for
   receiving incoming mail as well as delivering outgoing mail. It is not
   responsible for the collection of mail using protocols such as POP or IMAP
   to read your email, nor does it allow connecting to local mbox or Maildir
   mailboxes. You may require an additional daemon for that.

     Warning: Older versions of sendmail have some serious security issues
     which may result in an attacker gaining local and/or remote access to
     your machine. Make sure that you are running a current version to avoid
     these problems. Optionally, install an alternative MTA from the
     DragonFly Pkgsrc Collection.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.2.3 Email and DNS

   The Domain Name System (DNS) and its daemon named play a large role in the
   delivery of email. In order to deliver mail from your site to another, the
   server daemon will look up the remote site in the DNS to determine the
   host that will receive mail for the destination. This process also occurs
   when mail is sent from a remote host to your mail server.

   DNS is responsible for mapping hostnames to IP addresses, as well as for
   storing information specific to mail delivery, known as MX records. The MX
   (Mail eXchanger) record specifies which host, or hosts, will receive mail
   for a particular domain. If you do not have an MX record for your hostname
   or domain, the mail will be delivered directly to your host provided you
   have an A record pointing your hostname to your IP address.

   You may view the MX records for any domain by using the host(1) command,
   as seen in the example below:

 % host -t mx DragonflyBSD.org
 DragonflyBSD.org mail is handled (pri=10) by crater.dragonflybsd.org

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.2.4 Receiving Mail

   Receiving mail for your domain is done by the mail host. It will collect
   all mail sent to your domain and store it either in mbox (the default
   method for storing mail) or Maildir format, depending on your
   configuration. Once mail has been stored, it may either be read locally
   using applications such as mail(1) or mutt, or remotely accessed and
   collected using protocols such as POP or IMAP. This means that should you
   only wish to read mail locally, you are not required to install a POP or
   IMAP server.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    20.2.4.1 Accessing remote mailboxes using POP and IMAP

   In order to access mailboxes remotely, you are required to have access to
   a POP or IMAP server. These protocols allow users to connect to their
   mailboxes from remote locations with ease. Though both POP and IMAP allow
   users to remotely access mailboxes, IMAP offers many advantages, some of
   which are:

     * IMAP can store messages on a remote server as well as fetch them.

     * IMAP supports concurrent updates.

     * IMAP can be extremely useful over low-speed links as it allows users
       to fetch the structure of messages without downloading them; it can
       also perform tasks such as searching on the server in order to
       minimize data transfer between clients and servers.

   In order to install a POP or IMAP server, the following steps should be
   performed:

    1. Choose an IMAP or POP server that best suits your needs. The following
       POP and IMAP servers are well known and serve as some good examples:

          * qpopper;

          * teapop;

          * imap-uw;

          * courier-imap;

    2. Install the POP or IMAP daemon of your choosing from the ports
       collection.

    3. Where required, modify /etc/inetd.conf to load the POP or IMAP server.

     Warning: It should be noted that both POP and IMAP transmit information,
     including username and password credentials in clear-text. This means
     that if you wish to secure the transmission of information across these
     protocols, you should consider tunneling sessions over ssh(1). Tunneling
     sessions is described in Section 10.10.7.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    20.2.4.2 Accessing local mailboxes

   Mailboxes may be accessed locally by directly utilizing MUAs on the server
   on which the mailbox resides. This can be done using applications such as
   mutt or mail(1).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.2.5 The Mail Host

   The mail host is the name given to a server that is responsible for
   delivering and receiving mail for your host, and possibly your network.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.3 sendmail Configuration

   Contributed by Christopher Shumway.

   sendmail(8) is the default Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) in DragonFly.
   sendmail's job is to accept mail from Mail User Agents (MUA) and deliver
   it to the appropriate mailer as defined by its configuration file.
   sendmail can also accept network connections and deliver mail to local
   mailboxes or deliver it to another program.

   sendmail uses the following configuration files:

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |          Filename          |                 Function                 |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/access           | sendmail access database file            |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/aliases          | Mailbox aliases                          |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/local-host-names | Lists of hosts sendmail accepts mail for |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/mailer.conf      | Mailer program configuration             |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/mailertable      | Mailer delivery table                    |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/sendmail.cf      | sendmail master configuration file       |
   |----------------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/mail/virtusertable    | Virtual users and domain tables          |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.3.1 /etc/mail/access

   The access database defines what host(s) or IP addresses have access to
   the local mail server and what kind of access they have. Hosts can be
   listed as OK, REJECT, RELAY or simply passed to sendmail's error handling
   routine with a given mailer error. Hosts that are listed as OK, which is
   the default, are allowed to send mail to this host as long as the mail's
   final destination is the local machine. Hosts that are listed as REJECT
   are rejected for all mail connections. Hosts that have the RELAY option
   for their hostname are allowed to send mail for any destination through
   this mail server.

   Example 20-1. Configuring the sendmail Access Database

 cyberspammer.com                550 We don't accept mail from spammers
 FREE.STEALTH.MAILER@            550 We don't accept mail from spammers
 another.source.of.spam          REJECT
 okay.cyberspammer.com           OK
 128.32                          RELAY

   In this example we have five entries. Mail senders that match the left
   hand side of the table are affected by the action on the right side of the
   table. The first two examples give an error code to sendmail's error
   handling routine. The message is printed to the remote host when a mail
   matches the left hand side of the table. The next entry rejects mail from
   a specific host on the Internet, another.source.of.spam. The next entry
   accepts mail connections from a host okay.cyberspammer.com, which is more
   exact than the cyberspammer.com line above. More specific matches override
   less exact matches. The last entry allows relaying of electronic mail from
   hosts with an IP address that begins with 128.32. These hosts would be
   able to send mail through this mail server that are destined for other
   mail servers.

   When this file is updated, you need to run make in /etc/mail/ to update
   the database.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.3.2 /etc/mail/aliases

   The aliases database contains a list of virtual mailboxes that are
   expanded to other user(s), files, programs or other aliases. Here are a
   few examples that can be used in /etc/mail/aliases:

   Example 20-2. Mail Aliases

 root: localuser
 ftp-bugs: joe,eric,paul
 bit.bucket:  /dev/null
 procmail: "|/usr/local/bin/procmail"

   The file format is simple; the mailbox name on the left side of the colon
   is expanded to the target(s) on the right. The first example simply
   expands the mailbox root to the mailbox localuser, which is then looked up
   again in the aliases database. If no match is found, then the message is
   delivered to the local user localuser. The next example shows a mail list.
   Mail to the mailbox ftp-bugs is expanded to the three local mailboxes joe,
   eric, and paul. Note that a remote mailbox could be specified as
   user@example.com. The next example shows writing mail to a file, in this
   case /dev/null. The last example shows sending mail to a program, in this
   case the mail message is written to the standard input of
   /usr/local/bin/procmail through a UNIX pipe.

   When this file is updated, you need to run make in /etc/mail/ to update
   the database.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.3.3 /etc/mail/local-host-names

   This is a list of hostnames sendmail(8) is to accept as the local host
   name. Place any domains or hosts that sendmail is to be receiving mail
   for. For example, if this mail server was to accept mail for the domain
   example.com and the host mail.example.com, its local-host-names might look
   something like this:

 example.com
 mail.example.com

   When this file is updated, sendmail(8) needs to be restarted to read the
   changes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.3.4 /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

   sendmail's master configuration file, sendmail.cf controls the overall
   behavior of sendmail, including everything from rewriting e-mail addresses
   to printing rejection messages to remote mail servers. Naturally, with
   such a diverse role, this configuration file is quite complex and its
   details are a bit out of the scope of this section. Fortunately, this file
   rarely needs to be changed for standard mail servers.

   The master sendmail configuration file can be built from m4(1) macros that
   define the features and behavior of sendmail. Please see
   /usr/src/contrib/sendmail/cf/README for some of the details.

   When changes to this file are made, sendmail needs to be restarted for the
   changes to take effect.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.3.5 /etc/mail/virtusertable

   The virtusertable maps mail addresses for virtual domains and mailboxes to
   real mailboxes. These mailboxes can be local, remote, aliases defined in
   /etc/mail/aliases or files.

   Example 20-3. Example Virtual Domain Mail Map

 root@example.com                root
 postmaster@example.com          postmaster@noc.example.net
 @example.com                    joe

   In the above example, we have a mapping for a domain example.com. This
   file is processed in a first match order down the file. The first item
   maps root@example.com to the local mailbox root. The next entry maps
   postmaster@example.com to the mailbox postmaster on the host
   noc.example.net. Finally, if nothing from example.com has matched so far,
   it will match the last mapping, which matches every other mail message
   addressed to someone at example.com. This will be mapped to the local
   mailbox joe.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.4 Changing Your Mail Transfer Agent

   Written by Andrew Boothman. Information taken from e-mails written by
   Gregory Neil Shapiro.

   As already mentioned, DragonFly comes with sendmail already installed as
   your MTA (Mail Transfer Agent). Therefore by default it is in charge of
   your outgoing and incoming mail.

   However, for a variety of reasons, some system administrators want to
   change their system's MTA. These reasons range from simply wanting to try
   out another MTA to needing a specific feature or package which relies on
   another mailer. Fortunately, whatever the reason, DragonFly makes it easy
   to make the change.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.4.1 Install a New MTA

   You have a wide choice of MTAs available. A good starting point is the
   pkgsrc collectionor where you will be able to find many. Of course you are
   free to use any MTA you want from any location, as long as you can make it
   run under DragonFly.

   Start by installing your new MTA. Once it is installed it gives you a
   chance to decide if it really fulfills your needs, and also gives you the
   opportunity to configure your new software before getting it to take over
   from sendmail. When doing this, you should be sure that installing the new
   software will not attempt to overwrite system binaries such as
   /usr/bin/sendmail. Otherwise, your new mail software has essentially been
   put into service before you have configured it.

   Please refer to your chosen MTA's documentation for information on how to
   configure the software you have chosen.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.4.2 Disable sendmail

   In order to completely disable sendmail you must use

 sendmail_enable="NONE"

   in /etc/rc.conf.

     Warning: If you disable sendmail's outgoing mail service in this way, it
     is important that you replace it with a fully working alternative mail
     delivery system. If you choose not to, system functions such as
     periodic(8) will be unable to deliver their results by e-mail as they
     would normally expect to. Many parts of your system may expect to have a
     functional sendmail-compatible system. If applications continue to use
     sendmail's binaries to try to send e-mail after you have disabled them,
     mail could go into an inactive sendmail queue, and never be delivered.

   If you only want to disable sendmail's incoming mail service, you should
   set

 sendmail_enable="NO"

   in /etc/rc.conf. More information on sendmail's startup options is
   available from the rc.sendmail(8) manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.4.3 Running Your New MTA on Boot

   You may have a choice of two methods for running your new MTA on boot,
   again depending on what version of DragonFly you are running.

   With later versions of DragonFly, you can use the above method or you can
   set

 mta_start_script="filename"

   in /etc/rc.conf, where filename is the name of some script that you want
   executed at boot to start your MTA.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.4.4 Replacing sendmail as the System's Default Mailer

   The program sendmail is so ubiquitous as standard software on UNIX systems
   that some software just assumes it is already installed and configured.
   For this reason, many alternative MTA's provide their own compatible
   implementations of the sendmail command-line interface; this facilitates
   using them as ``drop-in'' replacements for sendmail.

   Therefore, if you are using an alternative mailer, you will need to make
   sure that software trying to execute standard sendmail binaries such as
   /usr/bin/sendmail actually executes your chosen mailer instead.
   Fortunately, DragonFly provides a system called mailwrapper(8) that does
   this job for you.

   When sendmail is operating as installed, you will find something like the
   following in /etc/mail/mailer.conf:

 sendmail         /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
 send-mail       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
 mailq           /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
 newaliases      /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
 hoststat        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
 purgestat       /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

   This means that when any of these common commands (such as sendmail
   itself) are run, the system actually invokes a copy of mailwrapper named
   sendmail, which checks mailer.conf and executes
   /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail instead. This system makes it easy to
   change what binaries are actually executed when these default sendmail
   functions are invoked.

   Therefore if you wanted /usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat to be
   run instead of sendmail, you could change /etc/mail/mailer.conf to read:

 sendmail         /usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat
 send-mail       /usr/local/supermailer/bin/sendmail-compat
 mailq           /usr/local/supermailer/bin/mailq-compat
 newaliases      /usr/local/supermailer/bin/newaliases-compat
 hoststat        /usr/local/supermailer/bin/hoststat-compat
 purgestat       /usr/local/supermailer/bin/purgestat-compat

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.4.5 Finishing

   Once you have everything configured the way you want it, you should either
   kill the sendmail processes that you no longer need and start the
   processes belonging to your new software, or simply reboot. Rebooting will
   also give you the opportunity to ensure that you have correctly configured
   your system to start your new MTA automatically on boot.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.5 Troubleshooting

   20.5.1. Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?

   20.5.2. sendmail says ``mail loops back to myself''

   20.5.3. How can I run a mail server on a dial-up PPP host?

   20.5.4. Why do I keep getting ``Relaying Denied'' errors when sending mail
   from other hosts?

   20.5.1. Why do I have to use the FQDN for hosts on my site?

   You will probably find that the host is actually in a different domain;
   for example, if you are in foo.bar.edu and you wish to reach a host called
   mumble in the bar.edu domain, you will have to refer to it by the
   fully-qualified domain name, mumble.bar.edu, instead of just mumble.

   Traditionally, this was allowed by BSD BIND resolvers. However the current
   version of BIND that ships with DragonFly no longer provides default
   abbreviations for non-fully qualified domain names other than the domain
   you are in. So an unqualified host mumble must either be found as
   mumble.foo.bar.edu, or it will be searched for in the root domain.

   This is different from the previous behavior, where the search continued
   across mumble.bar.edu, and mumble.edu. Have a look at RFC 1535 for why
   this was considered bad practice, or even a security hole.

   As a good workaround, you can place the line:

 search foo.bar.edu bar.edu

   instead of the previous:

 domain foo.bar.edu

   into your /etc/resolv.conf. However, make sure that the search order does
   not go beyond the ``boundary between local and public administration'', as
   RFC 1535 calls it.

   20.5.2. sendmail says ``mail loops back to myself''

   This is answered in the sendmail FAQ as follows:

 I'm getting these error messages:

 553 MX list for domain.net points back to relay.domain.net
 554 <user@domain.net>... Local configuration error

 How can I solve this problem?

 You have asked mail to the domain (e.g., domain.net) to be
 forwarded to a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net)
 by using an MX record, but the relay machine does not recognize
 itself as domain.net. Add domain.net to /etc/mail/local-host-names
 [known as /etc/sendmail.cw prior to version 8.10]
 (if you are using FEATURE(use_cw_file)) or add ``Cw domain.net''
 to /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.

   The sendmail FAQ can be found at http://www.sendmail.org/faq/ and is
   recommended reading if you want to do any ``tweaking'' of your mail setup.

   20.5.3. How can I run a mail server on a dial-up PPP host?

   You want to connect a DragonFly box on a LAN to the Internet. The
   DragonFly box will be a mail gateway for the LAN. The PPP connection is
   non-dedicated.

   There are at least two ways to do this. One way is to use UUCP.

   Another way is to get a full-time Internet server to provide secondary MX
   services for your domain. For example, if your company's domain is
   example.com and your Internet service provider has set example.net up to
   provide secondary MX services to your domain:

 example.com.          MX        10      example.com.
                       MX        20      example.net.

   Only one host should be specified as the final recipient (add Cw
   example.com in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf on example.com).

   When the sending sendmail is trying to deliver the mail it will try to
   connect to you (example.com) over the modem link. It will most likely time
   out because you are not online. The program sendmail will automatically
   deliver it to the secondary MX site, i.e. your Internet provider
   (example.net). The secondary MX site will then periodically try to connect
   to your host and deliver the mail to the primary MX host (example.com).

   You might want to use something like this as a login script:

 #!/bin/sh
 # Put me in /usr/local/bin/pppmyisp
 ( sleep 60 ; /usr/sbin/sendmail -q ) &
 /usr/sbin/ppp -direct pppmyisp

   If you are going to create a separate login script for a user you could
   use sendmail -qRexample.com instead in the script above. This will force
   all mail in your queue for example.com to be processed immediately.

   A further refinement of the situation is as follows:

   Message stolen from the FreeBSD Internet service provider's mailing list.

 > we provide the secondary MX for a customer. The customer connects to
 > our services several times a day automatically to get the mails to
 > his primary MX (We do not call his site when a mail for his domains
 > arrived). Our sendmail sends the mailqueue every 30 minutes. At the
 > moment he has to stay 30 minutes online to be sure that all mail is
 > gone to the primary MX.
 >
 > Is there a command that would initiate sendmail to send all the mails
 > now? The user has not root-privileges on our machine of course.

 In the ``privacy flags'' section of sendmail.cf, there is a
 definition Opgoaway,restrictqrun

 Remove restrictqrun to allow non-root users to start the queue processing.
 You might also like to rearrange the MXs. We are the 1st MX for our
 customers like this, and we have defined:

 # If we are the best MX for a host, try directly instead of generating
 # local config error.
 OwTrue

 That way a remote site will deliver straight to you, without trying
 the customer connection.  You then send to your customer.  Only works for
 ``hosts'', so you need to get your customer to name their mail
 machine ``customer.com'' as well as
 ``hostname.customer.com'' in the DNS.  Just put an A record in
 the DNS for ``customer.com''.

   20.5.4. Why do I keep getting ``Relaying Denied'' errors when sending mail
   from other hosts?

   In default DragonFly installations, sendmail is configured to only send
   mail from the host it is running on. For example, if a POP server is
   available, then users will be able to check mail from school, work, or
   other remote locations but they still will not be able to send outgoing
   emails from outside locations. Typically, a few moments after the attempt,
   an email will be sent from MAILER-DAEMON with a ``5.7 Relaying Denied''
   error message.

   There are several ways to get around this. The most straightforward
   solution is to put your ISP's address in a relay-domains file at
   /etc/mail/relay-domains. A quick way to do this would be:

 # echo "your.isp.example.com" > /etc/mail/relay-domains

   After creating or editing this file you must restart sendmail. This works
   great if you are a server administrator and do not wish to send mail
   locally, or would like to use a point and click client/system on another
   machine or even another ISP. It is also very useful if you only have one
   or two email accounts set up. If there is a large number of addresses to
   add, you can simply open this file in your favorite text editor and then
   add the domains, one per line:

 your.isp.example.com
 other.isp.example.net
 users-isp.example.org
 www.example.org

   Now any mail sent through your system, by any host in this list (provided
   the user has an account on your system), will succeed. This is a very nice
   way to allow users to send mail from your system remotely without allowing
   people to send SPAM through your system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.6 Advanced Topics

   The following section covers more involved topics such as mail
   configuration and setting up mail for your entire domain.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.6.1 Basic Configuration

   Out of the box, you should be able to send email to external hosts as long
   as you have set up /etc/resolv.conf or are running your own name server.
   If you would like to have mail for your host delivered to the MTA (e.g.,
   sendmail) on your own DragonFly host, there are two methods:

     * Run your own name server and have your own domain. For example,
       dragonflybsd.org

     * Get mail delivered directly to your host. This is done by delivering
       mail directly to the current DNS name for your machine. For example,
       example.dragonflybsd.org.

   Regardless of which of the above you choose, in order to have mail
   delivered directly to your host, it must have a permanent static IP
   address (not a dynamic address, as with most PPP dial-up configurations).
   If you are behind a firewall, it must pass SMTP traffic on to you. If you
   want to receive mail directly at your host, you need to be sure of either
   of two things:

     * Make sure that the (lowest-numbered) MX record in your DNS points to
       your host's IP address.

     * Make sure there is no MX entry in your DNS for your host.

   Either of the above will allow you to receive mail directly at your host.

   Try this:

 # hostname
 example.dragonflybsd.org
 # host example.dragonflybsd.org
 example.dragonflybsd.org has address 204.216.27.XX

   If that is what you see, mail directly to
   <yourlogin@example.dragonflybsd.org> should work without problems
   (assuming sendmail is running correctly on example.dragonflybsd.org).

   If instead you see something like this:

 # host example.dragonflybsd.org
 example.dragonflybsd.org has address 204.216.27.XX
 example.dragonflybsd.org mail is handled (pri=10) by hub.dragonflybsd.org

   All mail sent to your host (example.dragonflybsd.org) will end up being
   collected on hub under the same username instead of being sent directly to
   your host.

   The above information is handled by your DNS server. The DNS record that
   carries mail routing information is the Mail eXchange entry. If no MX
   record exists, mail will be delivered directly to the host by way of its
   IP address.

   The MX entry for freefall.FreeBSD.org at one time looked like this:

 freefall                MX      30      mail.crl.net
 freefall                MX      40      agora.rdrop.com
 freefall                MX      10      freefall.FreeBSD.org
 freefall                MX      20      who.cdrom.com

   As you can see, freefall had many MX entries. The lowest MX number is the
   host that receives mail directly if available; if it is not accessible for
   some reason, the others (sometimes called ``backup MXes'') accept messages
   temporarily, and pass it along when a lower-numbered host becomes
   available, eventually to the lowest-numbered host.

   Alternate MX sites should have separate Internet connections from your own
   in order to be most useful. Your ISP or another friendly site should have
   no problem providing this service for you.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.6.2 Mail for Your Domain

   In order to set up a ``mailhost'' (a.k.a. mail server) you need to have
   any mail sent to various workstations directed to it. Basically, you want
   to ``claim'' any mail for any hostname in your domain (in this case
   *.dragonflybsd.org) and divert it to your mail server so your users can
   receive their mail on the master mail server.

   To make life easiest, a user account with the same username should exist
   on both machines. Use adduser(8) to do this.

   The mailhost you will be using must be the designated mail exchanger for
   each workstation on the network. This is done in your DNS configuration
   like so:

 example.dragonflybsd.org        A       204.216.27.XX           ; Workstation
                         MX      10 hub.dragonflybsd.org ; Mailhost

   This will redirect mail for the workstation to the mailhost no matter
   where the A record points. The mail is sent to the MX host.

   You cannot do this yourself unless you are running a DNS server. If you
   are not, or cannot run your own DNS server, talk to your ISP or whoever
   provides your DNS.

   If you are doing virtual email hosting, the following information will
   come in handy. For this example, we will assume you have a customer with
   his own domain, in this case customer1.org, and you want all the mail for
   customer1.org sent to your mailhost, mail.myhost.com. The entry in your
   DNS should look like this:

 customer1.org           MX      10      mail.myhost.com

   You do not need an A record for customer1.org if you only want to handle
   email for that domain.

     Note: Be aware that pinging customer1.org will not work unless an A
     record exists for it.

   The last thing that you must do is tell sendmail on your mailhost what
   domains and/or hostnames it should be accepting mail for. There are a few
   different ways this can be done. Either of the following will work:

     * Add the hosts to your /etc/mail/local-host-names file if you are using
       the FEATURE(use_cw_file).

     * Add a Cwyour.host.com line to your /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.7 SMTP with UUCP

   The sendmail configuration that ships with DragonFly is designed for sites
   that connect directly to the Internet. Sites that wish to exchange their
   mail via UUCP must install another sendmail configuration file.

   Tweaking /etc/mail/sendmail.cf manually is an advanced topic. sendmail
   version 8 generates config files via m4(1) preprocessing, where the actual
   configuration occurs on a higher abstraction level. The m4(1)
   configuration files can be found under /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf.

   If you did not install your system with full sources, the sendmail
   configuration set has been broken out into a separate source distribution
   tarball. Assuming you have your DragonFly source code CDROM mounted, do:

 # cd /cdrom/src
 # cat scontrib.?? | tar xzf - -C /usr/src/contrib/sendmail

   This extracts to only a few hundred kilobytes. The file README in the cf
   directory can serve as a basic introduction to m4(1) configuration.

   The best way to support UUCP delivery is to use the mailertable feature.
   This creates a database that sendmail can use to make routing decisions.

   First, you have to create your .mc file. The directory
   /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf contains a few examples. Assuming you
   have named your file foo.mc, all you need to do in order to convert it
   into a valid sendmail.cf is:

 # cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail/cf/cf
 # make foo.cf
 # cp foo.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

   A typical .mc file might look like:

 VERSIONID(`Your version number') OSTYPE(bsd4.4)

 FEATURE(accept_unresolvable_domains)
 FEATURE(nocanonify)
 FEATURE(mailertable, `hash -o /etc/mail/mailertable')

 define(`UUCP_RELAY', your.uucp.relay)
 define(`UUCP_MAX_SIZE', 200000)
 define(`confDONT_PROBE_INTERFACES')

 MAILER(local)
 MAILER(smtp)
 MAILER(uucp)

 Cw    your.alias.host.name
 Cw    youruucpnodename.UUCP

   The lines containing accept_unresolvable_domains, nocanonify, and
   confDONT_PROBE_INTERFACES features will prevent any usage of the DNS
   during mail delivery. The UUCP_RELAY clause is needed to support UUCP
   delivery. Simply put an Internet hostname there that is able to handle
   .UUCP pseudo-domain addresses; most likely, you will enter the mail relay
   of your ISP there.

   Once you have this, you need an /etc/mail/mailertable file. If you have
   only one link to the outside that is used for all your mails, the
   following file will suffice:

 #
 # makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable.db < /etc/mail/mailertable
 .                             uucp-dom:your.uucp.relay

   A more complex example might look like this:

 #
 # makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable.db < /etc/mail/mailertable
 #
 horus.interface-business.de   uucp-dom:horus
 .interface-business.de        uucp-dom:if-bus
 interface-business.de         uucp-dom:if-bus
 .heep.sax.de                  smtp8:%1
 horus.UUCP                    uucp-dom:horus
 if-bus.UUCP                   uucp-dom:if-bus
 .                             uucp-dom:

   The first three lines handle special cases where domain-addressed mail
   should not be sent out to the default route, but instead to some UUCP
   neighbor in order to ``shortcut'' the delivery path. The next line handles
   mail to the local Ethernet domain that can be delivered using SMTP.
   Finally, the UUCP neighbors are mentioned in the .UUCP pseudo-domain
   notation, to allow for a uucp-neighbor !recipient override of the default
   rules. The last line is always a single dot, matching everything else,
   with UUCP delivery to a UUCP neighbor that serves as your universal mail
   gateway to the world. All of the node names behind the uucp-dom: keyword
   must be valid UUCP neighbors, as you can verify using the command uuname.

   As a reminder that this file needs to be converted into a DBM database
   file before use. The command line to accomplish this is best placed as a
   comment at the top of the mailertable file. You always have to execute
   this command each time you change your mailertable file.

   Final hint: if you are uncertain whether some particular mail routing
   would work, remember the -bt option to sendmail. It starts sendmail in
   address test mode; simply enter 3,0, followed by the address you wish to
   test for the mail routing. The last line tells you the used internal mail
   agent, the destination host this agent will be called with, and the
   (possibly translated) address. Leave this mode by typing Ctrl+D.

 % sendmail -bt
 ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
 Enter <ruleset> <address>
 > 3,0 foo@example.com
 canonify           input: foo @ example . com
 ...
 parse            returns: $# uucp-dom $@ your.uucp.relay $: foo < @ example . com . >
 > ^D

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.8 Setting up to send only

   Contributed by Bill Moran.

   There are many instances where you may only want to send mail through a
   relay. Some examples are:

     * Your computer is a desktop machine, but you want to use programs from
       the command line that send mail. To do so, you should use your ISP's
       mail relay.

     * The computer is a server that does not handle mail locally, but needs
       to pass off all mail to a relay for processing.

   Just about any MTA is capable of filling this particular niche.
   Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to properly configure a
   full-featured MTA just to handle offloading mail. Programs such as
   sendmail and postfix are largely overkill for this use.

   Additionally, if you are using a typical Internet access service, your
   agreement may forbid you from running a ``mail server''.

   The easiest way to fulfill those needs is to install the mail/ssmtp port.
   Execute the following commands as root:

 # cd /usr/ports/mail/ssmtp
 # make install replace clean

   Once installed, mail/ssmtp can be configured with a four-line file located
   at /usr/local/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf:

 root=yourrealemail@example.com
 mailhub=mail.example.com
 rewriteDomain=example.com
 hostname=_HOSTNAME_

   Make sure you use your real email address for root. Enter your ISP's
   outgoing mail relay in place of mail.example.com (some ISPs call this the
   ``outgoing mail server'' or ``SMTP server'').

   Make sure you disable sendmail by setting sendmail_enable="NONE" in
   /etc/rc.conf.

   mail/ssmtp has some other options available. See the example configuration
   file in /usr/local/etc/ssmtp or the manual page of ssmtp for some examples
   and more information.

   Setting up ssmtp in this manner will allow any software on your computer
   that needs to send mail to function properly, while not violating your
   ISP's usage policy or allowing your computer to be hijacked for spamming.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.9 Using Mail with a Dialup Connection

   If you have a static IP address, you should not need to adjust anything
   from the defaults. Set your host name to your assigned Internet name and
   sendmail will do the rest.

   If you have a dynamically assigned IP number and use a dialup PPP
   connection to the Internet, you will probably have a mailbox on your ISPs
   mail server. Let's assume your ISP's domain is example.net, and that your
   user name is user, you have called your machine bsd.home, and your ISP has
   told you that you may use relay.example.net as a mail relay.

   In order to retrieve mail from your mailbox, you must install a retrieval
   agent. The fetchmail utility is a good choice as it supports many
   different protocols. This program is available as a package or from the
   ports collection (mail/fetchmail). Usually, your ISP will provide POP. If
   you are using user PPP, you can automatically fetch your mail when an
   Internet connection is established with the following entry in
   /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup:

 MYADDR:
 !bg su user -c fetchmail

   If you are using sendmail (as shown below) to deliver mail to non-local
   accounts, you probably want to have sendmail process your mailqueue as
   soon as your Internet connection is established. To do this, put this
   command after the fetchmail command in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup:

   !bg su user -c "sendmail -q"

   Assume that you have an account for user on bsd.home. In the home
   directory of user on bsd.home, create a .fetchmailrc file:

 poll example.net protocol pop3 fetchall pass MySecret

   This file should not be readable by anyone except user as it contains the
   password MySecret.

   In order to send mail with the correct from: header, you must tell
   sendmail to use user@example.net rather than user@bsd.home. You may also
   wish to tell sendmail to send all mail via relay.example.net, allowing
   quicker mail transmission.

   The following .mc file should suffice:

 VERSIONID(`bsd.home.mc version 1.0')
 OSTYPE(bsd4.4)dnl
 FEATURE(nouucp)dnl
 MAILER(local)dnl
 MAILER(smtp)dnl
 Cwlocalhost

20.10 SMTP Authentication

   Written by James Gorham.

   Having SMTP Authentication in place on your mail server has a number of
   benefits. SMTP Authentication can add another layer of security to
   sendmail, and has the benefit of giving mobile users who switch hosts the
   ability to use the same mail server without the need to reconfigure their
   mail client settings each time.

    1. Install security/cyrus-sasl from the ports. You can find this port in
       security/cyrus-sasl. security/cyrus-sasl has a number of compile time
       options to choose from and, for the method we will be using here, make
       sure to select the pwcheck option.

    2. After installing security/cyrus-sasl, edit
       /usr/local/lib/sasl/Sendmail.conf (or create it if it does not exist)
       and add the following line:

 pwcheck_method: passwd

       This method will enable sendmail to authenticate against your
       DragonFly passwd database. This saves the trouble of creating a new
       set of usernames and passwords for each user that needs to use SMTP
       authentication, and keeps the login and mail password the same.

    3. Now edit /etc/make.conf and add the following lines:

 SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/sasl1 -DSASL
 SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
 SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl

       These lines will give sendmail the proper configuration options for
       linking to cyrus-sasl at compile time. Make sure that cyrus-sasl has
       been installed before recompiling sendmail.

    4. Recompile sendmail by executing the following commands:

 # cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail
 # make cleandir
 # make obj
 # make
 # make install

       The compile of sendmail should not have any problems if /usr/src has
       not been changed extensively and the shared libraries it needs are
       available.

    5. After sendmail has been compiled and reinstalled, edit your
       /etc/mail/freebsd.mc file (or whichever file you use as your .mc file.
       Many administrators choose to use the output from hostname(1) as the
       .mc file for uniqueness). Add these lines to it:

 dnl set SASL options
 TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl
 define(`confAUTH_MECHANISMS', `GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN')dnl
 define(`confDEF_AUTH_INFO', `/etc/mail/auth-info')dnl

       These options configure the different methods available to sendmail
       for authenticating users. If you would like to use a method other than
       pwcheck, please see the included documentation.

    6. Finally, run make(1) while in /etc/mail. That will run your new .mc
       file and create a .cf file named freebsd.cf (or whatever name you have
       used for your .mc file). Then use the command make install restart,
       which will copy the file to sendmail.cf, and will properly restart
       sendmail. For more information about this process, you should refer to
       /etc/mail/Makefile.

   If all has gone correctly, you should be able to enter your login
   information into the mail client and send a test message. For further
   investigation, set the LogLevel of sendmail to 13 and watch
   /var/log/maillog for any errors.

   You may wish to add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf so this service
   will be available after every system boot:

 sasl_pwcheck_enable="YES"
 sasl_pwcheck_program="/usr/local/sbin/pwcheck"

   This will ensure the initialization of SMTP_AUTH upon system boot.

   For more information, please see the sendmail page regarding SMTP
   authentication.

20.11 Mail User Agents

   Contributed by Marc Silver.

   A Mail User Agent (MUA) is an application that is used to send and receive
   email. Furthermore, as email ``evolves'' and becomes more complex, MUA's
   are becoming increasingly powerful in the way they interact with email;
   this gives users increased functionality and flexibility. DragonFly
   contains support for numerous mail user agents, all of which can be easily
   installed using the pkgsrc collection. Users may choose between graphical
   email clients such as evolution or balsa, console based clients such as
   mutt, pine or mail, or the web interfaces used by some large
   organizations.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.11.1 mail

   mail(1) is the default Mail User Agent (MUA) in DragonFly. It is a console
   based MUA that offers all the basic functionality required to send and
   receive text-based email, though it is limited in interaction abilities
   with attachments and can only support local mailboxes.

   Although mail does not natively support interaction with POP or IMAP
   servers, these mailboxes may be downloaded to a local mbox file using an
   application such as fetchmail, which will be discussed later in this
   chapter (Section 20.12).

   In order to send and receive email, simply invoke the mail command as per
   the following example:

 % mail

   The contents of the user mailbox in /var/mail are automatically read by
   the mail utility. Should the mailbox be empty, the utility exits with a
   message indicating that no mails could be found. Once the mailbox has been
   read, the application interface is started, and a list of messages will be
   displayed. Messages are automatically numbered, as can be seen in the
   following example:

 Mail version 8.1 6/6/93.  Type ? for help.
 "/var/mail/marcs": 3 messages 3 new
 >N  1 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/510   "test"
  N  2 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/509   "user account"
  N  3 root@localhost        Mon Mar  8 14:05  14/509   "sample"

   Messages can now be read by using the t mail command, suffixed by the
   message number that should be displayed. In this example, we will read the
   first email:

 & t 1
 Message 1:
 From root@localhost  Mon Mar  8 14:05:52 2004
 X-Original-To: marcs@localhost
 Delivered-To: marcs@localhost
 To: marcs@localhost
 Subject: test
 Date: Mon,  8 Mar 2004 14:05:52 +0200 (SAST)
 From: root@localhost (Charlie Root)

 This is a test message, please reply if you receive it.

   As can be seen in the example above, the t key will cause the message to
   be displayed with full headers. To display the list of messages again, the
   h key should be used.

   If the email requires a response, you may use mail to reply, by using
   either the R or r mail keys. The R key instructs mail to reply only to the
   sender of the email, while r replies not only to the sender, but also to
   other recipients of the message. You may also suffix these commands with
   the mail number which you would like make a reply to. Once this has been
   done, the response should be entered, and the end of the message should be
   marked by a single . on a new line. An example can be seen below:

 & R 1
 To: root@localhost
 Subject: Re: test

 Thank you, I did get your email.
 .
 EOT

   In order to send new email, the m key should be used, followed by the
   recipient email address. Multiple recipients may also be specified by
   separating each address with the , delimiter. The subject of the message
   may then be entered, followed by the message contents. The end of the
   message should be specified by putting a single . on a new line.

 & mail root@localhost
 Subject: I mastered mail

 Now I can send and receive email using mail ... :)
 .
 EOT

   While inside the mail utility, the ? command may be used to display help
   at any time, the mail(1) manual page should also be consulted for more
   help with mail.

     Note: As previously mentioned, the mail(1) command was not originally
     designed to handle attachments, and thus deals with them very poorly.
     Newer MUAs such as mutt handle attachments in a much more intelligent
     way. But should you still wish to use the mail command, the
     converters/mpack port may be of considerable use.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.11.2 mutt

   mutt is a small yet very powerful Mail User Agent, with excellent
   features, just some of which include:

     * The ability to thread messages;

     * PGP support for digital signing and encryption of email;

     * MIME Support;

     * Maildir Support;

     * Highly customizable.

   All of these features help to make mutt one of the most advanced mail user
   agents available. See http://www.mutt.org for more information on mutt.

   The stable version of mutt may be installed using the mail/mutt port,
   while the current development version may be installed via the
   mail/mutt-devel port. After the port has been installed, mutt can be
   started by issuing the following command:

 % mutt

   mutt will automatically read the contents of the user mailbox in /var/mail
   and display the contents if applicable. If no mails are found in the user
   mailbox, then mutt will wait for commands from the user. The example below
   shows mutt displaying a list of messages:

   In order to read an email, simply select it using the cursor keys, and
   press the Enter key. An example of mutt displaying email can be seen
   below:

   As with the mail(1) command, mutt allows users to reply only to the sender
   of the message as well as to all recipients. To reply only to the sender
   of the email, use the r keyboard shortcut. To send a group reply, which
   will be sent to the original sender as well as all the message recipients,
   use the g shortcut.

     Note: mutt makes use of the vi(1) command as an editor for creating and
     replying to emails. This may be customized by the user by creating or
     editing their own .muttrc file in their home directory and setting the
     editor variable.

   In order to compose a new mail message, press m. After a valid subject has
   been given, mutt will start vi(1) and the mail can be written. Once the
   contents of the mail are complete, save and quit from vi and mutt will
   resume, displaying a summary screen of the mail that is to be delivered.
   In order to send the mail, press y. An example of the summary screen can
   be seen below:

   mutt also contains extensive help, which can be accessed from most of the
   menus by pressing the ? key. The top line also displays the keyboard
   shortcuts where appropriate.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  20.11.3 pine

   pine is aimed at a beginner user, but also includes some advanced
   features.

     Warning: The pine software has had several remote vulnerabilities
     discovered in the past, which allowed remote attackers to execute
     arbitrary code as users on the local system, by the action of sending a
     specially-prepared email. All such known problems have been fixed, but
     the pine code is written in a very insecure style and the DragonFly
     Security Officer believes there are likely to be other undiscovered
     vulnerabilities. You install pine at your own risk.

   The current version of pine may be installed using the mail/pine4 port.
   Once the port has installed, pine can be started by issuing the following
   command:

 % pine

   The first time that pine is run it displays a greeting page with a brief
   introduction, as well as a request from the pine development team to send
   an anonymous email message allowing them to judge how many users are using
   their client. To send this anonymous message, press Enter, or
   alternatively press E to exit the greeting without sending an anonymous
   message. An example of the greeting page can be seen below:

   Users are then presented with the main menu, which can be easily navigated
   using the cursor keys. This main menu provides shortcuts for the composing
   new mails, browsing of mail directories, and even the administration of
   address book entries. Below the main menu, relevant keyboard shortcuts to
   perform functions specific to the task at hand are shown.

   The default directory opened by pine is the inbox. To view the message
   index, press I, or select the MESSAGE INDEX option as seen below:

   The message index shows messages in the current directory, and can be
   navigated by using the cursor keys. Highlighted messages can be read by
   pressing the Enter key.

   In the screenshot below, a sample message is displayed by pine. Keyboard
   shortcuts are displayed as a reference at the bottom of the screen. An
   example of one of these shortcuts is the r key, which tells the MUA to
   reply to the current message being displayed.

   Replying to an email in pine is done using the pico editor, which is
   installed by default with pine. The pico utility makes it easy to navigate
   around the message and is slightly more forgiving on novice users than
   vi(1) or mail(1). Once the reply is complete, the message can be sent by
   pressing Ctrl+X. The pine application will ask for confirmation.

   The pine application can be customized using the SETUP option from the
   main menu. Consult http://www.washington.edu/pine/ for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.12 Using fetchmail

   Contributed by Marc Silver.

   fetchmail is a full-featured IMAP and POP client which allows users to
   automatically download mail from remote IMAP and POP servers and save it
   into local mailboxes; there it can be accessed more easily. fetchmail can
   be installed using the mail/fetchmail port, and offers various features,
   some of which include:

     * Support of POP3, APOP, KPOP, IMAP, ETRN and ODMR protocols.

     * Ability to forward mail using SMTP, which allows filtering,
       forwarding, and aliasing to function normally.

     * May be run in daemon mode to check periodically for new messages.

     * Can retrieve multiple mailboxes and forward them based on
       configuration, to different local users.

   While it is outside the scope of this document to explain all of
   fetchmail's features, some basic features will be explained. The fetchmail
   utility requires a configuration file known as .fetchmailrc, in order to
   run correctly. This file includes server information as well as login
   credentials. Due to the sensitive nature of the contents of this file, it
   is advisable to make it readable only by the owner, with the following
   command:

 % chmod 600 .fetchmailrc

   The following .fetchmailrc serves as an example for downloading a single
   user mailbox using POP. It tells fetchmail to connect to example.com using
   a username of joesoap and a password of XXX. This example assumes that the
   user joesoap is also a user on the local system.

 poll example.com protocol pop3 username "joesoap" password "XXX"

   The next example connects to multiple POP and IMAP servers and redirects
   to different local usernames where applicable:

 poll example.com proto pop3:
 user "joesoap", with password "XXX", is "jsoap" here;
 user "andrea", with password "XXXX";
 poll example2.net proto imap:
 user "john", with password "XXXXX", is "myth" here;

   The fetchmail utility can be run in daemon mode by running it with the -d
   flag, followed by the interval (in seconds) that fetchmail should poll
   servers listed in the .fetchmailrc file. The following example would cause
   fetchmail to poll every 60 seconds:

 % fetchmail -d 60

   More information on fetchmail can be found at
   http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

20.13 Using procmail

   Contributed by Marc Silver.

   The procmail utility is an incredibly powerful application used to filter
   incoming mail. It allows users to define ``rules'' which can be matched to
   incoming mails to perform specific functions or to reroute mail to
   alternative mailboxes and/or email addresses. procmail can be installed
   using the mail/procmail port. Once installed, it can be directly
   integrated into most MTAs; consult your MTA documentation for more
   information. Alternatively, procmail can be integrated by adding the
   following line to a .forward in the home directory of the user utilizing
   procmail features:

 "|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail || exit 75"

   The following section will display some basic procmail rules, as well as
   brief descriptions on what they do. These rules, and others must be
   inserted into a .procmailrc file, which must reside in the user's home
   directory.

   

   The majority of these rules can also be found in the procmailex(5) manual
   page.

   Forward all mail from user@example.com to an external address of
   goodmail@example2.com:

 :0
 * ^From.*user@example.com
 ! goodmail@example2.com

   Forward all mails shorter than 1000 bytes to an external address of
   goodmail@example2.com:

 :0
 * < 1000
 ! goodmail@example2.com

   Send all mail sent to alternate@example.com into a mailbox called
   alternate:

 :0
 * ^TOalternate@example.com
 alternate

   Send all mail with a subject of ``Spam'' to /dev/null:

 :0
 ^Subject:.*Spam
 /dev/null

   A useful recipe that parses incoming dragonflybsd.org mailing lists and
   places each list in its own mailbox:

 :0
 * ^List-Post: <mailto:\/[^@]+
 {
         LISTNAME=${MATCH}
         :0
         * LISTNAME??^\/[^-]+
         DragonFly-${MATCH}
 }

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Chapter 21 Updating DragonFly

   Written by Justin Sherrill.

21.1 Initial Setup

   Updates to the DragonFly source code is performed using cvsup. cvsup
   compares your local system source or ports files to a remote repository,
   and downloads any changes. Only the differences in the files are
   downloaded, saving on bandwidth and time.

   cvsup exists as a port (net/cvsup) and traditionally had to be installed
   separately on FreeBSD. With DragonFly, the binary is installed as part of
   the base system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

21.2 Configuration

   cvsup is guided by a configuration file that describes what files to
   update, and the source from which to update them.

   Here is a basic DragonFly cvsup configuration file:

 *default host=cvsup.dragonflybsd.org
 *default base=/usr
 *default prefix=/usr
 *default release=cvs
 *default release=cvs tag=.
 *default delete use-rel-suffix
 *default compress


 cvs-src

   Alternately, the file /usr/share/examples/cvsup/DragonFly-src-supfile can
   be used as-is to update system source.

   Run cvsup using /usr/share/examples/cvsup/DragonFly-src-supfile as an
   argument or with a separate file containing the above example text. Your
   system source files will be updated.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

21.3 Preparing to Update

   If you want to create a custom kernel, see Chapter 9. This is not needed
   to update your system unless there is a specific feature that needs to be
   added to the kernel.

   Check recent mail traffic on DragonFly Kernel mailing list and the file
   /usr/src/UPDATING. Any recent problems or changes should be described
   there. /usr/src/UPDATING also contains abbreviated build instructions in
   case these directions are not available.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

21.4 Updating the System

   Updating the system is a relatively simple process. As root, in /usr/src:

 % make buildworld
 % make buildkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC
 % make installkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC
 % make installworld
 % make upgrade
 (reboot)

   An explanation of each step follows.

     * make buildworld : This command rebuilds all userland programs. This is
       the most time-consuming step.

     * make buildkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC : This builds the kernel using the
       config file specified by KERNCONF. If you've created a different
       kernel configuration file as detailed in Chapter 9, use that instead
       of GENERIC. If KERNCONF isn't specified, the GENERIC configuration
       file (installed by default) is used.

     * make installkernel KERNCONF=GENERIC : This installs the kernel using
       the config file specified by KERNCONF. The value of KERNCONF must
       match what was specified in the make buildkernel command, so that
       files that match this configuration can be installed correctly. As
       with make buildkernel, KERNCONF will be set to GENERIC if not
       otherwise specified.

     * make installworld : This copies all the files built in the buildworld
       step (i.e. everything that is not the kernel) to the proper places in
       the filesystem.

     * make upgrade : This cleans out any files made unnecessary by this
       upgrade.

     * (reboot) : Reboot the computer to load the new kernel and use the new
       files installed as part of this process.

   If your computer fails to reboot, check the Section 9.6 section of the
   handbook.

                     Chapter 22 Linux Binary Compatibility

   Restructured and parts updated by Jim Mock. Originally contributed by
   Brian N. Handy and Rich Murphey.

22.1 Synopsis

   DragonFly provides binary compatibility with several other UNIX like
   operating systems, including Linux. At this point, you may be asking
   yourself why exactly, does DragonFly need to be able to run Linux
   binaries? The answer to that question is quite simple. Many companies and
   developers develop only for Linux, since it is the latest ``hot thing'' in
   the computing world. That leaves the rest of us DragonFly users bugging
   these same companies and developers to put out native DragonFly versions
   of their applications. The problem is, that most of these companies do not
   really realize how many people would use their product if there were
   DragonFly versions too, and most continue to only develop for Linux. So
   what is a DragonFly user to do? This is where the Linux binary
   compatibility of DragonFly comes into play.

   In a nutshell, the compatibility allows DragonFly users to run about 90%
   of all Linux applications without modification. This includes applications
   such as StarOffice, the Linux version of Netscape, Adobe(R) Acrobat(R),
   RealPlayer(R) 5 and 7, VMware(TM), Oracle, WordPerfect(R), Doom, Quake,
   and more. It is also reported that in some situations, Linux binaries
   perform better on DragonFly than they do under Linux.

   There are, however, some Linux-specific operating system features that are
   not supported under DragonFly. Linux binaries will not work on DragonFly
   if they overly use the Linux /proc file system (which is different from
   DragonFly's /proc file system), or i386 specific calls, such as enabling
   virtual 8086 mode.

   After reading this chapter, you will know:

     * How to enable Linux binary compatibility on your system.

     * How to install additional Linux shared libraries.

     * How to install Linux applications on your DragonFly system.

     * The implementation details of Linux compatibility in DragonFly.

   Before reading this chapter, you should:

     * Know how to install additional third-party software (Chapter 4).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

22.2 Installation

   Linux binary compatibility is not turned on by default. The easiest way to
   enable this functionality is to load the linux KLD object (``Kernel
   Loadable Device''). You can load this module by simply typing linux at the
   command prompt.

   If you would like Linux compatibility to always be enabled, then you
   should add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

 linux_enable="YES"

   The kldstat(8) command can be used to verify that the KLD is loaded:

 % kldstat
 Id Refs Address    Size     Name
  1    2 0xc0100000 16bdb8   kernel
  7    1 0xc24db000 d000     linux.ko

   If for some reason you do not want to or cannot load the KLD, then you may
   statically link Linux binary compatibility into the kernel by adding
   options COMPAT_LINUX to your kernel configuration file. Then install your
   new kernel as described in Chapter 9.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.2.1 Installing Linux Runtime Libraries

   This can be done one of two ways, either by using the suse package, or by
   installing them manually.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.2.1.1 Installing Using suse Package

   This is by far the easiest method to use when installing the runtime
   libraries. It is just like installing any other package from the pkgsrc
   collection. Simply do the following:

 # cd /usr/pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/suse9
 # make install distclean
 # ln -s /usr/pkg/emul /compat

   You should now have working Linux binary compatibility. Some programs may
   complain about incorrect minor versions of the system libraries. In
   general, however, this does not seem to be a problem.

     Note: There may be multiple versions of the meta-pkgs/suse package
     available, corresponding to different versions of various Linux
     distributions. You should install the package most closely resembling
     the requirements of the Linux applications you would like to install.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.2.1.2 Installing Libraries Manually

   If you do not have the ``pkgsrc'' collection installed, you can install
   the libraries by hand instead. You will need the Linux shared libraries
   that the program depends on and the runtime linker. Also, you will need to
   create a ``shadow root'' directory, /compat/linux, for Linux libraries on
   your DragonFly system. Any shared libraries opened by Linux programs run
   under DragonFly will look in this tree first. So, if a Linux program
   loads, for example, /lib/libc.so, DragonFly will first try to open
   /compat/linux/lib/libc.so, and if that does not exist, it will then try
   /lib/libc.so. Shared libraries should be installed in the shadow tree
   /compat/linux/lib rather than the paths that the Linux ld.so reports.

   Generally, you will need to look for the shared libraries that Linux
   binaries depend on only the first few times that you install a Linux
   program on your DragonFly system. After a while, you will have a
   sufficient set of Linux shared libraries on your system to be able to run
   newly imported Linux binaries without any extra work.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.2.1.3 How to Install Additional Shared Libraries

   What if you install the suse package and your application still complains
   about missing shared libraries? How do you know which shared libraries
   Linux binaries need, and where to get them? Basically, there are 2
   possibilities (when following these instructions you will need to be root
   on your DragonFly system).

   If you have access to a Linux system, see what shared libraries the
   application needs, and copy them to your DragonFly system. Look at the
   following example:

   Let us assume you used FTP to get the Linux binary of Doom, and put it on
   a Linux system you have access to. You then can check which shared
   libraries it needs by running ldd linuxdoom, like so:

 % ldd linuxdoom
 libXt.so.3 (DLL Jump 3.1) => /usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.3.1.0
 libX11.so.3 (DLL Jump 3.1) => /usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.3.1.0
 libc.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.5pl26) => /lib/libc.so.4.6.29

   You would need to get all the files from the last column, and put them
   under /compat/linux, with the names in the first column as symbolic links
   pointing to them. This means you eventually have these files on your
   DragonFly system:

 /compat/linux/usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.3.1.0
 /compat/linux/usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.3 -> libXt.so.3.1.0
 /compat/linux/usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.3.1.0
 /compat/linux/usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.3 -> libX11.so.3.1.0
 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4.6.29
 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4 -> libc.so.4.6.29

       Note: Note that if you already have a Linux shared library with a
       matching major revision number to the first column of the ldd output,
       you will not need to copy the file named in the last column to your
       system, the one you already have should work. It is advisable to copy
       the shared library anyway if it is a newer version, though. You can
       remove the old one, as long as you make the symbolic link point to the
       new one. So, if you have these libraries on your system:

 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4.6.27
 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4 -> libc.so.4.6.27

       and you find a new binary that claims to require a later version
       according to the output of ldd:

 libc.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.5pl26) -> libc.so.4.6.29

       If it is only one or two versions out of date in the in the trailing
       digit then do not worry about copying /lib/libc.so.4.6.29 too, because
       the program should work fine with the slightly older version. However,
       if you like, you can decide to replace the libc.so anyway, and that
       should leave you with:

 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4.6.29
 /compat/linux/lib/libc.so.4 -> libc.so.4.6.29

       Note: The symbolic link mechanism is only needed for Linux binaries.
       The DragonFly runtime linker takes care of looking for matching major
       revision numbers itself and you do not need to worry about it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.2.2 Installing Linux ELF Binaries

   ELF binaries sometimes require an extra step of ``branding''. If you
   attempt to run an unbranded ELF binary, you will get an error message like
   the following:

 % ./my-linux-elf-binary
 ELF binary type not known
 Abort

   To help the DragonFly kernel distinguish between a DragonFly ELF binary
   from a Linux binary, use the brandelf(1) utility.

 % brandelf -t Linux my-linux-elf-binary

   The GNU toolchain now places the appropriate branding information into ELF
   binaries automatically, so this step should only be needed for older,
   libc5 binaries.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.2.3 Configuring the Hostname Resolver

   If DNS does not work or you get this message:

 resolv+: "bind" is an invalid keyword resolv+:
 "hosts" is an invalid keyword

   You will need to configure a /compat/linux/etc/host.conf file containing:

 order hosts, bind
 multi on

   The order here specifies that /etc/hosts is searched first and DNS is
   searched second. When /compat/linux/etc/host.conf is not installed, Linux
   applications find DragonFly's /etc/host.conf and complain about the
   incompatible DragonFly syntax. You should remove bind if you have not
   configured a name server using the /etc/resolv.conf file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

22.3 Installing Mathematica(R)

   Updated for Mathematica 4.X by Murray Stokely. Merged with work by Bojan
   Bistrovic.

   This document describes the process of installing the Linux version of
   Mathematica 4.X onto a DragonFly system.

     Warning: This description applies to FreeBSD, for which it was
     originally written. This may or may not apply to DragonFly at this
     point; while FreeBSD 4.x features usually translate over to DragonFly
     well, your mileage may vary.

   The Linux version of Mathematica runs perfectly under DragonFly however
   the binaries shipped by Wolfram need to be branded so that DragonFly knows
   to use the Linux ABI to execute them.

   The Linux version of Mathematica or Mathematica for Students can be
   ordered directly from Wolfram at http://www.wolfram.com/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.3.1 Branding the Linux Binaries

   The Linux binaries are located in the Unix directory of the Mathematica
   CDROM distributed by Wolfram. You need to copy this directory tree to your
   local hard drive so that you can brand the Linux binaries with brandelf(1)
   before running the installer:

 # mount /cdrom
 # cp -rp /cdrom/Unix/ /localdir/
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux/*
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/*
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/Installation/Binaries/Linux/*
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/Graphics/Binaries/Linux/*
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/Converters/Binaries/Linux/*
 # brandelf -t Linux /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/LicenseManager/Binaries/Linux/mathlm
 # cd /localdir/Installers/Linux/
 # ./MathInstaller

   Alternatively, you can simply set the default ELF brand to Linux for all
   unbranded binaries with the command:

 # sysctl kern.fallback_elf_brand=3

   This will make DragonFly assume that unbranded ELF binaries use the Linux
   ABI and so you should be able to run the installer straight from the
   CDROM.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.3.2 Obtaining Your Mathematica Password

   Before you can run Mathematica you will have to obtain a password from
   Wolfram that corresponds to your ``machine ID''.

   Once you have installed the Linux compatibility runtime libraries and
   unpacked Mathematica you can obtain the ``machine ID'' by running the
   program mathinfo in the installation directory. This machine ID is based
   solely on the MAC address of your first Ethernet card.

 # cd /localdir/Files/SystemFiles/Installation/Binaries/Linux
 # mathinfo
 disco.example.com 7115-70839-20412

   When you register with Wolfram, either by email, phone or fax, you will
   give them the ``machine ID'' and they will respond with a corresponding
   password consisting of groups of numbers. You can then enter this
   information when you attempt to run Mathematica for the first time exactly
   as you would for any other Mathematica platform.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.3.3 Running the Mathematica Frontend over a Network

   Mathematica uses some special fonts to display characters not present in
   any of the standard font sets (integrals, sums, Greek letters, etc.). The
   X protocol requires these fonts to be install locally. This means you will
   have to copy these fonts from the CDROM or from a host with Mathematica
   installed to your local machine. These fonts are normally stored in
   /cdrom/Unix/Files/SystemFiles/Fonts on the CDROM, or
   /usr/local/mathematica/SystemFiles/Fonts on your hard drive. The actual
   fonts are in the subdirectories Type1 and X. There are several ways to use
   them, as described below.

   The first way is to copy them into one of the existing font directories in
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts. This will require editing the fonts.dir file,
   adding the font names to it, and changing the number of fonts on the first
   line. Alternatively, you should also just be able to run mkfontdir(1) in
   the directory you have copied them to.

   The second way to do this is to copy the directories to
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts:

 # cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
 # mkdir X
 # mkdir MathType1
 # cd /cdrom/Unix/Files/SystemFiles/Fonts
 # cp X/* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/X
 # cp Type1/* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/MathType1
 # cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/X
 # mkfontdir
 # cd ../MathType1
 # mkfontdir

   Now add the new font directories to your font path:

 # xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/X
 # xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/MathType1
 # xset fp rehash

   If you are using the XFree86 server, you can have these font directories
   loaded automatically by adding them to your XF86Config file.

   If you do not already have a directory called
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1, you can change the name of the MathType1
   directory in the example above to Type1.

22.4 Installing Maple(TM)

   Contributed by Aaron Kaplan. Thanks to Robert Getschmann.

   Maple(TM) is a commercial mathematics program similar to Mathematica. You
   must purchase this software from http://www.maplesoft.com/ and then
   register there for a license file. To install this software on DragonFly,
   please follow these simple steps.

     Warning: This description applies to FreeBSD, for which it was
     originally written. This may or may not apply to DragonFly at this
     point; while FreeBSD 4.x features usually translate over to DragonFly
     well, your mileage may vary.

    1. Execute the INSTALL shell script from the product distribution. Choose
       the ``RedHat'' option when prompted by the installation program. A
       typical installation directory might be /usr/local/maple.

    2. If you have not done so, order a license for Maple from Maple Waterloo
       Software (http://register.maplesoft.com/) and copy it to
       /usr/local/maple/license/license.dat.

    3. Install the FLEXlm license manager by running the INSTALL_LIC install
       shell script that comes with Maple. Specify the primary hostname for
       your machine for the license server.

    4. Patch the /usr/local/maple/bin/maple.system.type file with the
       following:

    ----- snip ------------------
 *** maple.system.type.orig      Sun Jul  8 16:35:33 2001
 --- maple.system.type   Sun Jul  8 16:35:51 2001
 ***************
 *** 72,77 ****
 --- 72,78 ----
           # the IBM RS/6000 AIX case
           MAPLE_BIN="bin.IBM_RISC_UNIX"
           ;;
 +     "DragonFly"|\
       "Linux")
           # the Linux/x86 case
         # We have two Linux implementations, one for Red Hat and
    ----- snip end of patch -----

       Please note that after the "DragonFly"|\ no other whitespace should be
       present.

       This patch instructs Maple to recognize ``DragonFly'' as a type of
       Linux system. The bin/maple shell script calls the
       bin/maple.system.type shell script which in turn calls uname -a to
       find out the operating system name. Depending on the OS name it will
       find out which binaries to use.

    5. Start the license server.

       The following script, installed as /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lmgrd.sh is a
       convenient way to start up lmgrd:

    ----- snip ------------

 #! /bin/sh
 PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
 PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/maple/bin:/usr/local/maple/FLEXlm/UNIX/LINUX
 export PATH

 LICENSE_FILE=/usr/local/maple/license/license.dat
 LOG=/var/log/lmgrd.log

 case "$1" in
 start)
         lmgrd -c ${LICENSE_FILE} 2>> ${LOG} 1>&2
         echo -n " lmgrd"
         ;;
 stop)
         lmgrd -c ${LICENSE_FILE} -x lmdown 2>> ${LOG} 1>&2
         ;;
 *)
         echo "Usage: `basename $0` {start|stop}" 1>&2
         exit 64
         ;;
 esac

 exit 0
    ----- snip ------------

    6. Test-start Maple:

 % cd /usr/local/maple/bin
 % ./xmaple

       You should be up and running. Make sure to write Maplesoft to let them
       know you would like a native DragonFly version!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.4.1 Common Pitfalls

     * The FLEXlm license manager can be a difficult tool to work with.
       Additional documentation on the subject can be found at
       http://www.globetrotter.com/.

     * lmgrd is known to be very picky about the license file and to core
       dump if there are any problems. A correct license file should look
       like this:

 # =======================================================
 # License File for UNIX Installations ("Pointer File")
 # =======================================================
 SERVER chillig ANY
 #USE_SERVER
 VENDOR maplelmg

 FEATURE Maple maplelmg 2000.0831 permanent 1 XXXXXXXXXXXX \
          PLATFORMS=i86_r ISSUER="Waterloo Maple Inc." \
          ISSUED=11-may-2000 NOTICE=" Technische Universitat Wien" \
          SN=XXXXXXXXX

         Note: Serial number and key 'X''ed out. chillig is a hostname.

       Editing the license file works as long as you do not touch the
       ``FEATURE'' line (which is protected by the license key).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

22.5 Installing MATLAB(R)

   Contributed by Dan Pelleg.

   This document describes the process of installing the Linux version of
   MATLAB(R) version 6.5 onto a DragonFly system. It works quite well, with
   the exception of the Java Virtual Machine(TM) (see Section 22.5.3).

   The Linux version of MATLAB can be ordered directly from The MathWorks at
   http://www.mathworks.com. Make sure you also get the license file or
   instructions how to create it. While you are there, let them know you
   would like a native DragonFly version of their software.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.1 Installing MATLAB

   To install MATLAB, do the following:

    1. Insert the installation CD and mount it. Become root, as recommended
       by the installation script. To start the installation script type:

 # /compat/linux/bin/sh /cdrom/install

         Tip: The installer is graphical. If you get errors about not being
         able to open a display, type setenv HOME ~USER, where USER is the
         user you did a su(1) as.

    2. When asked for the MATLAB root directory, type:
       /compat/linux/usr/local/matlab.

         Tip: For easier typing on the rest of the installation process, type
         this at your shell prompt: set MATLAB=/compat/linux/usr/local/matlab

    3. Edit the license file as instructed when obtaining the MATLAB license.

         Tip: You can prepare this file in advance using your favorite
         editor, and copy it to $MATLAB/license.dat before the installer asks
         you to edit it.

    4. Complete the installation process.

   At this point your MATLAB installation is complete. The following steps
   apply ``glue'' to connect it to your DragonFly system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.2 License Manager Startup

    1. Create symlinks for the license manager scripts:

 # ln -s $MATLAB/etc/lmboot /usr/local/etc/lmboot_TMW
 # ln -s $MATLAB/etc/lmdown /usr/local/etc/lmdown_TMW

    2. Create a startup file at /usr/local/etc/rc.d/flexlm.sh. The example
       below is a modified version of the distributed
       $MATLAB/etc/rc.lm.glnx86. The changes are file locations, and startup
       of the license manager under Linux emulation.

 #!/bin/sh
 case "$1" in
   start)
         if [ -f /usr/local/etc/lmboot_TMW ]; then
               /compat/linux/bin/sh /usr/local/etc/lmboot_TMW -u username && echo 'MATLAB_lmgrd'
         fi
         ;;
   stop)
         if [ -f /usr/local/etc/lmdown_TMW ]; then
             /compat/linux/bin/sh /usr/local/etc/lmdown_TMW  > /dev/null 2>&1
         fi
         ;;
   *)
         echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
         exit 1
         ;;
 esac

 exit 0

         Important: The file must be made executable:

 # chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/flexlm.sh

         You must also replace username above with the name of a valid user
         on your system (and not root).

    3. Start the license manager with the command:

 # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/flexlm.sh start

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.3 Linking the Java Runtime Environment

   Change the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) link to one working under
   DragonFly:

 # cd $MATLAB/sys/java/jre/glnx86/
 # unlink jre; ln -s ./jre1.1.8 ./jre

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.4 Creating a MATLAB Startup Script

    1. Place the following startup script in /usr/local/bin/matlab:

 #!/bin/sh
 /compat/linux/bin/sh /compat/linux/usr/local/matlab/bin/matlab "$@"

    2. Then type the command chmod +x /usr/local/bin/matlab.

     Tip: Depending on your version of emulators/linux_base, you may run into
     errors when running this script. To avoid that, edit the file
     /compat/linux/usr/local/matlab/bin/matlab, and change the line that
     says:

 if [ `expr "$lscmd" : '.*->.*'` -ne 0 ]; then

     (in version 13.0.1 it is on line 410) to this line:

 if test -L $newbase; then

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.5 Creating a MATLAB Shutdown Script

   The following is needed to solve a problem with MATLAB not exiting
   correctly.

    1. Create a file $MATLAB/toolbox/local/finish.m, and in it put the single
       line:

 ! $MATLAB/bin/finish.sh

         Note: The $MATLAB is literal.

         Tip: In the same directory, you will find the files finishsav.m and
         finishdlg.m, which let you save your workspace before quitting. If
         you use either of them, insert the line above immediately after the
         save command.

    2. Create a file $MATLAB/bin/finish.sh, which will contain the following:

 #!/usr/compat/linux/bin/sh
 (sleep 5; killall -1 matlab_helper) &
 exit 0

    3. Make the file executable:

 # chmod +x $MATLAB/bin/finish.sh

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.5.6 Using MATLAB

   At this point you are ready to type matlab and start using it.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

22.6 Installing Oracle(R)

   Contributed by Marcel Moolenaar.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.6.1 Preface

   This document describes the process of installing Oracle 8.0.5 and Oracle
   8.0.5.1 Enterprise Edition for Linux onto a DragonFly machine.

     Warning: This description applies to FreeBSD, for which it was
     originally written. This may or may not apply to DragonFly at this
     point; while FreeBSD 4.x features usually translate over to DragonFly
     well, your mileage may vary.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.6.2 Installing the Linux Environment

   Make sure you have both emulators/linux_base and devel/linux_devtools from
   the ports collection installed. If you run into difficulties with these
   ports, you may have to use the packages or older versions available in the
   ports collection.

   If you want to run the intelligent agent, you will also need to install
   the Red Hat Tcl package: tcl-8.0.3-20.i386.rpm. The general command for
   installing packages with the official RPM port (archivers/rpm) is:

 # rpm -i --ignoreos --root /compat/linux --dbpath /var/lib/rpm package

   Installation of the package should not generate any errors.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.6.3 Creating the Oracle Environment

   Before you can install Oracle, you need to set up a proper environment.
   This document only describes what to do specially to run Oracle for Linux
   on DragonFly, not what has been described in the Oracle installation
   guide.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.6.3.1 Kernel Tuning

   As described in the Oracle installation guide, you need to set the maximum
   size of shared memory. Do not use SHMMAX under DragonFly. SHMMAX is merely
   calculated out of SHMMAXPGS and PGSIZE. Therefore define SHMMAXPGS. All
   other options can be used as described in the guide. For example:

 options SHMMAXPGS=10000
 options SHMMNI=100
 options SHMSEG=10
 options SEMMNS=200
 options SEMMNI=70
 options SEMMSL=61

   Set these options to suit your intended use of Oracle.

   Also, make sure you have the following options in your kernel
   configuration file:

 options SYSVSHM #SysV shared memory
 options SYSVSEM #SysV semaphores
 options SYSVMSG #SysV interprocess communication

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.6.3.2 Oracle Account

   Create an oracle account just as you would create any other account. The
   oracle account is special only that you need to give it a Linux shell. Add
   /compat/linux/bin/bash to /etc/shells and set the shell for the oracle
   account to /compat/linux/bin/bash.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.6.3.3 Environment

   Besides the normal Oracle variables, such as ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID
   you must set the following environment variables:

      Variable                               Value                            
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ORACLE_HOME/lib                                           
   CLASSPATH       $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/classes111.zip                       
                   /compat/linux/bin /compat/linux/sbin /compat/linux/usr/bin 
   PATH            /compat/linux/usr/sbin /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin       
                   /usr/local/bin $ORACLE_HOME/bin                            

   It is advised to set all the environment variables in .profile. A complete
   example is:

 ORACLE_BASE=/oracle; export ORACLE_BASE
 ORACLE_HOME=/oracle; export ORACLE_HOME
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 ORACLE_SID=ORCL; export ORACLE_SID
 ORACLE_TERM=386x; export ORACLE_TERM
 CLASSPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/classes111.zip
 export CLASSPATH
 PATH=/compat/linux/bin:/compat/linux/sbin:/compat/linux/usr/bin
 PATH=$PATH:/compat/linux/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
 PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:$ORACLE_HOME/bin
 export PATH

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.6.4 Installing Oracle

   Due to a slight inconsistency in the Linux emulator, you need to create a
   directory named .oracle in /var/tmp before you start the installer. Either
   make it world writable or let it be owned by the oracle user. You should
   be able to install Oracle without any problems. If you have problems,
   check your Oracle distribution and/or configuration first! After you have
   installed Oracle, apply the patches described in the next two subsections.

   A frequent problem is that the TCP protocol adapter is not installed
   right. As a consequence, you cannot start any TCP listeners. The following
   actions help solve this problem:

 # cd $ORACLE_HOME/network/lib
 # make -f ins_network.mk ntcontab.o
 # cd $ORACLE_HOME/lib
 # ar r libnetwork.a ntcontab.o
 # cd $ORACLE_HOME/network/lib
 # make -f ins_network.mk install

   Do not forget to run root.sh again!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.6.4.1 Patching root.sh

   When installing Oracle, some actions, which need to be performed as root,
   are recorded in a shell script called root.sh. This script is written in
   the orainst directory. Apply the following patch to root.sh, to have it
   use to proper location of chown or alternatively run the script under a
   Linux native shell.

 *** orainst/root.sh.orig Tue Oct 6 21:57:33 1998
 --- orainst/root.sh Mon Dec 28 15:58:53 1998
 ***************
 *** 31,37 ****
 # This is the default value for CHOWN
 # It will redefined later in this script for those ports
 # which have it conditionally defined in ss_install.h
 ! CHOWN=/bin/chown
 #
 # Define variables to be used in this script
 --- 31,37 ----
 # This is the default value for CHOWN
 # It will redefined later in this script for those ports
 # which have it conditionally defined in ss_install.h
 ! CHOWN=/usr/sbin/chown
 #
 # Define variables to be used in this script

   When you do not install Oracle from CD, you can patch the source for
   root.sh. It is called rthd.sh and is located in the orainst directory in
   the source tree.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.6.4.2 Patching genclntsh

   The script genclntsh is used to create a single shared client library. It
   is used when building the demos. Apply the following patch to comment out

22.7 Installing SAP(R) R/3(R)

   Contributed by Holger Kipp. Original version converted to SGML by
   Valentino Vaschetto.

   Installations of SAP Systems using DragonFly will not be supported by the
   SAP support team -- they only offer support for certified platforms.

     Warning: This description applies to FreeBSD, for which it was
     originally written. This may or may not apply to DragonFly at this
     point; while FreeBSD 4.x features usually translate over to DragonFly
     well, your mileage may vary.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.1 Preface

   This document describes a possible way of installing a SAP R/3 System with
   Oracle Database for Linux onto a DragonFly machine, including the
   installation of DragonFly and Oracle. Two different configurations will be
   described:

     * SAP R/3 4.6B (IDES) with Oracle 8.0.5 on FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE

     * SAP R/3 4.6C with Oracle 8.1.7 on FreeBSD 4.5-STABLE

   Even though this document tries to describe all important steps in a
   greater detail, it is not intended as a replacement for the Oracle and
   SAP R/3 installation guides.

   Please see the documentation that comes with the SAP R/3 Linux edition for
   SAP and Oracle specific questions, as well as resources from Oracle and
   SAP OSS.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.2 Software

   The following CD-ROMs have been used for SAP installations:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.2.1 SAP R/3 4.6B, Oracle 8.0.5

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Name   |  Number  |                    Description                    |

   | EXPORT6 | 51010213 | IDES / DB-Export / Disc 6 of 6                    |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Additionally, we used the Oracle 8 Server (Pre-production version 8.0.5
   for Linux, Kernel Version 2.0.33) CD which is not really necessary, and
   FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE (it was only a few days past 4.3 RELEASE).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.2.2 SAP R/3 4.6C SR2, Oracle 8.1.7

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Name   |  Number  |                    Description                    |

   | EXPORT1 | 51013953 | Release 4.6C SR2 / Export / Disc 1 of 4           |
   |---------+----------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | EXPORT1 | 51013953 | Release 4.6C SR2 / Export / Disc 2 of 4           |
   |---------+----------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | EXPORT1 | 51013953 | Release 4.6C SR2 / Export / Disc 3 of 4           |
   |---------+----------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | EXPORT1 | 51013953 | Release 4.6C SR2 / Export / Disc 4 of 4           |
   |---------+----------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | LANG1   | 51013954 | Release 4.6C SR2 / Language / DE, EN, FR / Disc 1 |
   |         |          | of 3                                              |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Depending on the languages you would like to install, additional language
   CDs might be necessary. Here we are just using DE and EN, so the first
   language CD is the only one needed. As a little note, the numbers for all
   four EXPORT CDs are identical. All three language CDs also have the same
   number (this is different from the 4.6B IDES release CD numbering). At the
   time of writing this installation is running on FreeBSD 4.5-STABLE
   (20.03.2002).

  22.7.3 SAP Notes

   The following notes should be read before installing SAP R/3 and proved to
   be useful during installation:

  22.7.4 Hardware Requirements

   The following equipment is sufficient for the installation of a SAP R/3
   System. For production use, a more exact sizing is of course needed:

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |    Component    |          4.6B          |          4.6C          |
   |-----------------+------------------------+------------------------|
   | Processor       | 2 x 800MHz Pentium III | 2 x 800MHz Pentium III |
   |-----------------+------------------------+------------------------|
   | Memory          | 1GB ECC                | 2GB ECC                |
   |-----------------+------------------------+------------------------|
   | Hard Disk Space | 50-60GB (IDES)         | 50-60GB (IDES)         |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

   For use in production, Xeon Processors with large cache, high-speed disk
   access (SCSI, RAID hardware controller), USV and ECC-RAM is recommended.
   The large amount of hard disk space is due to the preconfigured IDES
   System, which creates 27 GB of database files during installation. This
   space is also sufficient for initial production systems and application
   data.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.4.1 SAP R/3 4.6B, Oracle 8.0.5

   The following off-the-shelf hardware was used: a dual processor board with
   two 800 MHz Pentium III processors, Adaptec 29160 Ultra160 SCSI adapter
   (for accessing a 40/80 GB DLT tape drive and CDROM), Mylex AcceleRAID(TM)
   (2 channels, firmware 6.00-1-00 with 32 MB RAM). To the Mylex RAID
   controller are attached two 17 GB hard disks (mirrored) and four 36 GB
   hard disks (RAID level 5).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.4.2 SAP R/3 4.6C, Oracle 8.1.7

   For this installation a Dell(TM) PowerEdge(TM) 2500 was used: a dual
   processor board with two 1000 MHz Pentium III processors (256 kB Cache),
   2 GB PC133 ECC SDRAM, PERC/3 DC PCI RAID Controller with 128 MB, and an
   EIDE DVD-ROM drive. To the RAID controller are attached two 18 GB hard
   disks (mirrored) and four 36 GB hard disks (RAID level 5).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.5 Installation of FreeBSD

   First you have to install FreeBSD.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.5.1 Disk Layout

   To keep it simple, the same disk layout both for the SAP R/3 46B and
   SAP R/3 46C SR2 installation was used. Only the device names changed, as
   the installations were on different hardware (/dev/da and /dev/amr
   respectively, so if using an AMI MegaRAID, one will see /dev/amr0s1a
   instead of /dev/da0s1a):

   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | File system | Size (1k-blocks) | Size (GB) |      Mounted on       |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da0s1a | 1.016.303        | 1         | /                     |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da0s1b |                  | 6         | swap                  |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da0s1e | 2.032.623        | 2         | /var                  |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da0s1f | 8.205.339        | 8         | /usr                  |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da1s1e | 45.734.361       | 45        | /compat/linux/oracle  |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da1s1f | 2.032.623        | 2         | /compat/linux/sapmnt  |
   |-------------+------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
   | /dev/da1s1g | 2.032.623        | 2         | /compat/linux/usr/sap |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Configure and initialize the two logical drives with the Mylex or PERC/3
   RAID software beforehand. The software can be started during the BIOS boot
   phase.

   Please note that this disk layout differs slightly from the SAP
   recommendations, as SAP suggests mounting the Oracle subdirectories (and
   some others) separately -- we decided to just create them as real
   subdirectories for simplicity.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.5.2 make world and a New Kernel

   Download the latest -STABLE sources. Rebuild world and your custom kernel
   after configuring your kernel configuration file. Here you should also
   include the kernel parameters which are required for both SAP R/3 and
   Oracle.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.6 Installing the Linux Environment

    22.7.6.1 Installing the Linux Base System

   First the linux_base port needs to be installed (as root):

 # cd /usr/ports/emulators/linux_base
 # make install distclean

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.6.2 Installing Linux Development Environment

   The Linux development environment is needed, if you want to install Oracle
   on FreeBSD according to the Section 22.6:

 # cd /usr/ports/devel/linux_devtools
 # make install distclean

   The Linux development environment has only been installed for the SAP R/3
   46B IDES installation. It is not needed, if the Oracle DB is not relinked
   on the FreeBSD system. This is the case if you are using the Oracle
   tarball from a Linux system.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.6.3 Installing the Necessary RPMs

   To start the R3SETUP program, PAM support is needed. During the first SAP
   Installation on FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE we tried to install PAM with all the
   required packages and finally forced the installation of the PAM package,
   which worked. For SAP R/3 4.6C SR2 we directly forced the installation of
   the PAM RPM, which also works, so it seems the dependent packages are not
   needed:

 # rpm -i --ignoreos --nodeps --root /compat/linux --dbpath /var/lib/rpm \
 pam-0.68-7.i386.rpm

   For Oracle 8.0.5 to run the intelligent agent, we also had to install the
   RedHat Tcl package tcl-8.0.5-30.i386.rpm (otherwise the relinking during
   Oracle installation will not work). There are some other issues regarding
   relinking of Oracle, but that is a Oracle Linux issue, not DragonFly
   specific.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.6.4 Some Additional Hints

   It might also be a good idea to add linprocfs to /etc/fstab, for more
   informations, see the linprocfs(5) manual page. Another parameter to set
   is kern.fallback_elf_brand=3 which is done in the file /etc/sysctl.conf.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.7 Creating the SAP R/3 Environment

    22.7.7.1 Creating the Necessary File Systems and Mountpoints

   For a simple installation, it is sufficient to create the following file
   systems:

   +------------------------------------+
   |      mount point      | size in GB |
   |-----------------------+------------|
   | /compat/linux/oracle  | 45 GB      |
   |-----------------------+------------|
   | /compat/linux/sapmnt  | 2 GB       |
   |-----------------------+------------|
   | /compat/linux/usr/sap | 2 GB       |
   +------------------------------------+

   It is also necessary to created some links. Otherwise the SAP Installer
   will complain, as it is checking the created links:

 # ln -s /compat/linux/oracle /oracle
 # ln -s /compat/linux/sapmnt /sapmnt
 # ln -s /compat/linux/usr/sap /usr/sap

   Possible error message during installation (here with System PRD and the
   SAP R/3 4.6C SR2 installation):

 INFO 2002-03-19 16:45:36 R3LINKS_IND_IND SyLinkCreate:200
     Checking existence of symbolic link /usr/sap/PRD/SYS/exe/dbg to
     /sapmnt/PRD/exe. Creating if it does not exist...

 WARNING 2002-03-19 16:45:36 R3LINKS_IND_IND SyLinkCreate:400
     Link /usr/sap/PRD/SYS/exe/dbg exists but it points to file
     /compat/linux/sapmnt/PRD/exe instead of /sapmnt/PRD/exe. The
     program cannot go on as long as this link exists at this
     location. Move the link to another location.

 ERROR 2002-03-19 16:45:36 R3LINKS_IND_IND Ins_SetupLinks:0
     can not setup link '/usr/sap/PRD/SYS/exe/dbg' with content
     '/sapmnt/PRD/exe'

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.7.2 Creating Users and Directories

   SAP R/3 needs two users and three groups. The user names depend on the SAP
   system ID (SID) which consists of three letters. Some of these SIDs are
   reserved by SAP (for example SAP and NIX. For a complete list please see
   the SAP documentation). For the IDES installation we used IDS, for the
   4.6C SR2 installation PRD, as that system is intended for production use.
   We have therefore the following groups (group IDs might differ, these are
   just the values we used with our installation):

   +-------------------------------------------------+
   | group ID | group name |       description       |
   |----------+------------+-------------------------|
   | 100      | dba        | Data Base Administrator |
   |----------+------------+-------------------------|
   | 101      | sapsys     | SAP System              |
   |----------+------------+-------------------------|
   | 102      | oper       | Data Base Operator      |
   +-------------------------------------------------+

   For a default Oracle installation, only group dba is used. As oper group,
   one also uses group dba (see Oracle and SAP documentation for further
   information).

   We also need the following users:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | user |   user name   | generic | group  | additional |   description   |
   |  ID  |               |  name   |        |   groups   |                 |
   |------+---------------+---------+--------+------------+-----------------|
   | 1000 | idsadm/prdadm | sidadm  | sapsys | oper       | SAP             |
   |      |               |         |        |            | Administrator   |
   |------+---------------+---------+--------+------------+-----------------|
   | 1002 | oraids/oraprd | orasid  | dba    | oper       | Oracle          |
   |      |               |         |        |            | Administrator   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Adding the users with adduser(8) requires the following (please note shell
   and home directory) entries for ``SAP Administrator'':

 Name: sidadm
 Password: ******
 Fullname: SAP Administrator SID
 Uid: 1000
 Gid: 101 (sapsys)
 Class:
 Groups: sapsys dba
 HOME: /home/sidadm
 Shell: bash  (/compat/linux/bin/bash)

   and for ``Oracle Administrator'':

 Name: orasid
 Password: ******
 Fullname: Oracle Administrator SID
 Uid: 1002
 Gid: 100 (dba)
 Class:
 Groups: dba
 HOME: /oracle/sid
 Shell: bash  (/compat/linux/bin/bash)

   This should also include group oper in case you are using both groups dba
   and oper.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.7.3 Creating Directories

   These directories are usually created as separate file systems. This
   depends entirely on your requirements. We choose to create them as simple
   directories, as they are all located on the same RAID 5 anyway:

   First we will set owners and rights of some directories (as user root):

 # chmod 775 /oracle
 # chmod 777 /sapmnt
 # chown root:dba /oracle
 # chown sidadm:sapsys /compat/linux/usr/sap
 # chmod 775 /compat/linux/usr/sap

   Second we will create directories as user orasid. These will all be
   subdirectories of /oracle/SID:

 # su - orasid
 # cd /oracle/SID
 # mkdir mirrlogA mirrlogB origlogA origlogB
 # mkdir sapdata1 sapdata2 sapdata3 sapdata4 sapdata5 sapdata6
 # mkdir saparch sapreorg
 # exit

   For the Oracle 8.1.7 installation some additional directories are needed:

 # su - orasid
 # cd /oracle
 # mkdir 805_32
 # mkdir client stage
 # mkdir client/80x_32
 # mkdir stage/817_32
 # cd /oracle/SID
 # mkdir 817_32

     Note: The directory client/80x_32 is used with exactly this name. Do not
     replace the x with some number or anything.

   In the third step we create directories as user sidadm:

 # su - sidadm
 # cd /usr/sap
 # mkdir SID
 # mkdir trans
 # exit

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.7.4 Entries in /etc/services

   SAP R/3 requires some entries in file /etc/services, which will not be set
   correctly during installation under FreeBSD. Please add the following
   entries (you need at least those entries corresponding to the instance
   number -- in this case, 00. It will do no harm adding all entries from 00
   to 99 for dp, gw, sp and ms). If you are going to use a SAProuter or need
   to access SAP OSS, you also need 99, as port 3299 is usually used for the
   SAProuter process on the target system:

 sapdp00    3200/tcp # SAP Dispatcher.      3200 + Instance-Number
 sapgw00  3300/tcp # SAP Gateway.         3300 + Instance-Number
 sapsp00  3400/tcp #                      3400 + Instance-Number
 sapms00  3500/tcp #                      3500 + Instance-Number

    22.7.7.5 Necessary Locales

   SAP requires at least two locales that are not part of the default RedHat
   installation. SAP offers the required RPMs as download from their FTP
   server (which is only accessible if you are a customer with OSS access).
   See note 0171356 for a list of RPMs you need.

   It is also possible to just create appropriate links (for example from
   de_DE and en_US ), but we would not recommend this for a production system
   (so far it worked with the IDES system without any problems, though). The
   following locales are needed:

 de_DE.ISO-8859-1
 en_US.ISO-8859-1

   Create the links like this:

 # cd /compat/linux/usr/share/locale
 # ln -s de_DE de_DE.ISO-8859-1
 # ln -s en_US en_US.ISO-8859-1

   If they are not present, there will be some problems during the
   installation. If these are then subsequently ignored (by setting the
   STATUS of the offending steps to OK in file CENTRDB.R3S), it will be
   impossible to log onto the SAP system without some additional effort.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.7.6 Kernel Tuning

   SAP R/3 systems need a lot of resources. We therefore added the following
   parameters to the kernel configuration file:

 # Set these for memory pigs (SAP and Oracle):
 options MAXDSIZ="(1024*1024*1024)"
 options DFLDSIZ="(1024*1024*1024)"
 # System V options needed.
 options SYSVSHM #SYSV-style shared memory
 options SHMMAXPGS=262144 #max amount of shared mem. pages
 #options SHMMAXPGS=393216 #use this for the 46C inst.parameters
 options SHMMNI=256 #max number of shared memory ident if.
 options SHMSEG=100 #max shared mem.segs per process
 options SYSVMSG #SYSV-style message queues
 options MSGSEG=32767 #max num. of mes.segments in system
 options MSGSSZ=32 #size of msg-seg. MUST be power of 2
 options MSGMNB=65535 #max char. per message queue
 options MSGTQL=2046 #max amount of msgs in system
 options SYSVSEM #SYSV-style semaphores
 options SEMMNU=256 #number of semaphore UNDO structures
 options SEMMNS=1024 #number of semaphores in system
 options SEMMNI=520 #number of semaphore identifiers
 options SEMUME=100       #number of UNDO keys

   The minimum values are specified in the documentation that comes from SAP.
   As there is no description for Linux, see the HP-UX section (32-bit) for
   further information. As the system for the 4.6C SR2 installation has more
   main memory, the shared segments can be larger both for SAP and Oracle,
   therefore choose a larger number of shared memory pages.

     Note: With the default installation of FreeBSD 4.5 on i386, leave
     MAXDSIZ and DFLDSIZ at 1 GB maximum. Otherwise, strange errors like
     ``ORA-27102: out of memory'' and ``Linux Error: 12: Cannot allocate
     memory'' might happen.

  22.7.8 Installing SAP R/3

    22.7.8.1 Preparing SAP CDROMs

   There are many CDROMs to mount and unmount during the installation.
   Assuming you have enough CDROM drives, you can just mount them all. We
   decided to copy the CDROMs contents to corresponding directories:

 /oracle/SID/sapreorg/cd-name

   where cd-name was one of KERNEL, RDBMS, EXPORT1, EXPORT2, EXPORT3,
   EXPORT4, EXPORT5 and EXPORT6 for the 4.6B/IDES installation, and KERNEL,
   RDBMS, DISK1, DISK2, DISK3, DISK4 and LANG for the 4.6C SR2 installation.
   All the filenames on the mounted CDs should be in capital letters,
   otherwise use the -g option for mounting. So use the following commands:

 # mount_cd9660 -g /dev/cd0a /mnt
 # cp -R /mnt/* /oracle/SID/sapreorg/cd-name
 # umount /mnt

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.8.2 Running the Installation Script

   First you have to prepare an install directory:

 # cd /oracle/SID/sapreorg
 # mkdir install
 # cd install

   Then the installation script is started, which will copy nearly all the
   relevant files into the install directory:

 # /oracle/SID/sapreorg/KERNEL/UNIX/INSTTOOL.SH

   The IDES installation (4.6B) comes with a fully customized SAP R/3
   demonstration system, so there are six instead of just three EXPORT CDs.
   At this point the installation template CENTRDB.R3S is for installing a
   standard central instance (R/3 and database), not the IDES central
   instance, so one needs to copy the corresponding CENTRDB.R3S from the
   EXPORT1 directory, otherwise R3SETUP will only ask for three EXPORT CDs.

   The newer SAP 4.6C SR2 release comes with four EXPORT CDs. The parameter
   file that controls the installation steps is CENTRAL.R3S. Contrary to
   earlier releases there are no separate installation templates for a
   central instance with or without database. SAP is using a separate
   template for database installation. To restart the installation later it
   is however sufficient to restart with the original file.

   During and after installation, SAP requires hostname to return the
   computer name only, not the fully qualified domain name. So either set the
   hostname accordingly, or set an alias with alias hostname='hostname -s'
   for both orasid and sidadm (and for root at least during installation
   steps performed as root). It is also possible to adjust the installed
   .profile and .login files of both users that are installed during SAP
   installation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.8.3 Start R3SETUP 4.6B

   Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly:

 # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/oracle/IDS/lib:/sapmnt/IDS/exe:/oracle/805_32/lib

   Start R3SETUP as root from installation directory:

 # cd /oracle/IDS/sapreorg/install
 # ./R3SETUP -f CENTRDB.R3S

   The script then asks some questions (defaults in brackets, followed by
   actual input):

   If you had not copied the CDs to the different locations, then the SAP
   installer cannot find the CD needed (identified by the LABEL.ASC file on
   the CD) and would then ask you to insert and mount the CD and confirm or
   enter the mount path.

   The CENTRDB.R3S might not be error free. In our case, it requested EXPORT4
   CD again but indicated the correct key (6_LOCATION, then 7_LOCATION etc.),
   so one can just continue with entering the correct values.

   Apart from some problems mentioned below, everything should go straight
   through up to the point where the Oracle database software needs to be
   installed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.8.4 Start R3SETUP 4.6C SR2

   Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly. This is a different value from
   the 4.6B installation with Oracle 8.0.5:

 # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sapmnt/PRD/exe:/oracle/PRD/817_32/lib

   Start R3SETUP as user root from installation directory:

 # cd /oracle/PRD/sapreorg/install
 # ./R3SETUP -f CENTRAL.R3S

   The script then asks some questions (defaults in brackets, followed by

   So far, creation of users gives an error during installation in phases
   OSUSERDBSID_IND_ORA (for creating user orasid) and OSUSERSIDADM_IND_ORA
   (creating user sidadm).

   Apart from some problems mentioned below, everything should go straight
   through up to the point where the Oracle database software needs to be
   installed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.9 Installing Oracle 8.0.5

   Please see the corresponding SAP Notes and Oracle Readmes regarding Linux
   and Oracle DB for possible problems. Most if not all problems stem from
   incompatible libraries.

   For more information on installing Oracle, refer to the Installing Oracle
   chapter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.9.1 Installing the Oracle 8.0.5 with orainst

   If Oracle 8.0.5 is to be used, some additional libraries are needed for
   successfully relinking, as Oracle 8.0.5 was linked with an old glibc
   (RedHat 6.0), but RedHat 6.1 already uses a new glibc. So you have to
   install the following additional packages to ensure that linking will
   work:

   compat-libs-5.2-2.i386.rpm

   compat-glibc-5.2-2.0.7.2.i386.rpm

   compat-egcs-5.2-1.0.3a.1.i386.rpm

   compat-egcs-c++-5.2-1.0.3a.1.i386.rpm

   compat-binutils-5.2-2.9.1.0.23.1.i386.rpm

   See the corresponding SAP Notes or Oracle Readmes for further information.
   If this is no option (at the time of installation we did not have enough
   time to check this), one could use the original binaries, or use the
   relinked binaries from an original RedHat system.

   For compiling the intelligent agent, the RedHat Tcl package must be
   installed. If you cannot get tcl-8.0.3-20.i386.rpm, a newer one like
   tcl-8.0.5-30.i386.rpm for RedHat 6.1 should also do.

   Apart from relinking, the installation is straightforward:

 # su - oraids
 # export TERM=xterm
 # export ORACLE_TERM=xterm
 # export ORACLE_HOME=/oracle/IDS
 # cd /ORACLE_HOME/orainst_sap
 # ./orainst

   Confirm all screens with Enter until the software is installed, except
   that one has to deselect the Oracle On-Line Text Viewer, as this is not
   currently available for Linux. Oracle then wants to relink with
   i386-glibc20-linux-gcc instead of the available gcc, egcs or
   i386-redhat-linux-gcc .

   Due to time constrains we decided to use the binaries from an Oracle 8.0.5
   PreProduction release, after the first attempt at getting the version from
   the RDBMS CD working, failed, and finding and accessing the correct RPMs
   was a nightmare at that time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.9.2 Installing the Oracle 8.0.5 Pre-production Release for Linux
    (Kernel 2.0.33)

   This installation is quite easy. Mount the CD, start the installer. It
   will then ask for the location of the Oracle home directory, and copy all
   binaries there. We did not delete the remains of our previous RDBMS
   installation tries, though.

   Afterwards, Oracle Database could be started with no problems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.10 Installing the Oracle 8.1.7 Linux Tarball

   Take the tarball oracle81732.tgz you produced from the installation
   directory on a Linux system and untar it to /oracle/SID/817_32/.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.11 Continue with SAP R/3 Installation

   First check the environment settings of users idsamd (sidadm) and oraids
   (orasid). They should now both have the files .profile, .login and .cshrc
   which are all using hostname. In case the system's hostname is the fully
   qualified name, you need to change hostname to hostname -s within all
   three files.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.11.1 Database Load

   Afterwards, R3SETUP can either be restarted or continued (depending on
   whether exit was chosen or not). R3SETUP then creates the tablespaces and
   loads the data (for 46B IDES, from EXPORT1 to EXPORT6, for 46C from DISK1
   to DISK4) with R3load into the database.

   When the database load is finished (might take a few hours), some
   passwords are requested. For test installations, one can use the well
   known default passwords (use different ones if security is an issue!):

   +------------------------------------------------------+
   |          Question           |         Input          |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Enter Password for sapr3    | sapEnter               |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Confirum Password for sapr3 | sapEnter               |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Enter Password for sys      | change_on_installEnter |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Confirm Password for sys    | change_on_installEnter |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Enter Password for system   | managerEnter           |
   |-----------------------------+------------------------|
   | Confirm Password for system | managerEnter           |
   +------------------------------------------------------+

   At this point We had a few problems with dipgntab during the 4.6B
   installation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.11.2 Listener

   Start the Oracle Listener as user orasid as follows:

 % umask 0; lsnrctl start

   Otherwise you might get the error ORA-12546 as the sockets will not have
   the correct permissions. See SAP Note 072984.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.11.3 Updating MNLS Tables

   If you plan to import non-Latin-1 languages into the SAP system, you have
   to update the Multi National Language Support tables. This is described in
   the SAP OSS Notes 15023 and 45619. Otherwise, you can skip this question
   during SAP installation.

     Note: If you do not need MNLS, it is still necessary to check the table
     TCPDB and initializing it if this has not been done. See SAP note
     0015023 and 0045619 for further information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.12 Post-installation Steps

    22.7.12.1 Request SAP R/3 License Key

   You have to request your SAP R/3 License Key. This is needed, as the
   temporary license that was installed during installation is only valid for
   four weeks. First get the hardware key. Log on as user idsadm and call
   saplicense:

 # /sapmnt/IDS/exe/saplicense -get

   Calling saplicense without parameters gives a list of options. Upon
   receiving the license key, it can be installed using:

 # /sapmnt/IDS/exe/saplicense -install

   You are then required to enter the following values:

 SAP SYSTEM ID   = SID, 3 chars
 CUSTOMER KEY    = hardware key, 11 chars
 INSTALLATION NO = installation, 10 digits
 EXPIRATION DATE = yyyymmdd, usually "99991231"
 LICENSE KEY     = license key, 24 chars

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.12.2 Creating Users

   Create a user within client 000 (for some tasks required to be done within
   client 000, but with a user different from users sap* and ddic). As a user
   name, We usually choose wartung (or service in English). Profiles required
   are sap_new and sap_all. For additional safety the passwords of default
   users within all clients should be changed (this includes users sap* and
   ddic).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.12.3 Configure Transport System, Profile, Operation Modes, Etc.

   Within client 000, user different from ddic and sap*, do at least the
   following:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                           Task                           | Transaction |
   |----------------------------------------------------------+-------------|
   | Configure Transport System, e.g. as Stand-Alone          | STMS        |
   | Transport Domain Entity                                  |             |
   |----------------------------------------------------------+-------------|
   | Create / Edit Profile for System                         | RZ10        |
   |----------------------------------------------------------+-------------|
   | Maintain Operation Modes and Instances                   | RZ04        |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   These and all the other post-installation steps are thoroughly described
   in SAP installation guides.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.12.4 Edit initsid.sap (initIDS.sap)

   The file /oracle/IDS/dbs/initIDS.sap contains the SAP backup profile. Here
   the size of the tape to be used, type of compression and so on need to be
   defined. To get this running with sapdba / brbackup, we changed the
   following values:

 compress = hardware
 archive_function = copy_delete_save
 cpio_flags = "-ov --format=newc --block-size=128 --quiet"
 cpio_in_flags = "-iuv --block-size=128 --quiet"
 tape_size = 38000M
 tape_address = /dev/nsa0
 tape_address_rew = /dev/sa0

   Explanations:

   compress: The tape we use is a HP DLT1 which does hardware compression.

   archive_function: This defines the default behavior for saving Oracle
   archive logs: new logfiles are saved to tape, already saved logfiles are
   saved again and are then deleted. This prevents lots of trouble if you
   need to recover the database, and one of the archive-tapes has gone bad.

   cpio_flags: Default is to use -B which sets block size to 5120 Bytes. For
   DLT Tapes, HP recommends at least 32 K block size, so we used
   --block-size=128 for 64 K. --format=newc is needed because we have inode
   numbers greater than 65535. The last option --quiet is needed as otherwise
   brbackup complains as soon as cpio outputs the numbers of blocks saved.

   cpio_in_flags: Flags needed for loading data back from tape. Format is
   recognized automatically.

   tape_size: This usually gives the raw storage capability of the tape. For
   security reason (we use hardware compression), the value is slightly lower
   than the actual value.

   tape_address: The non-rewindable device to be used with cpio.

   tape_address_rew: The rewindable device to be used with cpio.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.12.5 Configuration Issues after Installation

   The following SAP parameters should be tuned after installation (examples
   for IDES 46B, 1 GB memory):

           Name            Value   
   ztta/roll_extension   250000000 
   abap/heap_area_dia    300000000 
   abap/heap_area_nondia 400000000 
   em/initial_size_MB    256       
   em/blocksize_kB       1024      
   ipc/shm_psize_40      70000000  

   SAP Note 0013026:

         Name        Value  
   ztta/dynpro_area 2500000 

   SAP Note 0157246:

         Name       Value 
   rdisp/ROLL_MAXFS 16000 
   rdisp/PG_MAXFS   30000 

     Note: With the above parameters, on a system with 1 gigabyte of memory,
     one may find memory consumption similar to:

 Mem: 547M Active, 305M Inact, 109M Wired, 40M Cache, 112M Buf, 3492K Free

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.7.13 Problems during Installation

    22.7.13.1 Restart R3SETUP after Fixing a Problem

   R3SETUP stops if it encounters an error. If you have looked at the
   corresponding logfiles and fixed the error, you have to start R3SETUP
   again, usually selecting REPEAT as option for the last step R3SETUP
   complained about.

   To restart R3SETUP, just start it with the corresponding R3S file:

 # ./R3SETUP -f CENTRDB.R3S

   for 4.6B, or with

 # ./R3SETUP -f CENTRAL.R3S

   for 4.6C, no matter whether the error occurred with CENTRAL.R3S or
   DATABASE.R3S.

     Note: At some stages, R3SETUP assumes that both database and SAP
     processes are up and running (as those were steps it already completed).
     Should errors occur and for example the database could not be started,
     you have to start both database and SAP by hand after you fixed the
     errors and before starting R3SETUP again.

     Do not forget to also start the Oracle listener again (as orasid with
     umask 0; lsnrctl start) if it was also stopped (for example due to a
     necessary reboot of the system).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.2 OSUSERSIDADM_IND_ORA during R3SETUP

   If R3SETUP complains at this stage, edit the template file R3SETUP used at
   that time (CENTRDB.R3S (4.6B) or either CENTRAL.R3S or DATABASE.R3S
   (4.6C)). Locate [OSUSERSIDADM_IND_ORA] or search for the only STATUS=ERROR
   entry and edit the following values:

 HOME=/home/sidadm (was empty)
 STATUS=OK (had status ERROR)
        

   Then you can restart R3SETUP again.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.3 OSUSERDBSID_IND_ORA during R3SETUP

   Possibly R3SETUP also complains at this stage. The error here is similar
   to the one in phase OSUSERSIDADM_IND_ORA. Just edit the template file
   R3SETUP used at that time (CENTRDB.R3S (4.6B) or either CENTRAL.R3S or
   DATABASE.R3S (4.6C)). Locate [OSUSERDBSID_IND_ORA] or search for the only
   STATUS=ERROR entry and edit the following value in that section:

 STATUS=OK

   Then restart R3SETUP.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.4 ``oraview.vrf FILE NOT FOUND'' during Oracle Installation

   You have not deselected Oracle On-Line Text Viewer before starting the
   installation. This is marked for installation even though this option is
   currently not available for Linux. Deselect this product inside the Oracle
   installation menu and restart installation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.5 ``TEXTENV_INVALID'' during R3SETUP, RFC or SAPgui Start

   If this error is encountered, the correct locale is missing. SAP Note
   0171356 lists the necessary RPMs that need be installed (e.g.
   saplocales-1.0-3, saposcheck-1.0-1 for RedHat 6.1). In case you ignored
   all the related errors and set the corresponding STATUS from ERROR to OK
   (in CENTRDB.R3S) every time R3SETUP complained and just restarted R3SETUP,
   the SAP system will not be properly configured and you will then not be
   able to connect to the system with a SAPgui, even though the system can be
   started. Trying to connect with the old Linux SAPgui gave the following
   messages:

 Sat May 5 14:23:14 2001
 *** ERROR => no valid userarea given [trgmsgo. 0401]
 Sat May 5 14:23:22 2001
 *** ERROR => ERROR NR 24 occured [trgmsgi. 0410]
 *** ERROR => Error when generating text environment. [trgmsgi. 0435]
 *** ERROR => function failed [trgmsgi. 0447]
 *** ERROR => no socket operation allowed [trxio.c 3363]
 Speicherzugriffsfehler

   This behavior is due to SAP R/3 being unable to correctly assign a locale
   and also not being properly configured itself (missing entries in some
   database tables). To be able to connect to SAP, add the following entries
   to file DEFAULT.PFL (see Note 0043288):

 abap/set_etct_env_at_new_mode = 0
 install/collate/active = 0
 rscp/TCP0B = TCP0B

   Restart the SAP system. Now you can connect to the system, even though
   country-specific language settings might not work as expected. After
   correcting country settings (and providing the correct locales), these
   entries can be removed from DEFAULT.PFL and the SAP system can be
   restarted.

    22.7.13.6 ORA-00001

   This error only happened with Oracle 8.1.7 on FreeBSD 4.5. The reason was
   that the Oracle database could not initialize itself properly and crashed,
   leaving semaphores and shared memory on the system. The next try to start
   the database then returned ORA-00001.

   Find them with ipcs -a and remove them with ipcrm.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.7 ORA-00445 (Background Process PMON Did Not Start)

   This error happened with Oracle 8.1.7. This error is reported if the
   database is started with the usual startsap script (for example
   startsap_majestix_00) as user prdadm.

   A possible workaround is to start the database as user oraprd instead with
   svrmgrl:

 % svrmgrl
 SVRMGR> connect internal;
 SVRMGR> startup;
 SVRMGR> exit

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.8 ORA-12546 (Start Listener with Correct Permissions)

   Start the Oracle listener as user oraids with the following commands:

 # umask 0; lsnrctl start

   Otherwise you might get ORA-12546 as the sockets will not have the correct
   permissions. See SAP Note 0072984.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.9 ORA-27102 (Out of Memory)

   This error happened whilst trying to use values for MAXDSIZ and DFLDSIZ
   greater than 1 GB (1024x1024x1024). Additionally, we got ``Linux Error 12:
   Cannot allocate memory''.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.10 [DIPGNTAB_IND_IND] during R3SETUP

   In general, see SAP Note 0130581 (R3SETUP step DIPGNTAB terminates).
   During the IDES-specific installation, for some reasons the installation
   process was not using the proper SAP system name ``IDS'', but the empty
   string "" instead. This lead to some minor problems with accessing
   directories, as the paths are generated dynamically using SID (in this
   case IDS). So instead of accessing:

 /usr/sap/IDS/SYS/...
 /usr/sap/IDS/DVMGS00

   the following paths were used:

 /usr/sap//SYS/...
 /usr/sap/D00

   To continue with the installation, we created a link and an additional
   directory:

 # pwd
 /compat/linux/usr/sap
 # ls -l
 total 4
 drwxr-xr-x 3  idsadm sapsys 512 May 5 11:20 D00
 drwxr-x--x 5  idsadm sapsys 512 May 5 11:35 IDS
 lrwxr-xr-x 1  root   sapsys 7 May 5 11:35 SYS -> IDS/SYS
 drwxrwxr-x 2  idsadm sapsys 512 May 5 13:00 tmp
 drwxrwxr-x 11 idsadm sapsys 512 May 4 14:20 trans

   We also found SAP Notes (0029227 and 0008401) describing this behavior. We
   did not encounter any of these problems with the SAP 4.6C installation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.11 [RFCRSWBOINI_IND_IND] during R3SETUP

   During installation of SAP 4.6C, this error was just the result of another
   error happening earlier during installation. In this case, you have to
   look through the corresponding logfiles and correct the real problem.

   If after looking through the logfiles this error is indeed the correct one
   (check the SAP Notes), you can set STATUS of the offending step from ERROR
   to OK (file CENTRDB.R3S) and restart R3SETUP. After installation, you have
   to execute the report RSWBOINS from transaction SE38. See SAP Note 0162266
   for additional information about phase RFCRSWBOINI and RFCRADDBDIF.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.12 [RFCRADDBDIF_IND_IND] during R3SETUP

   Here the same restrictions apply: make sure by looking through the
   logfiles, that this error is not caused by some previous problems.

   If you can confirm that SAP Note 0162266 applies, just set STATUS of the
   offending step from ERROR to OK (file CENTRDB.R3S) and restart R3SETUP.
   After installation, you have to execute the report RADDBDIF from
   transaction SE38.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.13 sigaction sig31: File size limit exceeded

   This error occurred during start of SAP processes disp+work. If starting
   SAP with the startsap script, subprocesses are then started which detach
   and do the dirty work of starting all other SAP processes. As a result,
   the script itself will not notice if something goes wrong.

   To check whether the SAP processes did start properly, have a look at the
   process status with ps ax | grep SID, which will give you a list of all
   Oracle and SAP processes. If it looks like some processes are missing or
   if you cannot connect to the SAP system, look at the corresponding
   logfiles which can be found at /usr/sap/SID/DVEBMGSnr/work/. The files to
   look at are dev_ms and dev_disp.

   Signal 31 happens here if the amount of shared memory used by Oracle and
   SAP exceed the one defined within the kernel configuration file and could
   be resolved by using a larger value:

 # larger value for 46C production systems:
 options SHMMAXPGS=393216
 # smaller value sufficient for 46B:
 #options SHMMAXPGS=262144

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    22.7.13.14 Start of saposcol Failed

   There are some problems with the program saposcol (version 4.6D). The SAP
   system is using saposcol to collect data about the system performance.
   This program is not needed to use the SAP system, so this problem can be
   considered a minor one. The older versions (4.6B) does work, but does not
   collect all the data (many calls will just return 0, for example for CPU
   usage).

22.8 Advanced Topics

   If you are curious as to how the Linux binary compatibility works, this is
   the section you want to read. Most of what follows is based heavily on an
   email written to FreeBSD chat mailing list by Terry Lambert
   <tlambert@primenet.com> (Message ID:
   <199906020108.SAA07001@usr09.primenet.com>).

     Warning: This description applies to FreeBSD, for which it was
     originally written. This may or may not apply to DragonFly at this
     point; while FreeBSD 4.x features usually translate over to DragonFly
     well, your mileage may vary.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  22.8.1 How Does It Work?

   DragonFly has an abstraction called an ``execution class loader''. This is
   a wedge into the execve(2) system call.

   What happens is that DragonFly has a list of loaders, instead of a single
   loader with a fallback to the #! loader for running any shell interpreters
   or shell scripts.

   Historically, the only loader on the UNIX platform examined the magic
   number (generally the first 4 or 8 bytes of the file) to see if it was a
   binary known to the system, and if so, invoked the binary loader.

   If it was not the binary type for the system, the execve(2) call returned
   a failure, and the shell attempted to start executing it as shell
   commands.

   The assumption was a default of ``whatever the current shell is''.

   Later, a hack was made for sh(1) to examine the first two characters, and
   if they were :\n, then it invoked the csh(1) shell instead (we believe SCO
   first made this hack).

   What DragonFly does now is go through a list of loaders, with a generic #!
   loader that knows about interpreters as the characters which follow to the
   next whitespace next to last, followed by a fallback to /bin/sh.

   For the Linux ABI support, DragonFly sees the magic number as an ELF
   binary (it makes no distinction between FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux, or any
   other OS which has an ELF image type, at this point).

   The ELF loader looks for a specialized brand, which is a comment section
   in the ELF image, and which is not present on SVR4/Solaris ELF binaries.

   For Linux binaries to function, they must be branded as type Linux from
   brandelf(1):

 # brandelf -t Linux file

   When this is done, the ELF loader will see the Linux brand on the file.

   When the ELF loader sees the Linux brand, the loader replaces a pointer in
   the proc structure. All system calls are indexed through this pointer (in
   a traditional UNIX system, this would be the sysent[] structure array,
   containing the system calls). In addition, the process is flagged for
   special handling of the trap vector for the signal trampoline code, and
   several other (minor) fix-ups that are handled by the Linux kernel module.

   The Linux system call vector contains, among other things, a list of
   sysent[] entries whose addresses reside in the kernel module.

   When a system call is called by the Linux binary, the trap code
   dereferences the system call function pointer off the proc structure, and
   gets the Linux, not the DragonFly, system call entry points.

   In addition, the Linux mode dynamically reroots lookups; this is, in
   effect, what the union option to file system mounts (not the unionfs file
   system type!) does. First, an attempt is made to lookup the file in the
   /compat/linux/original-path directory, then only if that fails, the lookup
   is done in the /original-path directory. This makes sure that binaries
   that require other binaries can run (e.g., the Linux toolchain can all run
   under Linux ABI support). It also means that the Linux binaries can load
   and execute DragonFly binaries, if there are no corresponding Linux
   binaries present, and that you could place a uname(1) command in the
   /compat/linux directory tree to ensure that the Linux binaries could not
   tell they were not running on Linux.

   In effect, there is a Linux kernel in the DragonFly kernel; the various
   underlying functions that implement all of the services provided by the
   kernel are identical to both the DragonFly system call table entries, and
   the Linux system call table entries: file system operations, virtual
   memory operations, signal delivery, System V IPC, etc... The only
   difference is that DragonFly binaries get the DragonFly glue functions,
   and Linux binaries get the Linux glue functions (most older OS's only had
   their own glue functions: addresses of functions in a static global
   sysent[] structure array, instead of addresses of functions dereferenced
   off a dynamically initialized pointer in the proc structure of the process
   making the call).

   Which one is the native DragonFly ABI? It does not matter. Basically the
   only difference is that (currently; this could easily be changed in a
   future release, and probably will be after this) the DragonFly glue
   functions are statically linked into the kernel, and the Linux glue
   functions can be statically linked, or they can be accessed via a kernel
   module.

   Yeah, but is this really emulation? No. It is an ABI implementation, not
   an emulation. There is no emulator (or simulator, to cut off the next
   question) involved.

   So why is it sometimes called ``Linux emulation''? To make it hard to sell
   DragonFly! Really, it is because the historical implementation was done at
   a time when there was really no word other than that to describe what was
   going on; saying that FreeBSD [14] ran Linux binaries was not true, if you
   did not compile the code in or load a module, and there needed to be a
   word to describe what was being loaded--hence ``the Linux emulator''.

A.2 FTP Sites

   The official sources for DragonFly are available via anonymous FTP from a
   worldwide set of mirror sites. The site ftp://ftp.dragonflybsd.org/ is
   well connected and allows a large number of connections to it, but you are
   probably better off finding a ``closer'' mirror site (especially if you
   decide to set up some sort of mirror site).

   The DragonFly mirror sites list is the best, most up-to-date source.

   Additionally, DragonFly is available via anonymous FTP from the following
   mirror sites. If you choose to obtain DragonFly via anonymous FTP, please
   try to use a site near you. The mirror sites listed as ``Primary Mirror
   Sites'' typically have the entire DragonFly archive (all the currently
   available versions for each of the architectures) but you will probably
   have faster download times from a site that is in your country or region.
   The regional sites carry the most recent versions for the most popular
   architecture(s) but might not carry the entire DragonFly archive. All
   sites provide access via anonymous FTP but some sites also provide access
   via other methods. The access methods available for each site are provided
   in parentheses after the hostname.

A.3 Using CVSup

  A.3.1 Introduction

   CVSup is a software package for distributing and updating source trees
   from a master CVS repository on a remote server host. The DragonFly
   sources are maintained in a CVS repository on a central development
   machine in California. With CVSup, DragonFly users can easily keep their
   own source trees up to date.

   CVSup uses the so-called pull model of updating. Under the pull model,
   each client asks the server for updates, if and when they are wanted. The
   server waits passively for update requests from its clients. Thus all
   updates are instigated by the client. The server never sends unsolicited
   updates. Users must either run the CVSup client manually to get an update,
   or they must set up a cron job to run it automatically on a regular basis.

   The term CVSup, capitalized just so, refers to the entire software
   package. Its main components are the client cvsup which runs on each
   user's machine, and the server cvsupd which runs at each of the DragonFly
   mirror sites that use CVSup.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.2 Installation

   CVSup is installed by default on all DragonFly systems.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.3 CVSup Configuration

   CVSup's operation is controlled by a configuration file called the
   supfile. There are some sample supfiles in the directory
   /usr/share/examples/cvsup/.

   The information in a supfile answers the following questions for CVSup:

     * Which files do you want to receive?

     * Which versions of them do you want?

     * Where do you want to get them from?

     * Where do you want to put them on your own machine?

     * Where do you want to put your status files?

   In the following sections, we will construct a typical supfile by
   answering each of these questions in turn. First, we describe the overall
   structure of a supfile.

   A supfile is a text file. Comments begin with # and extend to the end of
   the line. Lines that are blank and lines that contain only comments are
   ignored.

   Each remaining line describes a set of files that the user wishes to
   receive. The line begins with the name of a ``collection'', a logical
   grouping of files defined by the server. The name of the collection tells
   the server which files you want. After the collection name come zero or
   more fields, separated by white space. These fields answer the questions
   listed above. There are two types of fields: flag fields and value fields.
   A flag field consists of a keyword standing alone, e.g., delete or
   compress. A value field also begins with a keyword, but the keyword is
   followed without intervening white space by = and a second word. For
   example, release=cvs is a value field.

   A supfile typically specifies more than one collection to receive. One way
   to structure a supfile is to specify all of the relevant fields explicitly
   for each collection. However, that tends to make the supfile lines quite
   long, and it is inconvenient because most fields are the same for all of
   the collections in a supfile. CVSup provides a defaulting mechanism to
   avoid these problems. Lines beginning with the special pseudo-collection
   name *default can be used to set flags and values which will be used as
   defaults for the subsequent collections in the supfile. A default value
   can be overridden for an individual collection, by specifying a different
   value with the collection itself. Defaults can also be changed or
   augmented in mid-supfile by additional *default lines.

   With this background, we will now proceed to construct a supfile for
   receiving and updating the main source tree of DragonFly.

     * Which files do you want to receive?

       The files available via CVSup are organized into named groups called
       ``collections''. The collections that are available are described in
       the following section. In this example, we wish to receive the entire
       main source tree for the DragonFly system. There is a single large
       collection cvs-src which will give us all of that. As a first step
       toward constructing our supfile, we simply list the collections, one
       per line (in this case, only one line):

 cvs-src

     * Which version(s) of them do you want?

       With CVSup, you can receive virtually any version of the sources that
       ever existed. That is possible because the cvsupd server works
       directly from the CVS repository, which contains all of the versions.
       You specify which one of them you want using the tag= and date= value
       fields.

         Warning: Be very careful to specify any tag= fields correctly. Some
         tags are valid only for certain collections of files. If you specify
         an incorrect or misspelled tag, CVSup will delete files which you
         probably do not want deleted. In particular, use only tag=. for the
         ports-* collections.

       The tag= field names a symbolic tag in the repository. There are two
       kinds of tags, revision tags and branch tags. A revision tag refers to
       a specific revision. Its meaning stays the same from day to day. A
       branch tag, on the other hand, refers to the latest revision on a
       given line of development, at any given time. Because a branch tag
       does not refer to a specific revision, it may mean something different
       tomorrow than it means today.

       Section A.4 contains branch tags that users might be interested in.
       When specifying a tag in CVSup's configuration file, it must be
       preceded with tag= (RELENG_4 will become tag=RELENG_4). Keep in mind
       that only the tag=. is relevant for the ports collection.

         Warning: Be very careful to type the tag name exactly as shown.
         CVSup cannot distinguish between valid and invalid tags. If you
         misspell the tag, CVSup will behave as though you had specified a
         valid tag which happens to refer to no files at all. It will delete
         your existing sources in that case.

       When you specify a branch tag, you normally receive the latest
       versions of the files on that line of development. If you wish to
       receive some past version, you can do so by specifying a date with the
       date= value field. The cvsup(1) manual page explains how to do that.

       For our example, we wish to receive the current release of DragonFly.
       We add this line at the beginning of our supfile:

 *default tag=.

       There is an important special case that comes into play if you specify
       neither a tag= field nor a date= field. In that case, you receive the
       actual RCS files directly from the server's CVS repository, rather
       than receiving a particular version. Developers generally prefer this
       mode of operation. By maintaining a copy of the repository itself on
       their systems, they gain the ability to browse the revision histories
       and examine past versions of files. This gain is achieved at a large
       cost in terms of disk space, however.

     * Where do you want to get them from?

       We use the host= field to tell cvsup where to obtain its updates. Any
       of the CVSup mirror sites will do, though you should try to select one
       that is close to you in cyberspace. In this example we will use a
       fictional DragonFly distribution site, cvsup666.dragonflybsd.org:

 *default host=cvsup666.dragonflybsd.org

       You will need to change the host to one that actually exists before
       running CVSup. On any particular run of cvsup, you can override the
       host setting on the command line, with -h hostname.

     * Where do you want to put them on your own machine?

       The prefix= field tells cvsup where to put the files it receives. In
       this example, we will put the source files directly into our main
       source tree, /usr/src. The src directory is already implicit in the
       collections we have chosen to receive, so this is the correct
       specification:

 *default prefix=/usr

     * Where should cvsup maintain its status files?

       The CVSup client maintains certain status files in what is called the
       ``base'' directory. These files help CVSup to work more efficiently,
       by keeping track of which updates you have already received. We will
       use the standard base directory, /usr/local/etc/cvsup:

 *default base=/usr/local/etc/cvsup

       This setting is used by default if it is not specified in the supfile,
       so we actually do not need the above line.

       If your base directory does not already exist, now would be a good
       time to create it. The cvsup client will refuse to run if the base
       directory does not exist.

     * Miscellaneous supfile settings:

       There is one more line of boiler plate that normally needs to be
       present in the supfile:

 *default release=cvs delete use-rel-suffix compress

       release=cvs indicates that the server should get its information out
       of the main DragonFly CVS repository. This is virtually always the
       case, but there are other possibilities which are beyond the scope of
       this discussion.

       delete gives CVSup permission to delete files. You should always
       specify this, so that CVSup can keep your source tree fully
       up-to-date. CVSup is careful to delete only those files for which it
       is responsible. Any extra files you happen to have will be left
       strictly alone.

       use-rel-suffix is ... arcane. If you really want to know about it, see
       the cvsup(1) manual page. Otherwise, just specify it and do not worry
       about it.

       compress enables the use of gzip-style compression on the
       communication channel. If your network link is T1 speed or faster, you
       probably should not use compression. Otherwise, it helps
       substantially.

     * Putting it all together:

       Here is the entire supfile for our example:

 *default tag=.
 *default host=cvsup666.dragonflybsd.org
 *default prefix=/usr
 *default base=/usr/local/etc/cvsup
 *default release=cvs delete use-rel-suffix compress

 src-all

   As mentioned above, CVSup uses a pull method. Basically, this means that
   you connect to the CVSup server, and it says, ``Here is what you can
   download from me...'', and your client responds ``OK, I will take this,
   this, this, and this.'' In the default configuration, the CVSup client
   will take every file associated with the collection and tag you chose in
   the configuration file. However, this is not always what you want,
   especially if you are synching the doc, ports, or www trees -- most people
   cannot read four or five languages, and therefore they do not need to
   download the language-specific files. If you are CVSuping the ports
   collection, you can get around this by specifying each collection
   individually (e.g., ports-astrology, ports-biology, etc instead of simply
   saying ports-all). However, since the doc and www trees do not have
   language-specific collections, you must use one of CVSup's many nifty
   features: the refuse file.

   The refuse file essentially tells CVSup that it should not take every
   single file from a collection; in other words, it tells the client to
   refuse certain files from the server. The refuse file can be found (or, if
   you do not yet have one, should be placed) in base/sup/. base is defined
   in your supfile; by default, base is /usr/local/etc/cvsup, which means
   that by default the refuse file is /usr/local/etc/cvsup/sup/refuse.

   The refuse file has a very simple format; it simply contains the names of
   files or directories that you do not wish to download. For example, if you
   cannot speak any languages other than English and some German, and you do
   not feel the need to use the German applications (or applications for any
   other languages, except for English), you can put the following in your
   refuse file:

 ports/chinese
 ports/french
 ports/german
 ports/hebrew
 ports/hungarian
 ports/japanese
 ports/korean
 ports/polish
 ports/portuguese
 ports/russian
 ports/ukrainian
 ports/vietnamese
 doc/da_*
 doc/de_*
 doc/el_*
 doc/es_*
 doc/fr_*
 doc/it_*
 doc/ja_*
 doc/nl_*
 doc/no_*
 doc/pl_*
 doc/pt_*
 doc/ru_*
 doc/sr_*
 doc/zh_*

   and so forth for the other languages (you can find the full list by
   browsing the FreeBSD CVS repository).

   With this very useful feature, those users who are on slow links or pay by
   the minute for their Internet connection will be able to save valuable
   time as they will no longer need to download files that they will never
   use. For more information on refuse files and other neat features of
   CVSup, please view its manual page.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.4 Running CVSup

   You are now ready to try an update. The command line for doing this is
   quite simple:

 # cvsup supfile

   where supfile is of course the name of the supfile you have just created.
   Assuming you are running under X11, cvsup will display a GUI window with
   some buttons to do the usual things. Press the go button, and watch it
   run.

   Since you are updating your actual /usr/src tree in this example, you will
   need to run the program as root so that cvsup has the permissions it needs
   to update your files. Having just created your configuration file, and
   having never used this program before, that might understandably make you
   nervous. There is an easy way to do a trial run without touching your
   precious files. Just create an empty directory somewhere convenient, and
   name it as an extra argument on the command line:

 # mkdir /var/tmp/dest
 # cvsup supfile /var/tmp/dest

   The directory you specify will be used as the destination directory for
   all file updates. CVSup will examine your usual files in /usr/src, but it
   will not modify or delete any of them. Any file updates will instead land
   in /var/tmp/dest/usr/src. CVSup will also leave its base directory status
   files untouched when run this way. The new versions of those files will be
   written into the specified directory. As long as you have read access to
   /usr/src, you do not even need to be root to perform this kind of trial
   run.

   If you are not running X11 or if you just do not like GUIs, you should add
   a couple of options to the command line when you run cvsup:

 # cvsup -g -L 2 supfile

   The -g tells CVSup not to use its GUI. This is automatic if you are not
   running X11, but otherwise you have to specify it.

   The -L 2 tells CVSup to print out the details of all the file updates it
   is doing. There are three levels of verbosity, from -L 0 to -L 2. The
   default is 0, which means total silence except for error messages.

   There are plenty of other options available. For a brief list of them,
   type cvsup -H. For more detailed descriptions, see the manual page.

   Once you are satisfied with the way updates are working, you can arrange
   for regular runs of CVSup using cron(8). Obviously, you should not let
   CVSup use its GUI when running it from cron(8).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.5 CVSup File Collections

   The most commonly used collections are cvs-src, and cvs-dfports.

   cvs-src

           The DragonFly source code.

   cvs-doc

           Documentation. This does not include the DragonFly website.

   cvs-dfports

           Overrides for the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

   cvs-site

           The DragonFly website code.

   cvs-root

           Basic CVS data. This is only needed if you are pulling the RCS
           data.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.6 For More Information

   For the CVSup FAQ and other information about CVSup, see The CVSup Home
   Page.

   Questions and bug reports should be addressed to the author of the program
   at <cvsup-bugs@polstra.com>.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.3.7 CVSup Sites

   CVSup servers for DragonFly are running at the following sites:

   Primary Mirror Sites, Australia, USA.

   (as of 2005/06/27 23:37:47 UTC)

   Primary Mirror Sites

              * chlamydia.fs.ei.tum.de

              * cvsup.allbsd.org

              * grappa.unix-ag.uni-kl.de

              * mirror.isp.net.au

              * alxl.info

              * dragonflybsd.delphij.net

              * fred.acm.cs.rpi.edu

   Australia

              * mirror.isp.net.au

   USA

              * fred.acm.cs.rpi.edu

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A.4 CVS Tags

   When obtaining or updating sources from cvs and CVSup a revision tag
   (reference to a date in time) must be specified.

   A revision tag refers to either a particular line of DragonFly
   development, or a specific point in time. The first type are called
   ``branch tags'', the second type are called ``release tags''.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.4.1 Branch Tags

   The DragonFly tree has no branch tags at the current time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A.4.2 Release Tags

   These tags correspond to the DragonFly src/ tree at a specific point in
   time, when a particular version was released.

   HEAD

           The latest bleeding-edge DragonFly code. Be warned that this is
           considered unstable and possibly may not build or compile at any
           time.

   DragonFly_Preview

           A "preview" of the latest bleeding-edge DragonFly code. The main
           purpose of the Preview tag is to support those users who want a
           fairly recent snapshot at a "reasonably stable" point in
           development. Under normal conditions, one should consider syncing
           Preview at least once a month.

   DragonFly_RELEASE_1_2

           DragonFly 1.2

   DragonFly_1_0_REL

           DragonFly 1.0

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Appendix B. Bibliography

   While the manual pages provide the definitive reference for individual
   pieces of the DragonFly operating system, they are notorious for not
   illustrating how to put the pieces together to make the whole operating
   system run smoothly. For this, there is no substitute for a good book on
   UNIX system administration and a good users' manual.

                     Appendix C. Resources on the Internet

   The rapid pace of DragonFly progress makes print media impractical as a
   means of following the latest developments. Electronic resources are the
   best, if not often the only, way stay informed of the latest advances.
   Since DragonFly is a volunteer effort, the user community itself also
   generally serves as a ``technical support department'' of sorts, with
   electronic mail and USENET news being the most effective way of reaching
   that community.

   The most important points of contact with the DragonFly user community are
   outlined below. If you are aware of other resources not mentioned here,
   please send them to the DragonFly Documentation project mailing list so
   that they may also be included.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

C.1 Mailing Lists

   Though many of the DragonFly development members read USENET, we cannot
   always guarantee that we will get to your questions in a timely fashion
   (or at all) if you post them only to one of the comp.unix.bsd.* groups. By
   addressing your questions to the appropriate mailing list you will reach
   both us and a concentrated DragonFly audience, invariably assuring a
   better (or at least faster) response.

   The charters for the various lists are given at the bottom of this
   document. Please read the charter before joining or sending mail to any
   list. Most of our list subscribers now receive many hundreds of DragonFly
   related messages every day, and by setting down charters and rules for
   proper use we are striving to keep the signal-to-noise ratio of the lists
   high. To do less would see the mailing lists ultimately fail as an
   effective communications medium for the project.

   Archives are kept for all of the mailing lists and can be searched using
   the mail archives. The keyword searchable archive offers an excellent way
   of finding answers to frequently asked questions and should be consulted
   before posting a question.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  C.1.1 List Summary

   General lists: The following are general lists which anyone is free (and

  C.1.2 How to Subscribe

   To subscribe to a list, click on the list name above or send an email to
   <listname-request@dragonflybsd.org> and put 'subscribe' in the body of the
   message.

   To actually post to a given list you simply send mail to
   <listname@dragonflybsd.org>. It will then be redistributed to mailing list
   members world-wide.

   To unsubscribe yourself from a list, email
   <listname-request@dragonflybsd.org> and put 'unsubscribe' in the body of
   the message.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  C.1.3 List Charters

   All DragonFly mailing lists have certain basic rules which must be adhered
   to by anyone using them. Failure to comply with these guidelines may
   result in from all DragonFly mailing lists and filtered from further
   posting to them. We regret that such rules and measures are necessary at
   all, but today's Internet is a pretty harsh environment, it would seem,
   and many fail to appreciate just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.

   Rules of the road:

     * The topic of any posting should adhere to the basic charter of the
       list it is posted to, e.g. if the list is about technical issues then
       your posting should contain technical discussion. Ongoing irrelevant
       chatter or flaming only detracts from the value of the mailing list
       for everyone on it and will not be tolerated.

     * No posting should be made to more than two mailing lists, and only to
       two when a clear and obvious need to post to both lists exists. For
       most lists, there is already a great deal of subscriber overlap. If a
       message is sent to you in such a way that multiple mailing lists
       appear on the Cc line then the Cc line should also be trimmed before
       sending it out again. You are still responsible for your own
       cross-postings, no matter who the originator might have been.

     * Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument) are not
       allowed, and that includes users and developers alike. Gross breaches
       of netiquette, like excerpting or reposting private mail when
       permission to do so was not and would not be forthcoming, are frowned
       upon but not specifically enforced. However, there are also very few
       cases where such content would fit within the charter of a list and it
       would therefore probably rate a warning (or ban) on that basis alone.

     * Advertising of non-DragonFly related products or services is strictly
       prohibited and will result in an immediate ban if it is clear that the
       offender is advertising by spam.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  C.1.4 Filtering on the Mailing Lists

   The DragonFly mailing lists are filtered in multiple ways to avoid the
   distribution of spam, viruses, and other unwanted emails. The filtering
   actions described in this section do not include all those used to protect
   the mailing lists.

   Only certain types of attachments are allowed on the mailing lists. All
   attachments with a MIME content type not found in the list below will be
   stripped before an email is distributed on the mailing lists.

     * application/octet-stream

     * application/pdf

     * application/pgp-signature

     * application/x-pkcs7-signature

     * message/rfc822

     * multipart/alternative

     * multipart/related

     * multipart/signed

     * text/html

     * text/plain

     * text/x-diff

     * text/x-patch

     Note: Some of the mailing lists might allow attachments of other MIME
     content types, but the above list should be applicable for most of the
     mailing lists.

   If an email contains both an HTML and a plain text version, the HTML
   version will be removed. If an email contains only an HTML version, it
   will be converted to plain text.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

C.2 Usenet Newsgroups

   All the DragonFly mailing lists are duplicated as newsgroups, served at
   nntp.dragonflybsd.org.

   In addition to these newsgroups, there are many others in which DragonFly
   is discussed or are otherwise relevant to DragonFly users. Keyword
   searchable archives are available for some of these newsgroups from
   courtesy of Warren Toomey <wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au>.

                                    Colophon

   This book is the combined work of hundreds of contributors to ``The
   FreeBSD Documentation Project'' and the ``The DragonFly BSD Documentation
   Project''. The text is authored in SGML according to the DocBook DTD and
   is formatted from SGML into many different presentation formats using
   Jade, an open source DSSSL engine. Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were
   used with an additional customization layer to provide the presentation
   instructions for Jade. The printed version of this document would not be
   possible without Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting language, Leslie Lamport's
   LaTeX, or Sebastian Rahtz's JadeTeX macro package.

  Notes

   [1]  This is what i386 means. Note that even if you are not running        
        DragonFly on an Intel 386 CPU, this is going to be i386. It is not    
        the type of your processor, but the processor ``architecture'' that   
        is shown here.                                                        
   [2]  Startup scripts are programs that are run automatically by DragonFly  
        when booting. Their main function is to set things up for everything  
        else to run, and start any services that you have configured to run   
        in the background doing useful things.                                
   [3]  A fairly technical and accurate description of all the details of the 
        DragonFly console and keyboard drivers can be found in the manual     
        pages of syscons(4), atkbd(4), vidcontrol(1) and kbdcontrol(1). We    
        will not expand on the details here, but the interested reader can    
        always consult the manual pages for a more detailed and thorough      
        explanation of how things work.                                       
   [4]  Not quite true--there are a few things that can not be interrupted.   
        For example, if the process is trying to read from a file that is on  
        another computer on the network, and the other computer has gone away 
        for some reason (been turned off, or the network has a fault), then   
        the process is said to be ``uninterruptible''. Eventually the process 
        will time out, typically after two minutes. As soon as this time out  
        occurs the process will be killed.                                    
   [5]  Previously this was used to define *BSD dependent features.           
   [6]  Well, unless you hook up multiple terminals, but we will save that    
        for Chapter 17.                                                       
   [7]  It is possible to use UID/GIDs as large as 4294967295, but such IDs   
        can cause serious problems with software that makes assumptions about 
        the values of IDs.                                                    
   [8]  The -s makes adduser(8) default to quiet. We use -v later when we     
        want to change defaults.                                              
   [9]  The auto-tuning algorithm sets maxuser equal to the amount of memory  
        in the system, with a minimum of 32, and a maximum of 384.            
   [10] Under DragonFly the standard login password may be up to 128          
        characters in length.                                                 
   [11] RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks and offers       
        various forms of fault tolerance, though the latter term is somewhat  
        misleading: it provides no redundancy.                                
   [12] A popular familiar graphics card with generally very good XFree86     
        performance, nVidia, has yet to release the specifications on their   
        XVideo support to the XFree86 team. It may be some time before        
        XFree86 fully support XVideo for these cards.                         
   [13] Unauthorized DVD playback is a serious criminal act in some           
        countries. Check local laws before enabling this option.              
   [14] FreeBSD's original Linux compatibility code was committed in June     
        1995. It fulfilled milestone number one: running DOOM.
