	How to add your key to the list
	===============================

The addkey.sh script will export your key and generate the correct
SGML incantations to have your key listed in the "PGP Keys" chapter.
It was written for GnuPG, but shouldn't be difficult to modify to use
PGP if you absolutely won't use GnuPG.

For addkey.sh to perform its magic, gpg must be in your path, and the
key(s) you wish to export must be present in the default keyring or in
a keyring listed in your ~/.gnupg/options file.

The simplest case is when your login name (as reported by 'id -nu') is
the same as your freefall login name, and all the keys you wish to add
(and only those keys) have a UID that contains your FreeBSD.org email
address.  For instance, in my case:

| % sh addkey.sh
| Retrieving key...
| pub  1024D/27848427 2000-10-13 Dag-Erling Smørgrav (low security key) <des@dragonfly.org>
| pub  1024D/0512E49A 2001-06-26 Dag-Erling Smørgrav (FreeBSD) <des@dragonfly.org>
| WARNING: Multiple keys; exporting all.  If this is not what you want,
| WARNING: you should specify a key ID on the command line.
| Generating des.key...
| Adding key to entity list...
| 
| Unless you are already listed there, you should now add the
| following text to
| usr/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/pgpkeys/chapter.sgml in the
| appropriate position in
| the developer section (unless this is a role key or you are a
| core member.)  Remember to keep the list sorted by last name!
| 
|     <sect2 id="pgpkey-des">
|       <title>&a.des;</title>
|       &pgpkey.des;
|     </sect2>
| 
| Don't forget to 'cvs add des.key' if this is a new entry,
| and check your diffs before committing!

If your login name is different from your freefall login name, specify
your freefall login name as the first argument to addkey.sh:

| % sh addkey.sh des

If you want to tune what keys are to be exported, specify the key IDs,
or strings to look for in the UID, just like you would to gpg:

| % sh addkey.sh des 0512E49A

You can specify as few or as many IDs as you want, and addkey.sh will
export all matching keys, and those only.  If you didn't specify any
key IDs on the command line, addkey.sh will look for a key that
matches your FreeBSD.org email address.

The script will generate a file named <freefall-login>.key (des.key in
my case) that with programlisting elements: one that contains the
fingerprints of all the keys you exported, and one that contains an
ASCII dump of those keys, as produced by 'gpg --armor --export'.  It
will also add a line to pgpkeys.ent defining an external entity named
pgpkey.<freefall-login> (pgpkey.des in my case) that refers to the key
file.

As you can see from the example above, addkey.sh will also tell you
what keys it exported (check this carefully before committing!) and
provide instructions for actually adding the key to the handbook.
Beware that the keys are supposed to be ordered by surname; if you're
unsure where to add your entry, use finger(1) to check the surnames of
those around you.

Once you've successfully run addkey.sh, 'cvs add' your key file, check
the diffs, and commit.


	How to update your key
	======================

There are two ways to update your key.  The first is to follow the
above instructions as if you were adding your key for the first time -
except that you don't need to edit chapter.sgml, because you're
already listed there.  The addkey.sh script will snarf the RCS Id from
the old key file and generate a new one with whatever keys you
specified.

The second method, which you can use if you're not adding or removing
any keys, but just updating the ones that are already there (because
you've had your key signed, or you've added or removed UIDs), is to
execute the third line of your key file, which is a pre-cooked
addkey.sh command line with your freefall login and the numeric key
IDs of the keys contained in the file.  Just do the equivalent of:

| % eval $(grep addkey des.key)

The exact command, of course, will depend on your shell, and on your
freefall login name.
