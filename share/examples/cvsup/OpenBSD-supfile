# OPENBSD-CVS-SUPFILE
#
# This file will by default maintain a copy of the OpenBSD CVS tree in
# /home/obcvs
#
# A list of OpenBSD CVSup mirrors is available at:
#
#	http://www.openbsd.org/cvsup.html#CVSROOT
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 openbsd-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=<mirror_site>
#		This specifies the server host which will supply the
#		file updates.
#
# base=/usr
#		This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  You can override the "base" setting on the
#		command line with cvsup's "-b base" option.  This directory
#		must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/home/obcvs
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/home/obcvs" will place all of the files
#		requested in /home/obcvs (e.g., "/home/obcvs/src/bin",
#		"/home/obcvs/ports/archivers").  The prefix directory
#		must exist in order to run CVSup.
