.Dt COMPILERS.CONF 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm compilers.conf
.Nd configuration file for external compilers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /etc/compilers.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file allows to configure
.Dq external
compilers for usage with the
.Dx
.Xr build 7
system.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/defaults/compilers.conf
file specifies the default settings for all variables, the
.Pa /etc/compilers.conf
file specifies override settings.
.Pp
The following variables are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va <version>_CPPFLAGS"
.It Va <version>_CC
The pathname of the
.Nm cc
program of the compiler.
.It Va <version>_CFLAGS
Any additional flags to pass to
.Va <version>_CC .
.It Va <version>_CPP
The pathname of the
.Nm cpp
program of the compiler.
.It Va <version>_CPPFLAGS
Any additional flags to pass to
.Va <version>_CPP .
.It Va <version>_CXX
The pathname of the
.Nm c++
program of the compiler.
.It Va <version>_CXXFLAGS
Any additional flags to pass to
.Va <version>_CXX .
.It Va <version>_VERSION
What to output when the
.Fl dumpversion
option is used.
This helps
.Nm clang
with
.Xr pkgsrc 7 .
.El
.Pp
Once configured the compiler can then be used like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
env CCVER=clang make
.Ed
.Pp
To build world and kernel, use the following instructions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src
fetch http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/~swildner/world_clang.diff
patch -p1 <world_clang.diff
env WORLD_CCVER=clang make -DNO_GCC44 buildworld
env WORLD_CCVER=clang make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYCONF
.Ed
.Pp
Currently, defaults are provided for
.Nm clang
(installed from pkgsrc's
.Pa lang/clang )
and
.Nm clangsvn
(installed from SVN trunk as described in
.Pa http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html ) .
