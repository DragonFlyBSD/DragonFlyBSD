.Sh NAME
.Nm make.conf
.Nd system build information
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains settings that control the compilation of the
.Dx
sources.
The file
.Nm
is generally created by the system administrator when the values need
to be changed from their defaults.
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm
is not to run commands or perform compilation actions
directly.
Instead, it is included by the various makefiles in
.Pa /usr/src
which conditionalize their internal actions according to the settings
found there.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/make.conf
file is included from the appropriate
.Pa Makefile
which specifies the default settings for all the available options.
Options need only be specified in
.Pa /etc/make.conf
when the system administrator wishes to override these defaults.
.Pp
The build procedures occur in three areas: world, kernel, and
documentation.
Variables set in
.Nm
may be applicable during builds in one, two, or all of these areas.
They may be specified for a particular build via the
.Fl D
option of
.Xr make 1 .
.Pp
The following lists provide a name and short description for each
variable you can use during the indicated builds.
The values of variables flagged as
.Vt bool
are ignored; the variable being set at all (even to
.Dq Li FALSE
or
.Dq Li NO )
causes it to be treated as if it were set.
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are used for all builds, or are used by the
.Pa makefiles
for things other than builds.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va CPUTYPE
.Pq Vt str
Controls which processor should be targeted for generated code.
This controls processor-specific optimizations in certain code
(currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value of
.Va CFLAGS
and
.Va COPTFLAGS
to contain the appropriate optimization directive to
.Xr gcc 1 .
The automatic setting of
.Va CFLAGS
and
.Va COPTFLAGS
may be overridden using the
.Va NO_CPU_CFLAGS
and
.Va NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS
variables, respectively.  Refer to
.Pa /usr/share/examples/etc/defaults/make.conf
for a list of recognized
.Va CPUTYPE
options.
.It Va CCVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which GCC version to use by default.
It should be set as
.Li CCVER?=
so as not to interfere with overrides from userland.
We currently recommend that an override NOT be set in
.Pa /etc/make.conf .
Currently accepted values for compilers which are part of
.Dx
are
.Dq gcc47
and
.Dq gcc80
(default).
All other values will handled according to the settings in
.Xr compilers.conf 5 .
.It Va WORLD_CCVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which version of GCC builds the base system, including
the kernel.
.Dq gcc80
is the default value.
.It Va LDVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which linker to use by default.  Currently accepted
values are
.Dq ld.gold
(GNU gold linker, default) and
.Dq ld.bfd
(classic GNU ld linker).
.It Va WORLD_LDVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which linker builds the base system, including
the kernel.
.Dq ld.gold
is the default value.
.It Va BINUTILSVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which binutils to use by default.
Currently accepted values are
.Dq binutils227
and
.Dq binutils234
(default).
.It Va WORLD_BINUTILSVER
.Pq Vt str
Controls which version of binutils builds the base system, including
the kernel.
.Dq binutils234
is the default value.
.It Va WORLD_CFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Controls the compiler setting when compiling C code.
Optimization levels are controlled by
.Va WORLD_CCOPTLEVEL .
.Va BDECFLAGS
is provided as a set of
.Xr gcc 1
settings suggested by
.An Bruce Evans Aq Mt bde@FreeBSD.org
for developing and testing changes.
They can be used safely, if set, by:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
WORLD_CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}
.Ed
.It Va WORLD_CCOPTLEVEL
(str) Allows to override default compiler optimization level
.Fl \&Ox .
Common levels are: 0, 1, 2, 3, g, s, fast.
Use of
.Fl O3
and
.Fl Ofast
is strongly discouraged.
.It Va DEBUG_FLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Similar to
.Va WORLD_CFLAGS
but it will cause
.Va STRIP
to be set to a blank value, if set.
Typically,
.Va DEBUG_FLAGS
is set to
.Fl g
for compiling with debug symbols.
.It Va NO_CPU_CFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Setting this variable will prevent CPU specific compiler flags
from being automatically added to
.Va CFLAGS
during compile time.
.It Va CXXFLAGS
.Pq Vt str
Controls the compiler settings when compiling C++ code.
.Va CXXFLAGS
is initially set to the value of
.Va CFLAGS .
If you want to add to the
.Va CXXFLAGS
value, use
.Dq Li +=
instead of
.Dq Li = .
.It Va CSTD
.Pq Vt str
The default C standard to use when compiling world and kernel C code.
Defaults are
.Li gnu99
for world and
.Li c99
for the kernel.
.It Va INSTALL
.Pq Vt str
the default install command.
To have components compared before doing the install, use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INSTALL="install -C"
.Ed
.It Va NO_BACKUP
.Pq Vt str
Inhibit automatic backup of world binaries as port of
.Dq installworld
.Xr make 1
target.
Default is unset.
.It Va WORLD_BACKUP
.Pq Vt str
defines where system binaries will be backed up for the
.Dq backupworld
.Xr make 1
target.
The default is
.Dq /var/backups/world_backup .
.It Va AUTO_BACKUP
.Pq Vt str
defines where system binaries will be backed up automatically
as part of the
.Dq installworld
.Xr make 1
target.
The default is
.Dq Ev MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX Ns /world_binaries/ Ns Ev DESTDIR .
.It Va LOCAL_DIRS
.Pq Vt str
List of directories that should be entered when running
.Xr make 1
in
.Pa /usr/src .
.It Va MAKE_SHELL
.Pq Vt str

.Ed
.It Va MODULES_OVERRIDE
.Pq Vt str
Set to a list of modules to build instead of all of them.

.Pq Vt str
Set this to
.Dq Fl L
to cause
.Xr mtree 8
to follow symlinks.
.It Va STRIP
.Pq Vt str
Set this to the flag to pass to the
.Xr strip 1
command.
If set to a blank value, debug symbols will not be removed.
.Va STRIP
is automatically set to a blank value if
.Va DEBUG_FLAGS
is set.
.It Va WANT_HESIOD
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to build
.Xr hesiod 3
support into libc.
.It Va NO_NS_CACHING
.Pq Vt bool
Set this to disable name caching in the nsswitch subsystem.
The generic caching daemon,
.Xr nscd 8 ,
will not be built either if this option is set.
.It Va NO_WERROR
Set this if you don't want
.Fl Werror
to be added to
.Va CWARNFLAGS
or used in the kernel build.
.It Va STATIC_LOCALES
.Pq Vt str

Currently supported locales are: BIG5 EUC EUCTW ISO2022 MSKanji UTF8
.El
.Pp
The following list provides a name and short description for variables
that are only used doing a kernel build:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Va BOOT_COMCONSOLE_PORT
.Pq Vt str
The port address to use for the console if the boot blocks have
been configured to use a serial console instead of the keyboard/video card.

.It Va COPTFLAGS
.Pq Vt str

.It Va KCFLAGS
Allows you to add additional compiler flags for kernel and module compiles.
But use

it to enforce a lower optimization level.
.It Va KERNCONF
.Pq Vt str
Controls which kernel configurations will be
built by

and installed by
.Dq Li "${MAKE} installkernel" .

.Ed
.Pp
will build the kernels specified by the config files

and install the kernel specified by the config file
.Pa MINE .
It defaults to
.Pa X86_64_GENERIC .
