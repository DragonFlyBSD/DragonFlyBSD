.Nm HAMMER
.Nd HAMMER file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd options HAMMER
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hammer_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
To mount via
.Xr fstab 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/ad0s1d[:/dev/ad1s1d:...]	/mnt hammer rw 2 0
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file system provides facilities to store file system data onto disk devices
and is intended to replace UFS as the default file system for
.Dx .
Among its features are instant crash recovery,
large file systems spanning multiple volumes,
fine grained history retention,
mirroring capability, and pseudo file systems.
For a more detailed introduction refer to the paper listed in the
.Sx SEE ALSO
section.
For some common usages of
.Nm
see the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section below.
.Pp
All functions related to managing
.Nm
file systems are provided by the
.Xr newfs_hammer 8 ,
.Xr mount_hammer 8 ,
.Xr hammer 8 ,
and
.Xr undo 1
utilities.
.Ss Instant Crash Recovery
After a non-graceful system shutdown,
.Nm
file systems will be brought back into a fully coherent state
when mounting the file system, usually within a few seconds.
.Ss Large File Systems & Multi Volume
A
.Nm
file system can span up to 256 volumes.
Each volume occupies a
.Dx
disk slice or partition, or another special file,
and can be up to 4096 TB in size.
For volumes over 2 TB in size
.Xr gpt 8
and
.Xr disklabel64 8
normally need to be used.
.Ss Transaction IDs
The
.Nm
file system uses 64 bit, hexadecimal transaction IDs to refer to historical
file or directory data.
An ID has the format
.Li 0x%016llx ,
such as
.Li 0x00000001061a8ba6 .
.Pp

.Xr hammer 8
commands:
.Ar synctid
.Ss History & Snapshots
History metadata on the media is written with every sync operation, so that
by default the resolution of a file's history is 30-60 seconds until the next
prune operation.
Prior versions of files or directories are generally accessible by appending
.Li @@
and a transaction ID to the name.
The common way of accessing history, however, is by taking snapshots.
.Pp
Snapshots are softlinks to prior versions of directories and their files.
Their data will be retained across prune operations for as long as the
softlink exists.
Removing the softlink enables the file system to reclaim the space
again upon the next prune & reblock operations.
.Pp

.Xr hammer 8
commands:
.Ar history ,
.Ar snapshot
.Ss Reblocking & Pruning
Reblocking will reorder all elements and thus defragment the file system and
free space for reuse.
Pruning is the act of deleting file system history.
Only history used by the given snapshots and history from after the latest
snapshot will be retained.
All other history is deleted.

.Ar reblock-dirs ,

.Ar prune ,
.Ar prune-everything
.Ss Mirroring & Pseudo File Systems
In order to allow inode numbers to be duplicated on the slaves
.Nm Ap s
mirroring feature uses
.Dq Pseudo File Systems
(PFSs).
A
.Nm
file system supports up to 65536 PFSs.
Multiple slaves per master are supported, but multiple masters per slave
are not.
Slaves are always read-only.
Upgrading slaves to masters and downgrading masters to slaves are supported.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Preparing the File System
To create and mount a
.Nm
file system use the
.Xr newfs_hammer 8
and
.Xr mount_hammer 8
commands.
Note that all
.Nm
file systems must have a unique name on a per-machine basis.
.Bd -literal
newfs_hammer -L Home /dev/ad0s1d
mount_hammer /dev/ad0s1d /home
.Ed
.Pp
Similarly, multi volume file systems can be created and mounted by
specifying additional arguments.
.Bd -literal
newfs_hammer -L MultiHome /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d
mount_hammer /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d /home
.Ed
.Pp
Once created and mounted,
.Nm
file systems need to be reblocked periodically in order not to fill up
over time, either manually or with a
.Xr cron 8
job.
It is recommended that the
.Xr hammer 8
utility's
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
options be used for this job;
for example, to reblock the
.Pa /home
file system every night at 2:15 for up to 5 minutes:
.Bd -literal
15 2 * * * hammer -c /var/run/Home -t 300 reblock /home >/dev/null 2>&1
.Ed
.Ss Snapshots
The
.Xr hammer 8
utility's
.Ar snapshot
command provides several ways of taking snapshots.
They all assume a directory where snapshots are kept.
.Bd -literal
mkdir /snaps
hammer snapshot /home /snaps/snap1
(...after some changes in /home...)
hammer snapshot /home /snaps/snap2
.Ed
.Pp
The softlinks in
.Pa /snaps
point to the state of the
.Pa /home
directory at the time each snapshot was taken, and could now be used to copy
the data somewhere else for backup purposes.
.Ss Pruning
A snapshot directory is also the argument to the
.Xr hammer 8 Ap s
.Ar prune
command which frees historical data from the file system that is not
pointed to by any snapshot link and is not from after the latest snapshot.
.Bd -literal
rm /snaps/snap1
hammer prune /snaps
.Ed
.Pp
Unless the file system is mounted with the
.Ar nohistory
option, it might be advisable to also set up
.Xr cron 8
jobs for pruning no longer used historical data regularly.
.Ss Mirroring
Mirroring can be set up using
.Nm Ap s
pseudo file systems.
To associate the slave with the master its shared UUID should be set to
the master's shared UUID as output by the
.Nm hammer Ar pfs-master
command.
.Bd -literal
hammer pfs-master /home/master
hammer pfs-slave /home/slave shared-uuid=<master's shared uuid>
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Pa /home/slave
link is unusable for as long as no mirroring operation has taken place.
.Pp
To mirror the master's data, either pipe a
.Fa mirror-read
command into a
.Fa mirror-write
or, as a short-cut, use the
.Fa mirror-copy
command (which works across a
.Xr ssh 1
connection as well).
.Bd -literal
hammer mirror-copy /home/master /home/slave
