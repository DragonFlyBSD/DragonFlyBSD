.Dt MAILER.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mailer.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr mailwrapper 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/mail/mailer.conf
contains a series of pairs. The first member of each pair is the name
of a program invoking
.Xr mailwrapper 8
which is typically a symbolic link to
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail .
(On a typical system,
.Xr newaliases 1
and
.Xr mailq 1
would be set up this way.)
The second member of each pair is the name of the program to
actually execute when the first name is invoked. The file may also
contain comments, denoted by a # mark in the first column of any line.
.Sh FILES
/etc/mail/mailer.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of how to set up an
.Nm
for traditional sendmail invocation behavior (installed from DPorts)
.Bd -literal
# Use sendmail as Mail Transfer Agent
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq		/usr/local/bin/mailq
newaliases	/usr/local/bin/newaliases
hoststat	/usr/local/bin/hoststat
purgestat	/usr/local/bin/purgestat
.Ed
.Pp
This example shows how to invoke a sendmail-workalike like Postfix
installed from DPorts to replace
.Xr dma 8
.Bd -literal
# Use postfix as Mail Transfer Agent
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/sendmail
mailq		/usr/local/bin/mailq
newaliases	/usr/local/bin/newaliases
hoststat	/usr/bin/true
purgestat	/usr/bin/true
.Ed
.Pp
This example shows how to invoke a sendmail-workalike like OpenSMTPd
installed from DPorts to replace
.Xr dma 8
.Bd -literal
# Use opensmtpd as Mail Transfer Agent
sendmail	/usr/local/sbin/smtpctl
mailq		/usr/local/sbin/smtpctl
newaliases	/usr/local/sbin/smtpctl
hoststat	/usr/bin/true
purgestat	/usr/bin/true
.Ed
.Pp
These are the default contents of the file
.Bd -literal
# Use dma as Mail Transfer Agent
sendmail	/usr/libexec/dma
mailq		/usr/libexec/dma
newaliases	/usr/libexec/dma
hoststat	/usr/libexec/dma
purgestat	/usr/libexec/dma
