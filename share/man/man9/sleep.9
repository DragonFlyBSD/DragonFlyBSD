.Dt SLEEP 9
.Sh NAME
.Nm tsleep ,
.Nm wakeup ,
.Nm wakeup_one
.Nd wait/sleep/block for events
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/systm.h
.In sys/proc.h
.Ft int
.Fn tsleep "void *ident" "int flag" "const char *wmesg" "int timo"
.Ft void
.Fn wakeup "void *ident"
.Ft void
.Fn wakeup_one "void *ident"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn tsleep
and
.Fn wakeup
handle event-based process blocking.
If a process must wait for an
external event, it is put on sleep by
.Nm tsleep .
The parameter
.Ar ident
is an arbitrary address that uniquely identifies the event on which
the process is being asleep.
All processes sleeping on a single
.Fa ident
are woken up later by
.Nm wakeup ,
often called from inside an interrupt routine, to indicate that the
resource the process/thread was blocking on is available now.
.Pp
The parameter
.Fa wmesg
is a string describing the sleep condition for tools like
.Xr ps 1 .
Due to the limited space of those programs to display arbitrary strings,
this message should not be longer than 6 characters.
.Pp
The
.Fn wakeup_one
function is used to make the first process/thread in the queue that is
sleeping on the parameter
.Fa ident
runnable.
This can prevent the system from becoming saturated
when a large number of processes/threads are sleeping on the same address,
but only one of them can actually do any useful work when made
runnable.
.Pp
The
.Fn tsleep
function is general in its use and suspends the current process/thread until a
wakeup is performed on the specified identifier.
The process/thread will then be made runnable.
The process/thread will sleep at most
.Fa timo
\&/ hz seconds (0 means no timeout).
If
.Fa flags
contains the
.Dv PCATCH
flag, signals are checked before and after sleeping, else signals are
ignored.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Unlike
.Fx ,
the
.Fn tsleep
function in
.Dx
ignores priority information because it is not required by the
.Tn LWKT
subsystem.
Sleeps without the
.Dv P_SINTR
flag set are assumed to be disk-waits, otherwise they are
normal sleeps.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn tsleep
function returns
.Li 0
if awakened, otherwise an appropriate error code is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq EWOULDBLOCK
The timeout will expire.
.It Bq ERESTART
The signal needs to be delivered to the system call should and
it should be restarted if possible.
This only happens if
.Dv PCATCH
was set in
.Fa flags .
.It Bq EINTR
The system needs to be interrupted by the signal.
This only happens if
.Dv PCATCH
was set in
.Fa flags .

.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr malloc 9
.Sh HISTORY
The sleep/wakeup process synchronization mechanism is very old.
It appeared in a very early version of Unix.
.Pp
.Nm Tsleep
appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
