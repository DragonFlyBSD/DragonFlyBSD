.Sh DESCRIPTION
Condition variables are used in conjunction with locks to wait for conditions
to occur.
Condition variables are created with
.Fn cv_init ,
where
.Fa cvp
is a pointer to space for a
.Vt struct cv ,
and
.Fa desc
is a pointer to a null-terminated character string that describes the condition
variable.
Condition variables are destroyed with
.Fn cv_destroy .
Threads wait on condition variables by calling
.Fn cv_wait ,
.Fn cv_wait_sig ,
.Fn cv_timedwait ,
or
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig .
Threads unblock waiters by calling
.Fn cv_signal
to unblock one waiter, or
.Fn cv_broadcast
or
.Fn cv_broadcastpri
to unblock all waiters.
.Fn cv_broadcastpri
is a synonym for
.Fn cv_broadcast
in
.Dx
and discards the
.Fa pri
parameter.
.Pp
A thread must hold
.Fa l
before calling
.Fn cv_wait ,
.Fn cv_wait_sig ,
.Fn cv_timedwait ,
or
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig .
When a thread waits on a condition,
.Fa l
is atomically released before the thread is blocked, then atomically reacquired
before the function call returns.
All waiters must pass the same
.Fa l
in conjunction with
.Fa cvp .
.Pp
When
.Fn cv_wait ,
.Fn cv_wait_sig ,
.Fn cv_timedwait ,
and
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig
unblock, their calling threads are made runnable.
.Fn cv_timedwait
and
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig
wait for at most
.Fa timo
/ hz seconds before being unblocked and returning
.Er EWOULDBLOCK ;
otherwise, they return 0.
.Fn cv_wait_sig
and
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig
return prematurely with a value of
.Er EINTR
or
.Er ERESTART
if a signal is caught, or 0 if signaled via
.Fn cv_signal
or
.Fn cv_broadcast .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Condition variables exist primarily for code imported from other systems; for
.Dx
code, the
.Fn tsleep
/
.Fn wakeup
family of functions should be used instead.
.Pp
Condition variables can currently only release
.Xr lockmgr 9
locks.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn cv_wait_sig ,
.Fn cv_timedwait ,
and
.Fn cv_timedwait_sig
return 0.
Otherwise, a non-zero error code is returned.
.Sh FILES
Condition variables are implemented in
.Pa /sys/kern/kern_condvar.c .
The public interface and structure is found in
.Pa /sys/sys/condvar.h .
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr lockmgr 9 ,

.Sh HISTORY
Condition variables appeared in
