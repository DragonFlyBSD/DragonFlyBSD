.Dt MEMTEMP 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm memtemp
.Nd device driver for memory thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device dimm"
.Cd "device coremctl"
.Cd "device memtemp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
memtemp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the memory thermal sensor.
The values are exposed through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
tree.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% sysctl hw.sensors
hw.sensors.dimm0.temp0: 40.00 degC (node0 chan0 DIMM0 temp), OK
hw.sensors.dimm1.temp0: 39.00 degC (node0 chan1 DIMM0 temp), OK
.Ed
.Pp
The DIMM location and configurable critical temperature thresholds
are exposed through hw.dimminfo
.Xr sysctl 3
tree.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% sysctl hw.dimminfo
hw.dimminfo.dimm0.node: 0
hw.dimminfo.dimm0.chan: 0
hw.dimminfo.dimm0.slot: 0
hw.dimminfo.dimm0.temp_hiwat: 93
hw.dimminfo.dimm0.temp_lowat: 88
hw.dimminfo.dimm1.node: 0
hw.dimminfo.dimm1.chan: 1
hw.dimminfo.dimm1.slot: 0
hw.dimminfo.dimm1.temp_hiwat: 93
hw.dimminfo.dimm1.temp_lowat: 88
.Ed
.Pp
If the temperature goes above the configured critical temperature threshold
(temp_hiwat),
a notify event will be sent using
.Xr devctl 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE

.Nm
driver supports the following memory thermal sensors:
