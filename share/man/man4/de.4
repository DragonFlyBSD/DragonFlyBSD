.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd "DEC DC21x4x Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device de"
.Ed
.\".Pp
.\"Alternatively, to load the driver as a
.\"module at boot time, place the following line in
.\".Xr loader.conf 5 :
.\".Bd -literal -offset indent
.\"if_de_load="YES"
.\".Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Ethernet adapters based on the Digital
Equipment DC21x4x based self-contained Ethernet and Fast Ethernet
chips.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation on the 10baseT port
.It 10base2/BNC
Set 10Mbps operation on the BNC port
.It 10base5/AUI
Set 10Mbps operation on the AUI port
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation
.It 100baseFX
Set 100Mbps operation
.It 100baseT4
Set 100Mbps operation (4-pair cat-3 cable)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation
.El
.Pp
Note that the media types available depend on the particular card in use.
Some cards are explicitly programmed to a particular media type by a
setup utility and are not changeable.
.Pp
Use the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command and in particular the
.Fl m
flag to list the supported media types for your particular card.
.Pp
The old
.Dq ifconfig linkN
method of configuration is not supported.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "de%d: waking device from sleep/snooze mode"
The 21041 and 21140A chips support suspending the operation of the card.
.It "de%d: error: desired IRQ of %d does not match device's actual IRQ of %d"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "de%d: not configured; limit of %d reached or exceeded"
There is a limit of 32
.Nm
devices allowed in a single machine.
.It "de%d: not configured; 21040 pass 2.0 required (%d.%d found)"
.It "de%d: not configured; 21140 pass 1.1 required (%d.%d found)"
Certain revisions of the chipset are not supported by this driver.
