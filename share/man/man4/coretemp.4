.Sh NAME
.Nm coretemp
.Nd device driver for Intel Core on-die digital thermal sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device coretemp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
coretemp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensors,
both core level and package level,
for Intel Core and newer CPUs.
The values are exposed through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
tree.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% sysctl hw.sensors
hw.sensors.cpu0.temp0: 50.00 degC (node0 core0 temp), OK
hw.sensors.cpu1.temp0: 50.00 degC (node0 core0 temp), OK
hw.sensors.cpu2.temp0: 47.00 degC (node0 core1 temp), OK
hw.sensors.cpu3.temp0: 47.00 degC (node0 core1 temp), OK
hw.sensors.cpu_node0.temp0: 50.00 degC (node0 temp), OK
.Ed
.Pp
If the core or package temperature reaches critical level,
a notify event will be sent using
.Xr devctl 4 .
