.Nd Advansys PCI 8bit SCSI Host adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device pci
.Cd device adv
.Pp
For one or more SCSI busses:
.Cd device scbus0 at adv0
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the 8bit
.Tn SCSI
bus connected to the Advanced Systems Products, Inc.
.Tn ASC900 ,
.Tn ASC1000 ,
.Tn ASC1090 ,
.Tn ASC1200 ,
.Tn ASC3030 ,
.Tn ASC3050 ,
and
.Tn ASC3150
host adapter chips.
The following tables list the AdvanSys products using these chips,
their bus attachment type, maximum sync rate, and the maximum number of
commands that can be handled by the adapter concurrently.

Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn AdvanceWare
menu, which is accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate, disconnection, tagged queueing,
and the host adapter's SCSI ID.
The global setting for the maximum number of tagged transactions allowed
per target is not honored as the CAM SCSI system will automatically determine
the maximum number of tags a device can receive as well as guarantee fair
resource allocation among devices.
