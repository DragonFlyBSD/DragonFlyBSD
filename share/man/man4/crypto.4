.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto ,
.Nm cryptodev
.Nd hardware crypto access driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device crypto
.Cd device cryptodev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a device-independent framework to support
cryptographic operations in the kernel.
The
.Nm cryptodev
driver provides userland applications access to this support
through the
.Pa /dev/crypto
device.
This node primarily operates in an
.Xr ioctl 2
based model, permitting a variety of applications to query device capabilities,
submit transactions, and get results.
.Pp
If
.Ar count
given in the specification, and is greater than 0, a maximum of one
.Nm
device is created.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply only to the
.Nm
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv CIOCGSESSION"
.It Dv CIOCGSESSION
Setup a new crypto session for a new type of operation.
.It Dv CIOCFSESSION
Free a previously established session.
.It Dv CIOCCRYPT
Perform a crypto operation against a previously setup session.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
Depending on hardware being present, the following symmetric and
asymmetric cryptographic features are potentially available from
.Pa /dev/crypto :
