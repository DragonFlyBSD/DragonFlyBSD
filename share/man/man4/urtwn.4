.Sh NAME
.Nm urtwn
.Nd Realtek RTL8188CU/RTL8188RU/RTL8188EU/RTL8192CU USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device urtwn"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_urtwn_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In both cases, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to acknowledge the firmware license (see below):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
legal.realtek.license_ack=1
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Realtek
RTL8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU, RTL8188EUS, RTL8188RU and RTL8192CU chipsets.
.Pp
The RTL8188CUS and RTL8188EUS are highly integrated 802.11n adapters that
combine a MAC, a 1T1R capable baseband and an RF in a single chip.
They operate in the 2GHz spectrum only.
The RTL8188RU is a high-power variant of the RTL8188CUS.
The RTL8188CE-VAU is a PCI Express Mini Card adapter that attaches
to the USB interface.
.Pp
The RTL8192CU is a highly integrated multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO)
802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 2T2R capable baseband and an
RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
This driver requires the firmware built with the
.Xr urtwnfw 4
module to work.
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/realtek/LICENSE
must be agreed to by adding the following line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "legal.realtek.license_ack=1"

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev urtwn0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev urtwn0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev urtwn0 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "urtwn%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "urtwn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
