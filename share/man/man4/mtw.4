.Nd MediaTek MT7601U USB IEEE 802.11n wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device mtw"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_amrr"
.Ed
.Pp
Firmware is also needed, and provided by:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device mtwfw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time,
place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_mtw_load="YES"
mtw7601ufw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides support for
MediaTek MT7601U USB wireless network adapters.
If the appropriate hardware is detected,
the driver will be automatically loaded with
.Xr devd 8 .
If driver autoloading is explicitly disabled, enable the module in
.Xr rc.conf 5 or
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or at boot with
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
