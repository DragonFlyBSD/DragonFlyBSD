# DragonFly maintains two sets of compilers.
# In order to keep man page generation simple when the primary compiler
# changes, this makefile will direct the makefile that included it how
# to name the man pages and if it should hardlink a generic man page to it.
# The same approach is used for the two sets of binutils
