# DragonFly maintains two sets of binutils.  The last time it was
# necessary to swap the primary and backup status between them, 37 files
# had to be changed.  This makefile include aims to make that process much
# simpler by having common variables located in one place to control the
# state.
#
# Additionally, with each new import or upgrade of binutils, dozens of
# Makefiles have to be individually customized over the previous version.
# Ideally in the future the Makefiles are generic and only have to be
# copied over in most cases.
