O create process -> assign master proc struct + fqps for each disk present
O  create disk -> walk all master proc struct and add new fqp for new disk
O	-> also keep some list on what disks are associated to the scheduler
  destroy disk -> walk all master proc struct and remove new fqp; cancel all bios
	-> remove from global list of disks with this scheduler
  zombie process -> cancel all reads in all fqps; push all writes in all fqps to disk
O new buf -> assign master proc struct using curthread/curproc
O queue -> find actual fqp in master proc struct of buf


  master proc ref count:
O	+ create process
O	+ new buf
	- zombie process
	- queue

  fqp ref count:
O	+ queue
O	- completed

  master proc list (kept globally):
O	+ create process
	- zombie process

  fqp list (kept per proc):
O	+ create disk (walk master list, create fqps)
O	+ create process (one fqp per disk on create process)
	- destroy disk (walk master list, destroy fqps)
	- zombie process (destroy all fqps in master proc struct)


so how do we do buckets?
option 1)
	- each process has a member pointing to a bucket
	- bucket has also a list of all processes that are members
	- per-disk list of buckets
	- each bucket is allocated a proportional amount of total throughput
	- each fqp in each bucket gets a fair share of the bucket's proportional amount
	=> so when do we instantiate them?
		-> each fq disk has a list of all buckets that exist
		-> but buckets are marked either active or inactive
			-> inactive buckets are skipped and not accounted for
			   in bandwidth allocation.


if fqp has references and is in flight but disk is destroyed?
	-> set to inactive
	-> on completion see if it's cancelled (?)
