/*
 * Lock request types:
 *
 *   LK_SHARED
 *	Get one of many possible shared locks. If a process holding an
 *	exclusive lock requests a shared lock, the exclusive lock(s) will
 *	be downgraded to shared locks.
 *
 *   LK_EXCLUSIVE
 *	Stop further shared locks, when they are cleared, grant a pending
 *	upgrade if it exists, then grant an exclusive lock. Only one exclusive
 *	lock may exist at a time, except that a process holding an exclusive
 *	lock may get additional exclusive locks if it explicitly sets the
 *	LK_CANRECURSE flag in the lock request, or if the LK_CANRECUSE flag
 *	was set when the lock was initialized.
 *
 *   LK_UPGRADE
 *	The process must hold a shared lock that it wants to have upgraded
 *	to an exclusive lock. Other processes may get exclusive access to
 *	the resource between the time that the upgrade is requested and the
 *	time that it is granted.
 *
 *   LK_EXCLUPGRADE
 *	the process must hold a shared lock that it wants to have upgraded
 *	to an exclusive lock. If the request succeeds, no other processes
 *	will have gotten exclusive access to the resource between the time
 *	that the upgrade is requested and the time that it is granted.
 *	However, if another process has already requested an upgrade, the
 *	request will fail (see error returns below).
 *
 *   LK_DOWNGRADE
 *	The process must hold an exclusive lock that it wants to have
 *	downgraded to a shared lock. If the process holds multiple (recursive)
 *	exclusive locks, they will all be downgraded to shared locks.
 *
 *   LK_RELEASE
 *	Release one instance of a lock.
 *
 *   LK_CANCEL_BEG
 *	The current exclusive lock holder can cancel any blocked lock requests,
 *	or any new requests, whos callers specified LK_CANCELABLE.  They will
 *	receive a ENOLCK error code.  Cancel beg/end does not stack.
 *
 *	The cancel command stays in effect until the exclusive lock holder
 *	releases the last count on the lock or issues a LK_CANCEL_END command.
 *
 *   LK_CANCEL_END
 *	The current exclusive lock holder can stop canceling new requests
 *	whos callers specify LK_CANCELABLE.  The exclusive lock is maintained.
 *
 *	Note that the last release of the exclusive lock will also
 *	automatically end cancel mode.
 *
 *
 * ---
 *
 *   LK_EXCLOTHER - return for lockstatus().  Used when another process
 *	holds the lock exclusively.
 *
 * These are flags that are passed to the lockmgr routine.
