/*
 * The buffer header describes an I/O operation in the kernel.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *	b_bufsize represents the filesystem block size (for this particular
 *	block) and/or the allocation size or original request size.  This
 *	field is NOT USED by lower device layers.  VNode and device
 *	strategy routines WILL NEVER ACCESS THIS FIELD.
 *
 *	b_bcount represents the I/O request size.  Unless B_NOBCLIP is set,
 *	the device chain is allowed to clip b_bcount to accomodate the device
 *	EOF.  Note that this is different from the byte oriented file EOF.
 *	If B_NOBCLIP is set, the device chain is required to generate an
 *	error if it would othrewise have to clip the request.  Buffers 
 *	obtained via getblk() automatically set B_NOBCLIP.  It is important
 *	to note that EOF clipping via b_bcount is different from EOF clipping
 *	via returning a b_actual < b_bcount.  B_NOBCLIP only effects block
 *	oriented EOF clipping (b_bcount modifications).
 *
 *	b_actual represents the number of bytes of I/O that actually occured,
 *	whether an error occured or not.  b_actual must be initialized to 0
 *	prior to initiating I/O as the device drivers will assume it to
 *	start at 0.
 *
 *	b_dirtyoff, b_dirtyend.  Buffers support piecemeal, unaligned
 *	ranges of dirty data that need to be written to backing store.
 *	The range is typically clipped at b_bcount (not b_bufsize).
 *
 *	b_bio1 and b_bio2 represent the two primary I/O layers.  Additional
 *	I/O layers are allocated out of the object cache and may also exist.
 *
 *	b_bio1 is the logical layer and contains offset or block number 
 *	data for the primary vnode, b_vp.  I/O operations are almost
 *	universally initiated from the logical layer, so you will often
 *	see things like:  vn_strategy(bp->b_vp, &bp->b_bio1).
 *
 *	b_bio2 is the first physical layer (typically the slice-relative
 *	layer) and contains the translated offset or block number for
 *	the block device underlying a filesystem.   Filesystems such as UFS
 *	will maintain cached translations and you may see them initiate
 *	a 'physical' I/O using vn_strategy(devvp, &bp->b_bio2).  BUT, 
 *	remember that the layering is relative to bp->b_vp, so the
 *	device-relative block numbers for buffer cache operations that occur
 *	directly on a block device will be in the first BIO layer.
 *
 *	b_ops - initialized if a buffer has a bio_ops
 *
 *	NOTE!!! Only the BIO subsystem accesses b_bio1 and b_bio2 directly.
 *	ALL STRATEGY LAYERS FOR BOTH VNODES AND DEVICES ONLY ACCESS THE BIO
 *	PASSED TO THEM, AND WILL PUSH ANOTHER BIO LAYER IF FORWARDING THE
 *	I/O DEEPER.  In particular, a vn_strategy() or dev_dstrategy()
 *	call should not ever access buf->b_vp as this vnode may be totally
 *	unrelated to the vnode/device whos strategy routine was called.

/*
 * These flags are kept in b_flags.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *	B_PAGING	Indicates that bp is being used by the paging system or
 *			some paging system and that the bp is not linked into
 *			the b_vp's clean/dirty linked lists or ref counts.
 *			Buffer vp reassignments are illegal in this case.
 *
 *	B_CACHE		This may only be set if the buffer is entirely valid.
 *			The situation where B_DELWRI is set and B_CACHE is
 *			clear MUST be committed to disk by getblk() so 
 *			B_DELWRI can also be cleared.  See the comments for
 *			getblk() in kern/vfs_bio.c.  If B_CACHE is clear,
 *			the caller is expected to clear B_ERROR|B_INVAL,
 *			set BUF_CMD_READ, and initiate an I/O.
 *
 *			The 'entire buffer' is defined to be the range from
 *			0 through b_bcount.
 *
 *	B_CLUSTEROK	This flag is typically set for B_DELWRI buffers
 *			by filesystems that allow clustering when the buffer
 *			is fully dirty and indicates that it may be clustered
 *			with other adjacent dirty buffers.  Note the clustering
 *			may not be used with the stage 1 data write under NFS
 *			but may be used for the commit rpc portion.
 *
 *	B_VMIO		Indicates that the buffer is tied into an VM object.
 *			The buffer's data is always PAGE_SIZE aligned even
 *			if b_bufsize and b_bcount are not.  ( b_bufsize is 
 *			always at least DEV_BSIZE aligned, though ).
 *	
 *	B_DIRECT	Hint that we should attempt to completely free
 *			the pages underlying the buffer.   B_DIRECT is 
 *			sticky until the buffer is released and typically
 *			only has an effect when B_RELBUF is also set.
 *
 *	B_LOCKED	The buffer will be released to the locked queue
 *			regardless of its current state.  Note that
 *			if B_DELWRI is set, no I/O occurs until the caller
 *			acquires the buffer, clears B_LOCKED, then releases
 *			it again.
 *
 *	B_AGE		When allocating a new buffer any buffer encountered
 *			with B_AGE set will be reallocated more quickly then
 *			buffers encountered without it set.  B_AGE is set
 *			as part of the loop so idle buffers should eventually
 *			wind up with B_AGE set.  B_AGE explicitly does NOT
 *			cause the buffer to be instantly reallocated for
 *			other purposes.
 *
 *			Standard buffer flushing routines leave B_AGE intact
 *			through the DIRTY queue and into the CLEAN queue.
 *			Setting B_AGE on a dirty buffer will not cause it
 *			to be flushed more quickly but will cause it to be
 *			reallocated more quickly after having been flushed.
 *
 *	B_NOCACHE	Request that the buffer and backing store be
 *			destroyed on completion.  If B_DELWRI is set and the
 *			write fails, the buffer remains intact.
 *
 *	B_NOTMETA	May be set on block device buffers representing
 *			file data (i.e. which aren't really meta-data),
 *			which will cause the buffer cache to set PG_NOTMETA
 *			in the VM pages when releasing them and the
 *			swapcache to not try to cache them.
 *
 *	B_MARKER	Special marker buf, always skip.
 *
 *	B_KVABIO	Owner of buffer (but not necessarily the underlying
 *			vnode or device) supports the KVABIO API.  The owner
 *			of the buffer will only operate on the buffer's
 *			b_data via the API.  Locked buffers only.  This
 *			flag is cleared on brelse/bqrelse
 *
 * WARNING! bp->b_data is not necessarily synchronized to the current cpu
 *	    when B_KVABIO operations is specified.  Callers using bp->b_data
 *	    who specify B_KVABIO operation must call bkvasync() if they use
 *	    bp->b_data directly, or whenever they pass a buffer between cpus
 *	    (between threads, e.g. from helper threads) if the target thread
 *	    intends to access bp->b_data.
