 * Note that the spinlock structure is retained whether we are SMP or not,

 * builds.
 *
 * DragonFly spinlocks use a chasing counter.  A core desiring a spinlock
 * does a atomic_fetchadd_int() on countb and then waits for counta to
 * reach its value using MWAIT.  Releasing the spinlock involves an
 * atomic_add_int() on counta.  If no MWAIT is available the core can spin
 * waiting for the value to change which is still represented by a shared+ro
 * cache entry.
