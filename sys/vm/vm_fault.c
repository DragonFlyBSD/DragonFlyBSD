 *
 * vm.fast_fault	Enables pre-faulting zero-fill pages
 *
 * vm.prefault_pages	Number of pages (1/2 negative, 1/2 positive) to
 *			prefault.  Scan stops in either direction when
 *			a page is found to already exist.
 *
 * This code used to be per-platform pmap_prefault().  It is now
 * machine-independent and enhanced to also pre-fault zero-fill pages
 * (see vm.fast_fault) as well as make them writable, which greatly
 * reduces the number of page faults programs incur.
 *
 * Application performance when pre-faulting zero-fill pages is heavily
 * dependent on the application.  Very tiny applications like /bin/echo
 * lose a little performance while applications of any appreciable size
 * gain performance.  Prefaulting multiple pages also reduces SMP
 * congestion and can improve SMP performance significantly.
 *
 * NOTE!  prot may allow writing but this only applies to the top level
 *	  object.  If we wind up mapping a page extracted from a backing
 *	  object we have to make sure it is read-only.
