10 second timeout in CAM


-----

DELAY's might tsleep, so interrupts might run.  fix poll loop to detect
completion via other interrupts.

Locking serialize_enter/exit.  Lots of recursion.   Needs help.  Use
lockmgr()?   Needs to be converted to per-port locking, also.

Port multiplier support (basics are now in)

Simulate various mode pages (serial number access and so forth).

NOTE RACE:  When stopping a port explicitly which has not self stopped,
i.e. CR is still on, we can race command completion and not have a good
idea what bits to reload into CI etc to restart the commands that
were running.  This should only be done if we intend to reset the port.

NOTE RACE:  A transient IFS interrupt (fatal phy/protocol error) can occur
when soft-resetting through a port multiplier, between the first and second
FISes.  We need to be able to lock access to the port.
