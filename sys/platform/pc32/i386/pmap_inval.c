 * pmap invalidation support code.  Certain hardware requirements must
 * be dealt with when manipulating page table entries and page directory
 * entries within a pmap.  In particular, we cannot safely manipulate
 * page tables which are in active use by another cpu (even if it is
 * running in userland) for two reasons: First, TLB writebacks will
 * race against our own modifications and tests.  Second, even if we
 * were to use bus-locked instruction we can still screw up the 
 * target cpu's instruction pipeline due to Intel cpu errata.
