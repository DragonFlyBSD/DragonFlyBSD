/*
 * This subsystem implements most of the core support functions for
 * the hammer2_chain structure.
 *
 * Chains are the in-memory version on media objects (volume header, inodes,
 * indirect blocks, data blocks, etc).  Chains represent a portion of the
 * HAMMER2 topology.
 *
 * Chains are no-longer delete-duplicated.  Instead, the original in-memory
 * chain will be moved along with its block reference (e.g. for things like
 * renames, hardlink operations, modifications, etc), and will be indexed
 * on a secondary list for flush handling instead of propagating a flag
 * upward to the root.
 *
 * Concurrent front-end operations can still run against backend flushes
 * as long as they do not cross the current flush boundary.  An operation
 * running above the current flush (in areas not yet flushed) can become
 * part of the current flush while ano peration running below the current
 * flush can become part of the next flush.

 * Create an indirect block that covers one or more of the elements in the

 * and leaving the original parent lock/ref intact as well.
 *
 * If an error occurs, NULL is returned and *errorp is set to the H2 error.
 *
 * The returned chain depends on where the specified key falls.
 *
 * The key/keybits for the indirect mode only needs to follow three rules:
 *
 * (1) That all elements underneath it fit within its key space and
 *
 * (2) That all elements outside it are outside its key space.
 *
 * (3) When creating the new indirect block any elements in the current
 *     parent that fit within the new indirect block's keyspace must be
 *     moved into the new indirect block.
 *
 * (4) The keyspace chosen for the inserted indirect block CAN cover a wider
 *     keyspace the the current parent, but lookup/iteration rules will
 *     ensure (and must ensure) that rule (2) for all parents leading up
 *     to the nearest inode or the root volume header is adhered to.  This
 *     is accomplished by always recursing through matching keyspaces in
 *     the hammer2_chain_lookup() and hammer2_chain_next() API.
 *
 * The current implementation calculates the current worst-case keyspace by
 * iterating the current parent and then divides it into two halves, choosing
 * whichever half has the most elements (not necessarily the half containing
 * the requested key).
 *
 * We can also opt to use the half with the least number of elements.  This
 * causes lower-numbered keys (aka logical file offsets) to recurse through
 * fewer indirect blocks and higher-numbered keys to recurse through more.
 * This also has the risk of not moving enough elements to the new indirect
 * block and being forced to create several indirect blocks before the element
 * can be inserted.
 *
 * Must be called with an exclusively locked parent.
