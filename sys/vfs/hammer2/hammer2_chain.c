/*
 * This subsystem implements most of the core support functions for
 * the hammer2_chain structure.
 *
 * Chains are the in-memory version on media objects (volume header, inodes,
 * indirect blocks, data blocks, etc).  Chains represent a portion of the
 * HAMMER2 topology.
 *
 * Chains are no-longer delete-duplicated.  Instead, the original in-memory
 * chain will be moved along with its block reference (e.g. for things like
 * renames, hardlink operations, modifications, etc), and will be indexed
 * on a secondary list for flush handling instead of propagating a flag
 * upward to the root.
 *
 * Concurrent front-end operations can still run against backend flushes
 * as long as they do not cross the current flush boundary.  An operation
 * running above the current flush (in areas not yet flushed) can become
 * part of the current flush while ano peration running below the current
 * flush can become part of the next flush.

 *

 * deletion.   The new (*parentp) will be locked and referenced and the old
 * will be unlocked and dereferenced (no change if they are both the same).
 *
 * The matching chain will be returned exclusively locked.  If NOLOCK is
 * requested the chain will be returned only referenced.  Note that the
 * parent chain must always be locked shared or exclusive, matching the
 * HAMMER2_LOOKUP_SHARED flag.  We can conceivably lock it SHARED temporarily
 * when NOLOCK is specified but that complicates matters if *parentp must
 * inherit the chain.
 *
 * NOLOCK also implies NODATA, since an unlocked chain usually has a NULL
 * data pointer or can otherwise be in flux.
 *
 * NULL is returned if no match was found, but (*parentp) will still
 * potentially be adjusted.
 *
 * If a fatal error occurs (typically an I/O error), a dummy chain is
 * returned with chain->error and error-identifying information set.  This
 * chain will assert if you try to do anything fancy with it.
 *
 * XXX Depending on where the error occurs we should allow continued iteration.
 *
 * On return (*key_nextp) will point to an iterative value for key_beg.
 * (If NULL is returned (*key_nextp) is set to (key_end + 1)).
 *
 * This function will also recurse up the chain if the key is not within the
 * current parent's range.  (*parentp) can never be set to NULL.  An iteration
 * can simply allow (*parentp) to float inside the loop.
 *
 * NOTE!  chain->data is not always resolved.  By default it will not be
 *	  resolved for BREF_TYPE_DATA, FREEMAP_NODE, or FREEMAP_LEAF.  Use
