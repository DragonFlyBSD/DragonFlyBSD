* make sure we aren't using a shared lock during RB_SCAN's?

* overwrite in write_file case w/compression - if device block size changes
  the block has to be deleted and reallocated.  See hammer2_assign_physical()
  in vnops.

* freemap / clustering.  Set block size on 2MB boundary so the cluster code
  can be used for reading.

* need API layer for shared buffers (unfortunately).

* add magic number to inode header, add parent inode number too, to
  help with brute-force recovery.

* modifications past our flush point do not adjust vchain.
  need to make vchain dynamic so we can (see flush_scan2).??

* MINIOSIZE/RADIX set to 1KB for now to avoid buffer cache deadlocks
  on multiple locked inodes.  Fix so we can use LBUFSIZE!  Or,
  alternatively, allow a smaller I/O size based on the sector size
  (not optimal though).

* When making a snapshot, do not allow the snapshot to be mounted until
  the in-memory chain has been freed in order to break the shared core.

* Snapshotting a sub-directory does not snapshot any
  parent-directory-spanning hardlinks.

* Snapshot / flush-synchronization point.  remodified data that crosses
  the synchronization boundary is not currently reallocated.  see
  hammer2_chain_modify(), explicit check (requires logical buffer cache
  buffer handling).

* on fresh mount with multiple hardlinks present separate lookups will
  result in separate vnodes pointing to separate inodes pointing to a
  common chain (the hardlink target).

  When the hardlink target consolidates upward only one vp/ip will be
  adjusted.  We need code to fixup the other chains (probably put in
  inode_lock_*()) which will be pointing to an older deleted hardlink
  target.

* Filesystem must ensure that modify_tid is not too large relative to
  the iterator in the volume header, on load, or flush sequencing will
  not work properly.  We should be able to just override it, but we
  should complain if it happens.

* Kernel-side needs to clean up transaction queues and make appropriate
  callbacks.

* Userland side needs to do the same for any initiated transactions.

* Nesting problems in the flusher.

* Inefficient vfsync due to thousands of file buffers, one per-vnode.
  (need to aggregate using a device buffer?)

* Use bp->b_dep to interlock the buffer with the chain structure so the
  strategy code can calculate the crc and assert that the chain is marked
  modified (not yet flushed).

* Deleted inode not reachable via tree for volume flush but still reachable
  via fsync/inactive/reclaim.  Its tree can be destroyed at that point.

* The direct write code needs to invalidate any underlying physical buffers.
  Direct write needs to be implemented.

* Make sure a resized block (hammer2_chain_resize()) calculates a new
  hash code in the parent bref

* The freemap allocator needs to getblk/clrbuf/bdwrite any partial
  block allocations (less than 64KB) that allocate out of a new 64K
  block, to avoid causing a read-before-write I/O.

* Check flush race upward recursion setting SUBMODIFIED vs downward
  recursion checking SUBMODIFIED then locking (must clear before the
  recursion and might need additional synchronization)

* There is definitely a flush race in the hardlink implementation between
  the forwarding entries and the actual (hidden) hardlink inode.

  This will require us to associate a small hard-link-adjust structure
  with the chain whenever we create or delete hardlinks, on top of
  adjusting the hardlink inode itself.  Any actual flush to the media
  has to synchronize the correct nlinks value based on whether related
  created or deleted hardlinks were also flushed.

* When a directory entry is created and also if an indirect block is
  created and entries moved into it, the directory seek position can
  potentially become incorrect during a scan.

* When a directory entry is deleted a directory seek position depending
  on that key can cause readdir to skip entries.

* TWO PHASE COMMIT - store two data offsets in the chain, and
  hammer2_chain_delete() needs to leave the chain intact if MODIFIED2 is
  set on its buffer until the flusher gets to it?


				OPTIMIZATIONS

* If a file is unlinked buts its descriptors is left open and used, we
  should allow data blocks on-media to be reused since there is no
  topology left to point at them.
