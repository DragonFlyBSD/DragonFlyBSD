/*
 * HAMMER B-Tree index
 *
 * HAMMER implements a modified B+Tree.   B+Trees store records only
 * at their leaves and HAMMER's modification is to adjust the internal
 * elements so there is a boundary element on each side instead of sub-tree
 * pointers.
 *
 * We just call our modified B+Tree a 'B-Tree' in HAMMER documentation to
 * reduce confusion.
 *
 * A B-Tree internal node looks like this:
 *
 *	B N N N N N N B   <-- boundary and internal elements
 *       S S S S S S S    <-- subtree pointers
 *
 * A B-Tree leaf node looks like this:
 *
 *	L L L L L L L L   <-- leaf elemenets
 *			      (there is also a previous and next-leaf pointer)
 *
 * The recursion radix of an internal node is reduced by 1 relative to
 * a normal B-Tree in order to accomodate the right-hand boundary.
 *
 * The big benefit to using a B-Tree with built-in bounds information is
 * that it makes it possible to cache pointers into the middle of the tree
 * and not have to start searches, insertions, OR deletions at the root node.
 * The boundary elements allow searches to progress in a definitive direction
 * from any point in the tree without revisting nodes.  It is also possible
 * to terminate searches early and make minor adjustments to the boundaries
 * (within the confines of the parent's boundaries) on the fly.  This greatly
 * improves the efficiency of many operations.
 *
 * HAMMER B-Trees are per-cluster.  The global multi-cluster B-Tree is
 * constructed by allowing internal nodes to link to the roots of other
 * clusters.  Fields in the cluster header then reference back to its
 * parent and use the cluster generation number to detect stale linkages.
 *
 * The B-Tree balancing code can operate within a cluster or across the
 * filesystem's ENTIRE B-Tree super-structure.  A cluster's B-Tree root
 * can be a leaf node in the worse case.  A cluster is guarenteed to have
 * sufficient free space to hold a single completely full leaf in the
 * degenerate case.
 *
 * All of the structures below are on-disk structures.
 */

/*
 * Common base for all B-Tree element types (40 bytes)
 *
 * obj_type is set to the object type the record represents if an inode,
 * directory entry, or an inter-cluster reference.  A cluster range is
 * special in that the B-Tree nodes represent a range within the B-Tree
 * inclusive of rec_type field, so obj_type must be used to detect the
 * cluster range entries.
 *
 * btype is only used by the elements making up an internal or leaf B-Tree
 * node and applies to the node rather then to the key.  This means that
 * btype must be assigned/reassigned after any update to the base_elm making
 * up a B-Tree element.

 *
 * 'count' always refers to the number of elements and is non-inclusive of
 * the right-hand boundary for an internal node.

 * The use of a fairly large radix is designed to reduce the number of

 * (The B-Tree node type for the nodes referenced by its elements).
