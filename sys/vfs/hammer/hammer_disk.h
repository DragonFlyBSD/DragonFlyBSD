 * The structures below represent the on-disk format for a HAMMER
 * filesystem.  Note that all fields for on-disk structures are naturally
 * aligned.  The host endian format is used - compatibility is possible
 * if the implementation detects reversed endian and adjusts data accordingly.
 *
 * Most of HAMMER revolves around the concept of an object identifier.  An
 * obj_id is a 64 bit quantity which uniquely identifies a filesystem object
 * FOR THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THE FILESYSTEM.  This uniqueness allows backups
 * and mirrors to retain varying amounts of filesystem history by removing
 * any possibility of conflict through identifier reuse.
 *
 * A HAMMER filesystem may span multiple volumes.
 *
 * A HAMMER filesystem uses a 16K filesystem buffer size.  All filesystem
 * I/O is done in multiples of 16K.  Most buffer-sized headers such as those
 * used by volumes, super-clusters, clusters, and basic filesystem buffers
 * use fixed-sized A-lists which are heavily dependant on HAMMER_BUFSIZE.
 *
 * 64K X-bufs are used for blocks >= a file's 1MB mark.
 *
 * Per-volume storage limit: 52 bits		4096 TB
 * Per-Zone storage limit: 60 bits		1 MTB
 * Per-filesystem storage limit: 60 bits	1 MTB

 * All on-disk HAMMER structures which make up elements of the UNDO FIFO
 * contain a hammer_fifo_head and hammer_fifo_tail structure.  This structure
 * contains all the information required to validate the fifo element
 * and to scan the fifo in either direction.  The head is typically embedded
 * in higher level hammer on-disk structures while the tail is typically
 * out-of-band.  hdr_size is the size of the whole mess, including the tail.
 *
 * All undo structures are guaranteed to not cross a 16K filesystem
 * buffer boundary.  Most undo structures are fairly small.  Data spaces
 * are not immediately reused by HAMMER so file data is not usually recorded
 * as part of an UNDO.
 *
 * PAD elements are allowed to take up only 8 bytes of space as a special
 * case, containing only hdr_signature, hdr_type, and hdr_size fields,
 * and with the tail overloaded onto the head structure for 8 bytes total.
 *
 * Every undo record has a sequence number.  This number is unrelated to
 * transaction ids and instead collects the undo transactions associated
 * with a single atomic operation.  A larger transactional operation, such
 * as a remove(), may consist of several smaller atomic operations
 * representing raw meta-data operations.
 *
 *				HAMMER VERSION 4 CHANGES
 *
 * In HAMMER version 4 the undo structure alignment is reduced from 16384
 * to 512 bytes in order to ensure that each 512 byte sector begins with
 * a header.  The reserved01 field in the header is now a 32 bit sequence
 * number.  This allows the recovery code to detect missing sectors
 * without relying on the 32-bit crc and to definitively identify the current
 * undo sequence space without having to rely on information from the volume
 * header.  In addition, new REDO entries in the undo space are used to
 * record write, write/extend, and transaction id updates.
 *
 * The grand result is:
 *
 * (1) The volume header no longer needs to be synchronized for most
 *     flush and fsync operations.
 *
 * (2) Most fsync operations need only lay down REDO records
 *
 * (3) Data overwrite for nohistory operations covered by REDO records
 *     can be supported (instead of rolling a new block allocation),
 *     by rolling UNDO for the prior contents of the data.
 *
 *				HAMMER VERSION 5 CHANGES
 *
 * Hammer version 5 contains a minor adjustment making layer2's bytes_free
 * field signed, allowing dedup to push it into the negative domain.

 * The volume header takes up an entire 16K filesystem buffer and may
 * represent up to 64KTB (65536 TB) of space.
 *
 * Special field notes:
 *
 *	vol_bot_beg - offset of boot area (mem_beg - bot_beg bytes)
 *	vol_mem_beg - offset of memory log (clu_beg - mem_beg bytes)
 *	vol_buf_beg - offset of the first buffer.
 *
 *	The memory log area allows a kernel to cache new records and data
 *	in memory without allocating space in the actual filesystem to hold
 *	the records and data.  In the event that a filesystem becomes full,
 *	any records remaining in memory can be flushed to the memory log
 *	area.  This allows the kernel to immediately return success.
