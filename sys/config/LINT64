# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# Beginning with FreeBSD 2.0.5 you can wire down your SCSI devices so
# that a given bus, target, and LUN always come on line as the same
# device unit.  In earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned
# in the order that the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This
# means that if you removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite
# your /etc/fstab file, and also that you had to be careful when adding
# a new disk as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device
# configuration around.

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

# device	scbus0 at ahc0		# Single bus device
# device	scbus1 at ahc1 bus 0	# Single bus device
# device	scbus3 at ahc2 bus 0	# Twin bus device
# device	scbus2 at ahc2 bus 1	# Twin bus device
# device 	da0 at scbus0 target 0 unit 0
# device	da1 at scbus3 target 1
# device	da2 at scbus2 target 3
# device	sa1 at scbus1 target 6
# device	cd

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The "unknown" device (uk? in pre-2.0.5) is now part of the base SCSI
# configuration and doesn't have to be explicitly configured.

# HARDWARE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# Mandatory ISA devices: isa
#
device		isa

#
# Options for `isa':
#
# AUTO_EOI_1 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the master 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# This option breaks suspend/resume on some portables.
#
# AUTO_EOI_2 enables the `automatic EOI' feature for the slave 8259A
# interrupt controller.  This saves about 0.7-1.25 usec for each interrupt.
# Automatic EOI is documented not to work for the slave with the
# original i8259A, but it works for some clones and some integrated
# versions.
#
# MAXMEM specifies the amount of RAM on the machine; if this is not
# specified, DragonFly will first read the amount of memory from the CMOS
# RAM, so the amount of memory will initially be limited to 64MB or 16MB
# depending on the BIOS.  If the BIOS reports 64MB, a memory probe will
# then attempt to detect the installed amount of RAM.  If this probe
# fails to detect >64MB RAM you will have to use the MAXMEM option.
# The amount is in kilobytes, so for a machine with 128MB of RAM, it would
# be 131072 (128 * 1024).

# BROKEN_KEYBOARD_RESET disables the use of the keyboard controller to

#
# The 'rl' device provides support for PCI fast ethernet adapters based

#
# The 'ti' device provides support for PCI gigabit ethernet NICs based
# on the Alteon Networks Tigon 1 and Tigon 2 chipsets. This includes the
# Alteon AceNIC, the 3Com 3c985, the Netgear GA620 and various others.

# series 'ThunderLAN' cards and integrated ethernet controllers. This
# includes several Compaq Netelligent 10/100 cards and the built-in

# early support
#
# The `wb' device provides support for various fast ethernet adapters

# the Winbond W89C940F, which is an NE2000 clone.
#
# The `xl' device provides support for the 3Com 3c900, 3c905 and
# 3c905B (Fast) Etherlink XL cards and integrated controllers. This
# includes the integrated 3c905B-TX chips in certain Dell Optiplex and
# Dell Precision desktop machines and the integrated 3c905-TX chips
# in Dell Latitude laptop docking stations.
#
# The 'bktr' device is a PCI video capture device using the Brooktree
# bt848/bt848a/bt849a/bt878/bt879 chipset. When used with a TV Tuner it forms a
# TV card, eg Miro PC/TV, Hauppauge WinCast/TV WinTV, VideoLogic Captivator,

# Using sysctl(8) run-time overrides on a per-card basis can be made
#
# options 	BKTR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
# or
# options 	BKTR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC

# to prevent hangs during initialisation.  eg VideoLogic Captivator PCI.
#
# options 	BKTR_USE_PLL
# PAL or SECAM users who have a 28Mhz crystal (and no 35Mhz crystal)
# must enable PLL mode with this option. eg some new Bt878 cards.
#
# options 	BKTR_GPIO_ACCESS
# This enable IOCTLs which give user level access to the GPIO port.
#
# options 	BKTR_NO_MSP_RESET
# Prevents the MSP34xx reset. Good if you initialise the MSP in another OS first
#
# options 	BKTR_430_FX_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into Intel 430FX chipset compatibility mode.
#
# options 	BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into SIS/VIA chipset compatibility mode which is
# needed for some old SiS and VIA chipset motherboards.
# This also allows Bt878/879 chips to work on old OPTi (<1997) chipset
# motherboards and motherboards with bad or incomplete PCI 2.1 support.
# As a rough guess, old = before 1998
#
# options 	BKTR_NEW_MSP34XX_DRIVER

# The 'dpt' driver provides support for DPT controllers (http://www.dpt.com/).

# The DPT controllers are commonly re-licensed under other brand-names -
