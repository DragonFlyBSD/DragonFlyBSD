What is libaura?
----------------

libaura is a LIBrary of Assorted Useful Reusable Abstractions.  Notably,
it provides dictionary and extensible buffer data types, memory management
functions (wrappers to malloc() and free()), and filesystem predicates
(is_file(), is_dir(), etc.)

What is the current state of the project?
-----------------------------------------

EXPERIMENTAL.  libaura's application programming interface may change at
any time.  libaura 3.0 is not intended to be backwards-compatible with
any previous versions.  If you use libaura in a project, be prepared to
chase API changes.

How do I build and install libaura?
-----------------------------------

On a BSD-based system, go into the libaura source directory and type:

	make

Once built, it can be installed by typing (as root):

	make install

Directions may differ for other systems.

An alternative method is to build libaura using the ports system and
install it using the package system.

How do I use libaura from a program?
------------------------------------

You can give gcc the following sort of command line flags to tell it to
link your program with libaura:

	gcc foo.c -o foo -L/usr/local/lib -laura

See the libaura source code for the list of available functions and what
they do.
