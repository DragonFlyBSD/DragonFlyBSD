.Sh NAME
.Nm powerd
.Nd simple ACPI based CPU/power control
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dtQ
.Op Fl p Ar hysteresis
.Op Fl u Ar trigger_up
.Op Fl r Ar poll_time
.Op Fl T Ar sample_time
.Op Fl B Ar minimum_battery_life
.Op Fl L Ar battery_life_linger
.Op Fl P Ar battery_poll_interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon monitors the CPU load and automatically adjusts the CPU
frequency up or down.
.Pp
All CPUs will be set to their maximum frequency when the 1 second
machine load exceeds 25% of one CPU.
All CPUs will be set to their
minimum frequency when the 10 second machine load drops below 12% of
one CPU.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl p Ar hysteresis"
.It Fl d
Debug option.
Causes
.Nm
to not go to the background and prints some debug output to
.Va stdout .
.It Fl p Ar hysteresis
Percent of the upper limit to subtract as an hysteresis value to scale
down to the min frequency.
The default is 10 (meaning 10%).
.It Fl t
Turbo mode.
Disables switching to turbo mode as maximum frequency completely.
Switching to turbo mode as maximum frequency is enabled by default,
if the CPU supports it.
.It Fl u Ar trigger_up
Per CPU load limit in percent to force maximum frequency.
The default is 25 (meaning an instantanious load of 0.25 on a
single cpu).  The load is calculated over 3 polls.
It is suggested that this value not be made lower than
around 7.
.It Fl r Ar poll_time
Polling time in seconds.  Default is 1.0.
Setting this value lower will poll for load changes faster.
For example, a workstation might want to use 0.2 or 0.4.
.Nm can become unstable if you make this value too small.
.It Fl T Ar sample_time
Total sample interval in seconds.  Default is 8.0.
This effects how quickly powerd ratchets down the frequency
and cpus on an idle machine.  Longer times will ratchet down
more slowly.
For example, a workstation might want to use a value of 30.0.
.It Fl B Ar minimum_battery_life
If battery life is less than or equal to the specified value,
the machine will start shutting down process.
Default is 2 (2% battery life left).
.It Fl L Ar battery_life_linger
If battery life is less than or equal to the configured value,
shutting down the machine will be delayed by the specified value.
During the delay,
alert message will be logged to the console,
and audio alert will be alarmed.
If AC line is plugged in during this delay,
shutting down process will be cancelled.
Default is 60 seconds.
.It Fl P Ar battery_poll_interval
Poll the battery life at the specified interval.
If 0 is specified,
battery life monitoring will be disabled.
Default is 5 seconds.
.It Fl Q
Don't alarm audio alert,
if the battery life is low.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The defaults work well for servers but a workstation user might want
to use something like the following in their
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to ratchet up the machine more quickly in response to spike loads
(such as when you are browsing).

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with a non-zero code if the required sysctls are not
present.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Dx 2.7 .
.Sh BUGS
I'm shocked I tell you, shocked that there might be bugs in this program!
