.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon monitors the CPU load and automatically adjusts the CPU
performance up or down accordingly.
.Pp
The
.Nm
also monitors battery life.
If the battery life is low
(less than or equal to 2% by default),
.Nm
will send audio alert immediately,
and shutdown the machine after lingering for a little while
(60 seconds by default).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl p Ar hysteresis"
.It Fl b Ar backlight_percentage
Set backlight to the specified percentage,
if AC line is not plugged in.
.It Fl c
Enable mwait C-state hint adjustment,
if it is available.
.It Fl d
Debug option.
Causes
.Nm
to not go to the background and prints some debug output to
.Va stdout .
.It Fl e
Enable Intel Performance and Energy Bias Hint adjustment,
if it is available.
.It Fl f
Disable CPU power domain frequency adjustment.
CPU power domain frequency adjustment does not reduce CPU power consumption
much
(if any)
on some of the modern Intel CPUs,
when the CPU is idle.
.It Fl h Ar highest_freq
If CPU power domain frequency adjustment is enabled,
then frequency of CPU power domains will not be set to a value higher
than the specified limit (unit: MHz).
.It Fl l Ar lowest_freq
If CPU power domain frequency adjustment is enabled,
then frequency of CPU power domains will not be set to a value lower
than the specified limit (unit: MHz).
.Pp
NOTE: This option is ignored if powerd is in temperature management.
Temperature management will lower the frequency in excess of this value
if necessary (but usually doesn't have to).
.It Fl p Ar hysteresis
Percent of the upper limit to subtract as an hysteresis value to scale
down to the min performance.
The default is 10
(meaning 10%).
.It Fl r Ar poll_time
Polling time in seconds.
Default is 1.0.
Setting this value lower will poll for load changes faster.
For example,
a workstation might want to use 0.2 or 0.4.
.Nm can become unstable if you make this value too small.
.It Fl t
Turbo mode.
Disables switching to turbo mode as maximum frequency completely.
Switching to turbo mode as maximum frequency is enabled by default,
if the CPU supports it.
.It Fl u Ar trigger_up
Per CPU load limit in percent to force maximum performance.
The default is 25
(meaning an instantanious load of 0.25 on a single cpu).
The load is calculated over 3 polls.
It is suggested that this value not be made lower than around 7.
.It Fl B Ar minimum_battery_life
If battery life is less than or equal to the specified value,
the machine will start shutting down process.
Default is 2
(2% battery life left).
.It Fl H Ar lowtemp:hightemp
If the cpu temperature goes above lowtemp, powerd will begin ramping down
the cpu frequency, reaching the lowest possible cpu frequency when the cpu
temperature reaches hightemp.
The default range is 75:85 (in degrees C), which tends to hold a laptop
to ~80C under heavy load.
Generally
speaking, no machine cpu should be allowed to go above 80C even if the
cpu can handle it, it means something is seriously wrong with your cooling
system and you are stressing the cpu and mobo if you allow it.
.Pp
The default range starts at 75C.  Most desktops with reasonable cooling
will not exceed this value so it makes for a good default.  Laptops can
easily exceed 75C, sometimes reaching into the high 80's or even the 90's
due to poor cooling and vendors tweaking their BIOS/fan-controls to the
high side to do well in benchmarks.
If you want your laptop to last, however, you really don't want it to get
that hot.  For powerd to be able to stabilize, we recommend that a minimum
of a 10C range be used.  So, for example, 70:80, or 75:85, and so forth.
The user can change this range when starting powerd by adjusting
.Va powerd_flags
in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
This option can cause cpu fans to oscillate, and you may need to adjust the
range if the oscillation is annoying to you.  The basic reason for this is
that small changes to the cpu frequency can have a huge effect on system
power consumption, causing the BIOS-controlled fan to react, which in turn
also changes the temperature and causes powerd to react.
.It Fl L Ar battery_life_linger
If battery life is less than or equal to the configured value,
shutting down the machine will be delayed by the specified value.
During the delay,
alert message will be logged to the console,
and audio alert will be alarmed.
If AC line is plugged in during this delay,
shutting down process will be cancelled.
Default is 60 seconds.
.It Fl P Ar battery_poll_interval
Poll the battery life at the specified interval.
If 0 is specified,
battery life monitoring will be disabled.
Default is 5 seconds.
.It Fl Q
Don't alarm audio alert,
if the battery life is low.
.It Fl T Ar sample_time
Total sample interval in seconds.
Default is 8.0.
This effects how quickly powerd ratchets down the performance
and cpus on an idle machine.
Longer times will ratchet down more slowly.
For example,
a workstation might want to use a value of 30.0.
.It Fl U
Don't adjust userland scheduler's usable CPUs.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with a non-zero code if required sysctls are not
present.
If the system is unable to report temperature,
.Nm
will still run, but will not be able to do any temperature-based frequency
management.
.Pp
If a new instance of
.Nm
is run from the command line, it will automatically kill any previous
instance running in the background.
The system operator does not have to manually kill or signal
.Nm
when restarting it, simply invoke a new copy.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The defaults work well for servers but a workstation user might want
to use something like the following in their
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to ratchet up the machine more quickly in response to spike loads
(such as when you are browsing).
