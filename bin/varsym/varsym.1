.Sh NAME
.Nm varsym
.Nd get and set user and system-wide variables for variant symlinks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl qdsup
.Ar var[=data]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program manages user and system-wide variables.  These variables are typically
used by the system to resolve variant symlinks but may also be used generally.
.Pp
For each operand set, modify, retrieve, or delete the specified variable.
By default variables specified without data are retrieved and variables
specified with data are set.  Variables may be set to empty.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.  When retrieving a variable only its data is printed.
.It Fl d
Delete mode.  The specified variables are deleted.  Any specified data is
ignored.
.It Fl s
This option causes variables to be set system-wide and restricts retrievals
to system-specific variables.
.It Fl u
This option causes variables to be set on a per-user-id basis and restricts
retrievals to user-specific variables.  This is the default.
.It Fl p
This option causes variables to be set on a per-process basis and restricts
retrievals to process-specific variables.  It exists for completeness.  Note
that since
.Nm
is run as its own process, using this option will not effect your shell's
namespace.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
No errors occured.
.It 1
A requested variable could not be found
.It 2
A requested variable could not be set
