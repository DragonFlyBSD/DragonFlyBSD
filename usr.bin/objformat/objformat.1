.Sh NAME
.Nm objformat
.Nd reports default binary format and program deflector
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Nm prog
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If run as
.Nm
the default object file format is reported.
The only supported object file format is
.Ar elf .
.Pp
If invoked by any other name, the path of the
.Nm prog
that will be executed is determined as follows:
.Pp
If
.Nm prog
is a binutil (such as
.Xr as 1
and
.Xr ld 1 ) ,
it is expanded to
.Pa /usr/libexec/<binutils>/elf/ Ns Nm prog
and executed.
.Dq <binutils>
defaults to the current binutils version used by
.Dx
and can be overridden using the
.Ev BINUTILSVER
environment variable.
.Pp
If
.Nm prog
is a compiler (such as
.Xr gcc 1 ) ,
it is expanded to
.Pa /usr/libexec/<ccver>/ Ns Nm prog
and executed.
.Dq <ccver>
defaults to the current compiler used by
.Dx
and can be overridden using the
.Ev CCVER
environment variable.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width OBJFORMAT_PATH
.It Ev BINUTILSVER
The
.Dq <binutils>
component to be used for binutils paths.
.It Ev CCVER
The
.Dq <ccver>
component to be used for compiler paths.
.It Ev LDVER
If this variable is defined as
.Dq ld.gold
then the ld command will be an alias for the gold linker.  If it is
undefined or any other value, the ld command will execute the classic
gnu linker.
.It Ev OBJFORMAT_PATH
If
.Ev OBJFORMAT_PATH
is set, its value is prepended to the path name determined by the
.Nm
rules.
If it is a sequence of colon separated paths, each of
.Ev OBJFORMAT_PATH Ap s
elements is prepended to the path name until execution succeeds.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility returns with exit code 1
if called with an improper number of arguments, or if
.Nm prog
could not be executed.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr getobjformat 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
