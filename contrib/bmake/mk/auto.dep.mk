# This module provides automagic dependency generation along the
# lines suggested in the GNU make.info

# set MKDEP_MK=auto.dep.mk and dep.mk will include us

# This version differs from autodep.mk, in that 
# we use ${.TARGET:T}.d rather than ${.TARGET:T:R}.d
# this makes it simpler to get the args to -MF and -MT right
# and ensure we can simply include all the .d files.
# 
# However suffix rules do not work with something like .o.d so we
# don't even try to handle 'make depend' gracefully.
# dep.mk will handle that itself.
