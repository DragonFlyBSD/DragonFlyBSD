Two manual pages (pam_passwdqc.8 and passwdqc.conf.5) are under the
3-clause BSD-style license as specified within the files themselves.

concat.c, wordset_4k.c, wordset_4k.h, pam_macros.h, and pwqcheck.php
are in the public domain, but at your option they may also be used under
this package's license below.

Files in ci directory (install-dependencies.sh and run-build-and-tests.sh)
are provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or
later.  These files are not included in passwdqc release tarballs.

The rest of the files in this package fall under the following terms
(heavily cut-down "BSD license"):
