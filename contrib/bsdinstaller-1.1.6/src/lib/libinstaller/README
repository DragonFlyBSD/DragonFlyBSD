What is libinstaller?
---------------------

libinstaller is a library of support functions for the BSD Installer
application, dfuibe_installer.

What is the current state of the project?
-----------------------------------------

EXPERIMENTAL.  libinstaller's application programming interface may change at
any time.  If you use libinstaller in a project, be prepared to chase API
changes.  Both the API and the ABI of libinstaller 5.0 are not backwards-
compatible with those of of previous versions.

How do I build and install libinstaller?
----------------------------------------

On a BSD-based system, go into the libinstaller source directory and type:

	make

Once built, it can be installed by typing (as root):

	make install

Directions may differ for other systems.

An alternative method is to build libinstaller using the ports system and
install it using the package system.

How do I use libinstaller from a program?
-----------------------------------------

libinstaller requires libdfui, which in turn requires libaura, but none
of these are statically linked with it, so any consumers of libinstaller
will also need to link to libaura and libdfui.

You can give gcc the following sort of command line flags to tell it to
link your program with libinstaller:

	gcc foo.c -o foo -L/usr/local/lib -laura -ldfui -linstaller

See the libinstaller source code for the list of available functions and
what they do.
