This is tnftp version 20210827.

Changes in tnftp 20200705 to 20210827:

	Validate address in server's PASV and LPSV responses. Previously a
	hostile server could cause ftp to open a data connection elsewhere.

	Avoid intermittent crashes by fixing signal handler restoration.

	Fix intermittent failures in -q QUITTIME by not using restartable
	signals.

	Set SO_KEEPALIVE on control connection to attempt to avoid timeouts.

	Update to NetBSD-ftp 20210826.

	Improve configure tests.

	Improve manual page.

	Display usage to stdout with -?.

Changes in tnftp 20151004 to 20200705:

	Avoid crashes by exiting if lostpeer due to a signal
	(e.g., remote server disconnection).

	Issue PWD commands to the server only when we actually
	need the results, not speculatively, just in case we might.
	Works around broken servers, and is quicker too.

	Use "anonymous" instead of the local username for anonymous
	ftp. Avoids unnecesary information leak.

	Use the first name we requested the http/https URL for,
	not any name we ended up with after random redirects.

	Support using CONNECT for https:// via proxy.

	Improve SSL error reporting, and IPv6 endpoint reporting.

	Use the system glob() if required extensions are supported.

	Use the system libedit library by default, instead of
	the local (embedded) libedit.

	Update to NetBSD-ftp 20200608.

	Update local (embedded) libedit to NetBSD as at 2020-07-04.
	Fixes various crashes.

	Portability improvements.

	Implement '-x xferbufsize' to set xferbuf size.

	Add Server Name Indication (SNI) support for https.

	Increase buffer limit used for response handling.

	When using the response to SYST to decide whether to default
	to 'binary' be a lot less specific.
