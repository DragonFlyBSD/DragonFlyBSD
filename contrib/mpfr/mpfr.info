1 Introduction to MPFR
**********************

MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision
arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library.
It aims to extend the class of floating-point numbers provided by the
GNU MP library by a precise semantics. The main differences with the
`mpf' class from GNU MP are:

   * the MPFR code is portable, i.e. the result of any operation does
     not depend (or should not) on the machine word size
     `mp_bits_per_limb' (32 or 64 on most machines);

   * the precision in bits can be set exactly to any valid value for
     each variable (including very small precision);

   * MPFR provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985
     standard.

   In particular, with a precision of 53 bits, MPFR should be able to
exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine
floating-point numbers (e.g., `double' type in C, with a C
implementation that rigorously follows Annex F of the ISO C99 standard
and `FP_CONTRACT' pragma set to `OFF') on the four arithmetic
operations and the square root, except the default exponent range is
much wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented (but can be
emulated).

   This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, Version 2.1 or any later version.  It is permitted to link
MPFR to most non-free programs, as long as when distributing them the
MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a modified MPFR library is
provided.

1.1 How to Use This Manual
==========================

Everyone should read *note MPFR Basics::.  If you need to install the
library yourself, you need to read *note Installing MPFR::, too.

   The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it
is probably a good idea to glance through it.

2 Installing MPFR
*****************

2.1 How to Install
==================

Here are the steps needed to install the library on Unix systems (more
details are provided in the `INSTALL' file):

  1. To build MPFR, you first have to install GNU MP (version 4.1 or
     higher) on your computer.  You need a C compiler, preferably GCC,
     but any reasonable compiler should work.  And you need a standard
     Unix `make' program, plus some other standard Unix utility
     programs.

     Then, in the MPFR build directory, type the following commands.

  2. `./configure'

     This will prepare the build and setup the options according to
     your system.  You can give options to specify the install
     directories (instead of the default `/usr/local'), threading
     support, and so on. See the `INSTALL' file and/or the output of
     `./configure --help' for more information, in particular if you
     get error messages.

  3. `make'

     This will compile MPFR, and create a library archive file
     `libmpfr.a'.  On most platforms, a dynamic library will be
     produced too (see configure).

  4. `make check'

     This will make sure MPFR was built correctly.  If you get error
     messages, please report this to `mpfr@loria.fr'.  (*Note Reporting
     Bugs::, for information on what to include in useful bug reports.)

  5. `make install'

     This will copy the files `mpfr.h' and `mpf2mpfr.h' to the directory
     `/usr/local/include', the library files (`libmpfr.a' and possibly
     others) to the directory `/usr/local/lib', the file `mpfr.info' to
     the directory `/usr/local/share/info', and some other documentation
     files to the directory `/usr/local/share/doc/mpfr' (or if you
     passed the `--prefix' option to `configure', using the prefix
     directory given as argument to `--prefix' instead of `/usr/local').

2.2 Other `make' Targets
========================

There are some other useful make targets:

   * `mpfr.info' or `info'

     Create or update an info version of the manual, in `mpfr.info'.

     This file is already provided in the MPFR archives.

   * `mpfr.pdf' or `pdf'

     Create a PDF version of the manual, in `mpfr.pdf'.

   * `mpfr.dvi' or `dvi'

     Create a DVI version of the manual, in `mpfr.dvi'.

   * `mpfr.ps' or `ps'

     Create a Postscript version of the manual, in `mpfr.ps'.

   * `mpfr.html' or `html'

     Create a HTML version of the manual, in several pages in the
     directory `mpfr.html'; if you want only one output HTML file, then
     type `makeinfo --html --no-split mpfr.texi' instead.

   * `clean'

     Delete all object files and archive files, but not the
     configuration files.

   * `distclean'

     Delete all generated files not included in the distribution.

   * `uninstall'

     Delete all files copied by `make install'.

2.3 Build Problems
==================

In case of problem, please read the `INSTALL' file carefully before
reporting a bug, in particular section "In case of problem".  Some
problems are due to bad configuration on the user side (not specific to
MPFR). Problems are also mentioned in the FAQ
`http://www.mpfr.org/faq.html'.

   Please report problems to `mpfr@loria.fr'.  *Note Reporting Bugs::.
Some bug fixes are available on the MPFR 2.4.2 web page
`http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.4.2/'.

2.4 Getting the Latest Version of MPFR
======================================

The latest version of MPFR is available from
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpfr/' or `http://www.mpfr.org/'.

3 Reporting Bugs
****************

If you think you have found a bug in the MPFR library, first have a look
on the MPFR 2.4.2 web page `http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.4.2/' and the
FAQ `http://www.mpfr.org/faq.html': perhaps this bug is already known,
in which case you may find there a workaround for it. Otherwise, please
investigate and report it.  We have made this library available to you,
and it is not to ask too much from you, to ask you to report the bugs
that you find.

   There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug
report together.

   You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
reproduce the bug.  Include instructions on how to run the test case.

   You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if
the results printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.

   Please include compiler version information in your bug report. This
can be extracted using `cc -V' on some machines, or, if you're using
gcc, `gcc -v'. Also, include the output from `uname -a' and the MPFR
version (the GMP version may be useful too).

   If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we will
not do anything about it (aside of chiding you to send better bug
reports).

   Send your bug report to: `mpfr@loria.fr'.

   If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please send a note
to the same address.

4 MPFR Basics
*************

4.1 Headers and Libraries
=========================

All declarations needed to use MPFR are collected in the include file
`mpfr.h'.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers.  You
should include that file in any program using the MPFR library:

     #include <mpfr.h>

   Note however that prototypes for MPFR functions with `FILE *'
parameters are provided only if `<stdio.h>' is included too (before
`mpfr.h').

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <mpfr.h>

   Likewise `<stdarg.h>' (or `<varargs.h>') is required for prototypes
with `va_list' parameters, such as `mpfr_vprintf'.

   And for any functions using `intmax_t', you must include
`<stdint.h>' or `<inttypes.h>' before `mpfr.h', to allow `mpfr.h' to
define prototypes for these functions. Moreover, users of C++ compilers
under some platforms may need to define the `__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS'
macro (before `<stdint.h>' or `<inttypes.h>' has been included) or
`MPFR_USE_INTMAX_T' (before `mpfr.h' has been included), at least for
portability; of course, it is possible to do that on the command line,
e.g., with `-DMPFR_USE_INTMAX_T'.

   You can avoid the use of MPFR macros encapsulating functions by
defining the `MPFR_USE_NO_MACRO' macro before `mpfr.h' is included.  In
general this should not be necessary, but this can be useful when
debugging user code: with some macros, the compiler may emit spurious
warnings with some warning options, and macros can prevent some
prototype checking.

   All programs using MPFR must link against both `libmpfr' and
`libgmp' libraries.  On a typical Unix-like system this can be done
with `-lmpfr -lgmp' (in that order), for example

     gcc myprogram.c -lmpfr -lgmp

   MPFR is built using Libtool and an application can use that to link
if desired, *note GNU Libtool: (libtool.info)Top.

   If MPFR has been installed to a non-standard location, then it may be
necessary to set up environment variables such as `C_INCLUDE_PATH' and
`LIBRARY_PATH', or use `-I' and `-L' compiler options, in order to
point to the right directories. For a shared library, it may also be
necessary to set up some sort of run-time library path (e.g.,
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH') on some systems. Please read the `INSTALL' file for
additional information.

4.2 Nomenclature and Types
==========================

A "floating-point number" or "float" for short, is an arbitrary
precision significand (also called mantissa) with a limited precision
exponent. The C data type for such objects is `mpfr_t' (internally
defined as a one-element array of a structure, and `mpfr_ptr' is the C
data type representing a pointer to this structure). A floating-point
number can have three special values: Not-a-Number (NaN) or plus or
minus Infinity. NaN represents an uninitialized object, the result of
an invalid operation (like 0 divided by 0), or a value that cannot be
determined (like +Infinity minus +Infinity). Moreover, like in the IEEE
754 standard, zero is signed, i.e. there are both +0 and -0; the
behavior is the same as in the IEEE 754 standard and it is generalized
to the other functions supported by MPFR. Unless documented otherwise,
the sign bit of a NaN is unspecified.

The "precision" is the number of bits used to represent the significand
of a floating-point number; the corresponding C data type is
`mp_prec_t'.  The precision can be any integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN'
and `MPFR_PREC_MAX'. In the current implementation, `MPFR_PREC_MIN' is
equal to 2.

   Warning! MPFR needs to increase the precision internally, in order to
provide accurate results (and in particular, correct rounding). Do not
attempt to set the precision to any value near `MPFR_PREC_MAX',
otherwise MPFR will abort due to an assertion failure. Moreover, you
may reach some memory limit on your platform, in which case the program
may abort, crash or have undefined behavior (depending on your C
implementation).

The "rounding mode" specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result can not be
represented exactly in the destination significand; the corresponding C
data type is `mp_rnd_t'.

A "limb" means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a
single word.  (We chose this word because a limb of the human body is
analogous to a digit, only larger, and containing several digits.)
Normally a limb contains 32 or 64 bits.  The C data type for a limb is
`mp_limb_t'.

4.3 Function Classes
====================

There is only one class of functions in the MPFR library:

  1. Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
     `mpfr_'.  The associated type is `mpfr_t'.

4.4 MPFR Variable Conventions
=============================

As a general rule, all MPFR functions expect output arguments before
input arguments.  This notation is based on an analogy with the
assignment operator.

   MPFR allows you to use the same variable for both input and output
in the same expression.  For example, the main function for
floating-point multiplication, `mpfr_mul', can be used like this:
`mpfr_mul (x, x, x, rnd_mode)'.  This computes the square of X with
rounding mode `rnd_mode' and puts the result back in X.

   Before you can assign to an MPFR variable, you need to initialize it
by calling one of the special initialization functions.  When you're
done with a variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the
functions for that purpose.

   A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared out
between each initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it
may be assigned to any number of times.

   For efficiency reasons, avoid to initialize and clear out a variable
in loops.  Instead, initialize it before entering the loop, and clear
it out after the loop has exited.

   You do not need to be concerned about allocating additional space
for MPFR variables, since any variable has a significand of fixed size.
Hence unless you change its precision, or clear and reinitialize it, a
floating-point variable will have the same allocated space during all
its life.

4.5 Rounding Modes
==================

The following four rounding modes are supported:

   * `GMP_RNDN': round to nearest (roundTiesToEven in IEEE 754-2008)

   * `GMP_RNDZ': round toward zero (roundTowardZero in IEEE 754-2008)

   * `GMP_RNDU': round toward plus infinity (roundTowardPositive in
     IEEE 754-2008)

   * `GMP_RNDD': round toward minus infinity (roundTowardNegative in
     IEEE 754-2008)

   The `round to nearest' mode works as in the IEEE 754 standard: in
case the number to be rounded lies exactly in the middle of two
representable numbers, it is rounded to the one with the least
significant bit set to zero.  For example, the number 5/2, which is
represented by (10.1) in binary, is rounded to (10.0)=2 with a
precision of two bits, and not to (11.0)=3.  This rule avoids the
"drift" phenomenon mentioned by Knuth in volume 2 of The Art of
Computer Programming (Section 4.2.2).

   Most MPFR functions take as first argument the destination variable,
as second and following arguments the input variables, as last argument
a rounding mode, and have a return value of type `int', called the
"ternary value". The value stored in the destination variable is
correctly rounded, i.e. MPFR behaves as if it computed the result with
an infinite precision, then rounded it to the precision of this
variable.  The input variables are regarded as exact (in particular,
their precision does not affect the result).

   As a consequence, in case of a non-zero real rounded result, the
error on the result is less or equal to 1/2 ulp (unit in the last
place) of the target in the rounding to nearest mode, and less than 1
ulp of the target in the directed rounding modes (a ulp is the weight
of the least significant represented bit of the target after rounding).

   Unless documented otherwise, functions returning an `int' return a
ternary value.  If the ternary value is zero, it means that the value
stored in the destination variable is the exact result of the
corresponding mathematical function. If the ternary value is positive
(resp. negative), it means the value stored in the destination variable
is greater (resp. lower) than the exact result. For example with the
`GMP_RNDU' rounding mode, the ternary value is usually positive, except
when the result is exact, in which case it is zero. In the case of an
infinite result, it is considered as inexact when it was obtained by
overflow, and exact otherwise. A NaN result (Not-a-Number) always
corresponds to an exact return value.  The opposite of a returned
ternary value is guaranteed to be representable in an `int'.

   Unless documented otherwise, functions returning a `1' (or any other
value specified in this manual) for special cases (like `acos(0)')
should return an overflow or an underflow if `1' is not representable
in the current exponent range.

4.6 Floating-Point Values on Special Numbers
============================================

This section specifies the floating-point values (of type `mpfr_t')
returned by MPFR functions. For functions returning several values (like
`mpfr_sin_cos'), the rules apply to each result separately.

   Functions can have one or several input arguments. An input point is
a mapping from these input arguments to the set of the MPFR numbers.
When none of its components are NaN, an input point can also be seen as
a tuple in the extended real numbers (the set of the real numbers with
both infinities).

   When the input point is in the domain of the mathematical function,
the result is rounded as described in Section "Rounding Modes" (but see
below for the specification of the sign of an exact zero). Otherwise
the general rules from this section apply unless stated otherwise in
the description of the MPFR function (*note MPFR Interface::).

   When the input point is not in the domain of the mathematical
function but is in its closure in the extended real numbers and the
function can be extended by continuity, the result is the obtained
limit.  Examples: `mpfr_hypot' on (+Inf,0) gives +Inf. But `mpfr_pow'
cannot be defined on (1,+Inf) using this rule, as one can find
sequences (X_N,Y_N) such that X_N goes to 1, Y_N goes to +Inf and X_N
to the Y_N goes to any positive value when N goes to the infinity.

   When the input point is in the closure of the domain of the
mathematical function and an input argument is +0 (resp. -0), one
considers the limit when the corresponding argument approaches 0 from
above (resp. below). If the limit is not defined (e.g., `mpfr_log' on
-0), the behavior must be specified in the description of the MPFR
function.

   When the result is equal to 0, its sign is determined by considering
the limit as if the input point were not in the domain: If one
approaches 0 from above (resp. below), the result is +0 (resp. -0). In
the other cases, the sign must be specified in the description of the
MPFR function. Example: `mpfr_sin' on +0 gives +0.

   When the input point is not in the closure of the domain of the
function, the result is NaN. Example: `mpfr_sqrt' on -17 gives NaN.

   When an input argument is NaN, the result is NaN, possibly except
when a partial function is constant on the finite floating-point
numbers; such a case is always explicitly specified in *note MPFR
Interface::.  Example: `mpfr_hypot' on (NaN,0) gives NaN, but
`mpfr_hypot' on (NaN,+Inf) gives +Inf (as specified in *note Special
Functions::), since for any finite input X, `mpfr_hypot' on (X,+Inf)
gives +Inf.

4.7 Exceptions
==============

MPFR supports 5 exception types:

   * Underflow: An underflow occurs when the exact result of a function
     is a non-zero real number and the result obtained after the
     rounding, assuming an unbounded exponent range (for the rounding),
     has an exponent smaller than the minimum exponent of the current
     range. In the round-to-nearest mode, the halfway case is rounded
     toward zero.

     Note: This is not the single definition of the underflow. MPFR
     chooses to consider the underflow after rounding. The underflow
     before rounding can also be defined. For instance, consider a
     function that has the exact result 7 multiplied by two to the power
     E-4, where E is the smallest exponent (for a significand between
     1/2 and 1) in the current range, with a 2-bit target precision and
     rounding toward plus infinity.  The exact result has the exponent
     E-1. With the underflow before rounding, such a function call
     would yield an underflow, as E-1 is outside the current exponent
     range. However, MPFR first considers the rounded result assuming
     an unbounded exponent range.  The exact result cannot be
     represented exactly in precision 2, and here, it is rounded to 0.5
     times 2 to E, which is representable in the current exponent
     range. As a consequence, this will not yield an underflow in MPFR.

   * Overflow: An overflow occurs when the exact result of a function
     is a non-zero real number and the result obtained after the
     rounding, assuming an unbounded exponent range (for the rounding),
     has an exponent larger than the maximum exponent of the current
     range. In the round-to-nearest mode, the result is infinite.

   * NaN: A NaN exception occurs when the result of a function is a NaN.

   * Inexact: An inexact exception occurs when the result of a function
     cannot be represented exactly and must be rounded.

   * Range error: A range exception occurs when a function that does
     not return a MPFR number (such as comparisons and conversions to
     an integer) has an invalid result (e.g. an argument is NaN in
     `mpfr_cmp' or in a conversion to an integer).


   MPFR has a global flag for each exception, which can be cleared, set
or tested by functions described in *note Exception Related Functions::.

   Differences with the ISO C99 standard:

   * In C, only quiet NaNs are specified, and a NaN propagation does not
     raise an invalid exception. Unless explicitly stated otherwise,
     MPFR sets the NaN flag whenever a NaN is generated, even when a
     NaN is propagated (e.g. in NaN + NaN), as if all NaNs were
     signaling.

   * An invalid exception in C corresponds to either a NaN exception or
     a range error in MPFR.


4.8 Memory Handling
===================

MPFR functions may create caches, e.g. when computing constants such as
Pi, either because the user has called a function like `mpfr_const_pi'
directly or because such a function was called internally by the MPFR
library itself to compute some other function.

   At any time, the user can free the various caches with
`mpfr_free_cache'. It is strongly advised to do that before terminating
a thread, or before exiting when using tools like `valgrind' (to avoid
memory leaks being reported).

   MPFR internal data such as flags, the exponent range, the default
precision and rounding mode, and caches (i.e., data that are not
accessed via parameters) are either global (if MPFR has not been
compiled as thread safe) or per-thread (thread local storage).

5 MPFR Interface
****************

The floating-point functions expect arguments of type `mpfr_t'.

   The MPFR floating-point functions have an interface that is similar
to the GNU MP integer functions.  The function prefix for
floating-point operations is `mpfr_'.

   There is one significant characteristic of floating-point numbers
that has motivated a difference between this function class and other
GNU MP function classes: the inherent inexactness of floating-point
arithmetic.  The user has to specify the precision for each variable.
A computation that assigns a variable will take place with the
precision of the assigned variable; the cost of that computation should
not depend from the precision of variables used as input (on average).

   The semantics of a calculation in MPFR is specified as follows:
Compute the requested operation exactly (with "infinite accuracy"), and
round the result to the precision of the destination variable, with the
given rounding mode.  The MPFR floating-point functions are intended to
be a smooth extension of the IEEE 754 arithmetic. The results obtained
on one computer should not differ from the results obtained on a
computer with a different word size.

   MPFR does not keep track of the accuracy of a computation. This is
left to the user or to a higher layer.  As a consequence, if two
variables are used to store only a few significant bits, and their
product is stored in a variable with large precision, then MPFR will
still compute the result with full precision.

   The value of the standard C macro `errno' may be set to non-zero by
any MPFR function or macro, whether or not there is an error.

5.1 Initialization Functions
============================

An `mpfr_t' object must be initialized before storing the first value in
it.  The functions `mpfr_init' and `mpfr_init2' are used for that
purpose.

 -- Function: void mpfr_init2 (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Initialize X, set its precision to be *exactly* PREC bits and its
     value to NaN. (Warning: the corresponding `mpf' functions
     initialize to zero instead.)

     Normally, a variable should be initialized once only or at least
     be cleared, using `mpfr_clear', between initializations.  To
     change the precision of a variable which has already been
     initialized, use `mpfr_set_prec'.  The precision PREC must be an
     integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX' (otherwise the
     behavior is undefined).

 -- Function: void mpfr_inits2 (mp_prec_t PREC, mpfr_t X, ...)
     Initialize all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given `va_list', set
     their precision to be *exactly* PREC bits and their value to NaN.
     See `mpfr_init2' for more details.  The `va_list' is assumed to be
     composed only of type `mpfr_t' (or equivalently `mpfr_ptr').  It
     begins from X. It ends when it encounters a null pointer (whose
     type must also be `mpfr_ptr').

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear (mpfr_t X)
     Free the space occupied by X.  Make sure to call this function for
     all `mpfr_t' variables when you are done with them.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clears (mpfr_t X, ...)
     Free the space occupied by all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given
     `va_list'. See `mpfr_clear' for more details.  The `va_list' is
     assumed to be composed only of type `mpfr_t' (or equivalently
     `mpfr_ptr').  It begins from X. It ends when it encounters a null
     pointer (whose type must also be `mpfr_ptr').

   Here is an example of how to use multiple initialization functions:

     {
       mpfr_t x, y, z, t;
       mpfr_inits2 (256, x, y, z, t, (mpfr_ptr) 0);
       ...
       mpfr_clears (x, y, z, t, (mpfr_ptr) 0);
     }

 -- Function: void mpfr_init (mpfr_t X)
     Initialize X and set its value to NaN.

     Normally, a variable should be initialized once only or at least
     be cleared, using `mpfr_clear', between initializations.  The
     precision of X is the default precision, which can be changed by a
     call to `mpfr_set_default_prec'.

     Warning! In a given program, some other libraries might change the
     default precision and not restore it. Thus it is safer to use
     `mpfr_init2'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_inits (mpfr_t X, ...)
     Initialize all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given `va_list', set
     their precision to be the default precision and their value to NaN.
     See `mpfr_init' for more details.  The `va_list' is assumed to be
     composed only of type `mpfr_t' (or equivalently `mpfr_ptr').  It
     begins from X. It ends when it encounters a null pointer (whose
     type must also be `mpfr_ptr').

     Warning! In a given program, some other libraries might change the
     default precision and not restore it. Thus it is safer to use
     `mpfr_inits2'.

 -- Macro: MPFR_DECL_INIT (NAME, PREC)
     This macro declares NAME as an automatic variable of type `mpfr_t',
     initializes it and sets its precision to be *exactly* PREC bits
     and its value to NaN. NAME must be a valid identifier.  You must
     use this macro in the declaration section.  This macro is much
     faster than using `mpfr_init2' but has some drawbacks:

        * You *must not* call `mpfr_clear' with variables created with
          this macro (the storage is allocated at the point of
          declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited).

        * You *cannot* change their precision.

        * You *should not* create variables with huge precision with
          this macro.

        * Your compiler must support `Non-Constant Initializers'
          (standard in C++ and ISO C99) and `Token Pasting' (standard
          in ISO C89). If PREC is not a constant expression, your
          compiler must support `variable-length automatic arrays'
          (standard in ISO C99). `GCC 2.95.3' and above supports all
          these features.  If you compile your program with gcc in c89
          mode and with `-pedantic', you may want to define the
          `MPFR_USE_EXTENSION' macro to avoid warnings due to the
          `MPFR_DECL_INIT' implementation.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_default_prec (mp_prec_t PREC)
     Set the default precision to be *exactly* PREC bits.  The
     precision of a variable means the number of bits used to store its
     significand.  All subsequent calls to `mpfr_init' will use this
     precision, but previously initialized variables are unaffected.
     This default precision is set to 53 bits initially.  The precision
     can be any integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX'.

 -- Function: mp_prec_t mpfr_get_default_prec (void)
     Return the default MPFR precision in bits.

   Here is an example on how to initialize floating-point variables:

     {
       mpfr_t x, y;
       mpfr_init (x);                /* use default precision */
       mpfr_init2 (y, 256);          /* precision _exactly_ 256 bits */
       ...
       /* When the program is about to exit, do ... */
       mpfr_clear (x);
       mpfr_clear (y);
       mpfr_free_cache ();
     }

   The following functions are useful for changing the precision during
a calculation.  A typical use would be for adjusting the precision
gradually in iterative algorithms like Newton-Raphson, making the
computation precision closely match the actual accurate part of the
numbers.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_prec (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Reset the precision of X to be *exactly* PREC bits, and set its
     value to NaN.  The previous value stored in X is lost. It is
     equivalent to a call to `mpfr_clear(x)' followed by a call to
     `mpfr_init2(x, prec)', but more efficient as no allocation is done
     in case the current allocated space for the significand of X is
     enough.  The precision PREC can be any integer between
     `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX'.

     In case you want to keep the previous value stored in X, use
     `mpfr_prec_round' instead.

 -- Function: mp_prec_t mpfr_get_prec (mpfr_t X)
     Return the precision actually used for assignments of X, i.e. the
     number of bits used to store its significand.

5.2 Assignment Functions
========================

These functions assign new values to already initialized floats (*note
Initialization Functions::).

 -- Function: int mpfr_set (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ui (mpfr_t ROP, unsigned long int OP,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_si (mpfr_t ROP, long int OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_uj (mpfr_t ROP, uintmax_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_sj (mpfr_t ROP, intmax_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_d (mpfr_t ROP, double OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ld (mpfr_t ROP, long double OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_decimal64 (mpfr_t ROP, _Decimal64 OP,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_z (mpfr_t ROP, mpz_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_q (mpfr_t ROP, mpq_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_f (mpfr_t ROP, mpf_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP, rounded toward the given direction
     RND.  Note that the input 0 is converted to +0 by `mpfr_set_ui',
     `mpfr_set_si', `mpfr_set_sj', `mpfr_set_uj', `mpfr_set_z',
     `mpfr_set_q' and `mpfr_set_f', regardless of the rounding mode.
     If the system does not support the IEEE 754 standard, `mpfr_set_d',
     `mpfr_set_ld' and `mpfr_set_decimal64' might not preserve the
     signed zeros.  The `mpfr_set_decimal64' function is built only
     with the configure option `--enable-decimal-float', which also
     requires `--with-gmp-build', and when the compiler or system
     provides the `_Decimal64' data type (GCC version 4.2.0 is known to
     support this data type, but only when configured with
     `--enable-decimal-float' too).  `mpfr_set_q' might not be able to
     work if the numerator (or the denominator) can not be
     representable as a `mpfr_t'.

     Note: If you want to store a floating-point constant to a `mpfr_t',
     you should use `mpfr_set_str' (or one of the MPFR constant
     functions, such as `mpfr_const_pi' for Pi) instead of `mpfr_set_d',
     `mpfr_set_ld' or `mpfr_set_decimal64'.  Otherwise the
     floating-point constant will be first converted into a
     reduced-precision (e.g., 53-bit) binary number before MPFR can
     work with it.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ui_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, unsigned long int OP,
          mp_exp_t E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_si_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, long int OP, mp_exp_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_uj_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, uintmax_t OP, intmax_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_sj_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, intmax_t OP, intmax_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP multiplied by two to the power E,
     rounded toward the given direction RND.  Note that the input 0 is
     converted to +0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_str (mpfr_t ROP, const char *S, int BASE,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the value of the string S in base BASE, rounded in the
     direction RND.  See the documentation of `mpfr_strtofr' for a
     detailed description of the valid string formats.  Contrary to
     `mpfr_strtofr', `mpfr_set_str' requires the _whole_ string to
     represent a valid floating-point number.  This function returns 0
     if the entire string up to the final null character is a valid
     number in base BASE; otherwise it returns -1, and ROP may have
     changed.

 -- Function: int mpfr_strtofr (mpfr_t ROP, const char *NPTR, char
          **ENDPTR, int BASE, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Read a floating-point number from a string NPTR in base BASE,
     rounded in the direction RND; BASE must be either 0 (to detect the
     base, as described below) or a number from 2 to 36 (otherwise the
     behavior is undefined). If NPTR starts with valid data, the result
     is stored in ROP and `*ENDPTR' points to the character just after
     the valid data (if ENDPTR is not a null pointer); otherwise ROP is
     set to zero and the value of NPTR is stored in the location
     referenced by ENDPTR (if ENDPTR is not a null pointer). The usual
     ternary value is returned.

     Parsing follows the standard C `strtod' function with some
     extensions.  Case is ignored. After optional leading whitespace,
     one has a subject sequence consisting of an optional sign (`+' or
     `-'), and either numeric data or special data. The subject
     sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the
     input string, starting with the first non-whitespace character,
     that is of the expected form.

     The form of numeric data is a non-empty sequence of significand
     digits with an optional decimal point, and an optional exponent
     consisting of an exponent prefix followed by an optional sign and
     a non-empty sequence of decimal digits. A significand digit is
     either a decimal digit or a Latin letter (62 possible characters),
     with `a' = 10, `b' = 11, ..., `z' = 35; its value must be strictly
     less than the base.  The decimal point can be either the one
     defined by the current locale or the period (the first one is
     accepted for consistency with the C standard and the practice, the
     second one is accepted to allow the programmer to provide MPFR
     numbers from strings in a way that does not depend on the current
     locale).  The exponent prefix can be `e' or `E' for bases up to
     10, or `@' in any base; it indicates a multiplication by a power
     of the base. In bases 2 and 16, the exponent prefix can also be
     `p' or `P', in which case it introduces a binary exponent: it
     indicates a multiplication by a power of 2 (there is a difference
     only for base 16).  The value of an exponent is always written in
     base 10.  In base 2, the significand can start with `0b' or `0B',
     and in base 16, it can start with `0x' or `0X'.

     If the argument BASE is 0, then the base is automatically detected
     as follows. If the significand starts with `0b' or `0B', base 2 is
     assumed. If the significand starts with `0x' or `0X', base 16 is
     assumed. Otherwise base 10 is assumed.

     Note: The exponent must contain at least a digit. Otherwise the
     possible exponent prefix and sign are not part of the number
     (which ends with the significand). Similarly, if `0b', `0B', `0x'
     or `0X' is not followed by a binary/hexadecimal digit, then the
     subject sequence stops at the character `0'.

     Special data (for infinities and NaN) can be `@inf@' or
     `@nan@(n-char-sequence)', and if BASE <= 16, it can also be
     `infinity', `inf', `nan' or `nan(n-char-sequence-opt)', all case
     insensitive.  A `n-char-sequence-opt' is a possibly empty string
     containing only digits, Latin letters and the underscore (0, 1, 2,
     ..., 9, a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z, _). Note: one has an optional
     sign for all data, even NaN.


 -- Function: void mpfr_set_inf (mpfr_t X, int SIGN)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_nan (mpfr_t X)
     Set the variable X to infinity or NaN (Not-a-Number) respectively.
     In `mpfr_set_inf', X is set to plus infinity iff SIGN is
     nonnegative.

 -- Function: void mpfr_swap (mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y)
     Swap the values X and Y efficiently. Warning: the precisions are
     exchanged too; in case the precisions are different, `mpfr_swap'
     is thus not equivalent to three `mpfr_set' calls using a third
     auxiliary variable.

5.4 Conversion Functions
========================

 -- Function: double mpfr_get_d (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: long double mpfr_get_ld (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: _Decimal64 mpfr_get_decimal64 (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `double' (respectively `_Decimal64' or `long
     double'), using the rounding mode RND.  If OP is NaN, some fixed
     NaN (either quiet or signaling) or the result of 0.0/0.0 is
     returned. If OP is ±Inf, an infinity of the same sign or the
     result of ±1.0/0.0 is returned. If OP is zero, these functions
     return a zero, trying to preserve its sign, if possible.  The
     `mpfr_get_decimal64' function is built only under some conditions:
     see the documentation of `mpfr_set_decimal64'.

 -- Function: double mpfr_get_d_2exp (long *EXP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
 -- Function: long double mpfr_get_ld_2exp (long *EXP, mpfr_t OP,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Return D and set EXP such that 0.5<=abs(D)<1 and D times 2 raised
     to EXP equals OP rounded to double (resp. long double) precision,
     using the given rounding mode.  If OP is zero, then a zero of the
     same sign (or an unsigned zero, if the implementation does not
     have signed zeros) is returned, and EXP is set to 0.  If OP is NaN
     or an infinity, then the corresponding double precision (resp.
     long-double precision) value is returned, and EXP is undefined.

 -- Function: long mpfr_get_si (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: unsigned long mpfr_get_ui (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: intmax_t mpfr_get_sj (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: uintmax_t mpfr_get_uj (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `long', an `unsigned long', an `intmax_t' or an
     `uintmax_t' (respectively) after rounding it with respect to RND.
     If OP is NaN, the result is undefined.  If OP is too big for the
     return type, it returns the maximum or the minimum of the
     corresponding C type, depending on the direction of the overflow.
     The _erange_ flag is set too.  See also `mpfr_fits_slong_p',
     `mpfr_fits_ulong_p', `mpfr_fits_intmax_p' and
     `mpfr_fits_uintmax_p'.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_z_exp (mpz_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
     Put the scaled significand of OP (regarded as an integer, with the
     precision of OP) into ROP, and return the exponent EXP (which may
     be outside the current exponent range) such that OP exactly equals
     ROP multiplied by two exponent EXP.  If OP is zero, the minimal
     exponent `emin' is returned.  If the exponent is not representable
     in the `mp_exp_t' type, the behavior is undefined.

 -- Function: void mpfr_get_z (mpz_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `mpz_t', after rounding it with respect to RND. If
     OP is NaN or Inf, the result is undefined.

 -- Function: int mpfr_get_f (mpf_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `mpf_t', after rounding it with respect to RND.
     Return zero iff no error occurred, in particular a non-zero value
     is returned if OP is NaN or Inf, which do not exist in `mpf'.

 -- Function: char * mpfr_get_str (char *STR, mp_exp_t *EXPPTR, int B,
          size_t N, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a string of digits in base B, with rounding in the
     direction RND, where N is either zero (see below) or the number of
     significant digits; in the latter case, N must be greater or equal
     to 2. The base may vary from 2 to 36.

     The generated string is a fraction, with an implicit radix point
     immediately to the left of the first digit.  For example, the
     number -3.1416 would be returned as "-31416" in the string and 1
     written at EXPPTR.  If RND is to nearest, and OP is exactly in the
     middle of two possible outputs, the one with an even significand
     is chosen: that significand is considered with the exponent of OP.
     Note that for an odd base, this may not correspond to an even last
     digit: for example with 2 digits in base 7, 16 and a half is
     rounded to 20 which is 14 in decimal, 36 and a half is rounded to
     40 which is 28 in decimal, and 66 and a half is rounded to 66
     which is 48 in decimal.

     If N is zero, the number of digits of the significand is chosen
     large enough so that re-reading the printed value with the same
     precision, assuming both output and input use rounding to nearest,
     will recover the original value of OP.  More precisely, in most
     cases, the chosen precision of STR is the minimal precision
     depending on P = PREC(OP) and B only that satisfies the above
     property, i.e., m = 1 + ceil(P*log(2)/log(B)), with P replaced by
     P-1 if B is a power of 2, but in some very rare cases, it might be
     m+1 (the smallest case for bases up to 62 is when P equals
     186564318007 for bases 7 and 49).

     If STR is a null pointer, space for the significand is allocated
     using the current allocation function, and a pointer to the string
     is returned.  To free the returned string, you must use
     `mpfr_free_str'.

     If STR is not a null pointer, it should point to a block of storage
     large enough for the significand, i.e., at least `max(N + 2, 7)'.
     The extra two bytes are for a possible minus sign, and for the
     terminating null character.

     If the input number is an ordinary number, the exponent is written
     through the pointer EXPPTR (the current minimal exponent for 0).

     A pointer to the string is returned, unless there is an error, in
     which case a null pointer is returned.

 -- Function: void mpfr_free_str (char *STR)
     Free a string allocated by `mpfr_get_str' using the current
     unallocation function (preliminary interface).  The block is
     assumed to be `strlen(STR)+1' bytes.  For more information about
     how it is done: *note Custom Allocation: (gmp.info)Custom
     Allocation.

          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP1 + OP2 rounded in the direction RND. For types
     having no signed zero, it is considered unsigned (i.e. (+0) + 0 =
     (+0) and (-0) + 0 = (-0)).  The `mpfr_add_d' function assumes that
     the radix of the `double' type is a power of 2, with a precision
     at most that declared by the C implementation (macro
     `IEEE_DBL_MANT_DIG', and if not defined 53 bits).

          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP1 - OP2 rounded in the direction RND. For types
     having no signed zero, it is considered unsigned (i.e. (+0) - 0 =
     (+0), (-0) - 0 = (-0), 0 - (+0) = (-0) and 0 - (-0) = (+0)).  The
     same restrictions than for `mpfr_add_d' apply to `mpfr_d_sub' and
     `mpfr_sub_d'.

          mp_rnd_t RND)

          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP1 times OP2 rounded in the direction RND.  When a
     result is zero, its sign is the product of the signs of the
     operands (for types having no signed zero, it is considered
     positive).  The same restrictions than for `mpfr_add_d' apply to
     `mpfr_mul_d'.

     Set ROP to the square of OP rounded in the direction RND.

          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP1/OP2 rounded in the direction RND.  When a result is
     zero, its sign is the product of the signs of the operands (for
     types having no signed zero, it is considered positive).  The same
     restrictions than for `mpfr_add_d' apply to `mpfr_d_div' and

 -- Function: int mpfr_rec_sqrt (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the reciprocal square root of OP rounded in the
     direction RND. Return +Inf if OP is ±0, and +0 if OP is +Inf.  Set
     ROP to NaN if OP is negative.

 -- Function: int mpfr_cbrt (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_root (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, unsigned long int
          K, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the cubic root (resp. the Kth root) of OP rounded in
     the direction RND.  An odd (resp. even) root of a negative number
     (including -Inf) returns a negative number (resp. NaN).  The Kth
     root of -0 is defined to be -0, whatever the parity of K.

 -- Function: int mpfr_pow (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,

 -- Function: int mpfr_cmp_q (mpfr_t OP1, mpq_t OP2)
 -- Function: int mpfr_cmp_f (mpfr_t OP1, mpf_t OP2)
     Compare OP1 and OP2.  Return a positive value if OP1 > OP2, zero
     if OP1 = OP2, and a negative value if OP1 < OP2.  Both OP1 and OP2
     are considered to their full own precision, which may differ.  If
     one of the operands is NaN, set the _erange_ flag and return zero.

     Note: These functions may be useful to distinguish the three
     possible cases.  If you need to distinguish two cases only, it is
     recommended to use the predicate functions (e.g., `mpfr_equal_p'
     for the equality) described below; they behave like the IEEE 754
     comparisons, in particular when one or both arguments are NaN. But
     only floating-point numbers can be compared (you may need to do a
     conversion first).

 -- Function: int mpfr_cmp_ui_2exp (mpfr_t OP1, unsigned long int OP2,

     above.

     |OP2|, zero if |OP1| = |OP2|, and a negative value if |OP1| <

     return zero.

     otherwise.

     value if OP < 0.  If the operand is NaN, set the _erange_ flag and
     return zero.

     Return non-zero if OP1 > OP2, zero otherwise.

     are NaN, or OP1 = OP2).

 -- Function: int mpfr_equal_p (mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2)
     Return non-zero if OP1 = OP2, zero otherwise (i.e. OP1 and/or OP2
     are NaN, or OP1 <> OP2).

 -- Function: int mpfr_unordered_p (mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2)
     Return non-zero if OP1 or OP2 is a NaN (i.e. they cannot be
     compared), zero otherwise.

5.7 Special Functions
=====================

All those functions, except explicitly stated, return zero for an exact
return value, a positive value for a return value larger than the exact
result, and a negative value otherwise.

   Important note: in some domains, computing special functions (either
with correct or incorrect rounding) is expensive, even for small
precision, for example the trigonometric and Bessel functions for large
argument.

 -- Function: int mpfr_log (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_log2 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)

     Set ROP to the natural logarithm of OP, log2(OP) or log10(OP),
     respectively, rounded in the direction RND.  Return -Inf if OP is
     -0 (i.e. the sign of the zero has no influence on the result).

 -- Function: int mpfr_exp (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_exp2 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_exp10 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the exponential of OP,  to 2 power of OP or to 10 power
     of OP, respectively, rounded in the direction RND.

 -- Function: int mpfr_cos (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_sin (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)

     rounded in the direction RND.

          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set simultaneously SOP to the sine of OP and
     COP to the cosine of OP, rounded in the direction RND with the
     corresponding precisions of SOP and COP, which must be different
     variables.  Return 0 iff both results are exact.

 -- Function: int mpfr_acos (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_asin (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)

     Set ROP to the arc-cosine, arc-sine or arc-tangent of OP, rounded
     in the direction RND.  Note that since `acos(-1)' returns the
     floating-point number closest to Pi according to the given
     rounding mode, this number might not be in the output range 0 <=
     ROP < \pi of the arc-cosine function; still, the result lies in
     the image of the output range by the rounding function.  The same
     holds for `asin(-1)', `asin(1)', `atan(-Inf)', `atan(+Inf)'.

 -- Function: int mpfr_atan2 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t Y, mpfr_t X, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Set ROP to the arc-tangent2 of Y and X, rounded in the direction
     RND: if `x > 0', `atan2(y, x) = atan (y/x)'; if `x < 0', `atan2(y,
     x) = sign(y)*(Pi - atan (abs(y/x)))'.  As for `atan', in case the
     exact mathematical result is +Pi or -Pi, its rounded result might
     be outside the function output range.

     `atan2(y, 0)' does not raise any floating-point exception.
     Special values are currently handled as described in the ISO C99
     standard for the `atan2' function (note this may change in future
     versions):
        * `atan2(+0, -0)' returns +Pi.

        * `atan2(-0, -0)' returns -Pi.

        * `atan2(-0, x)' returns -Pi for x < 0.

        * `atan2(+0, x)' returns +0 for x > 0.

        * `atan2(-0, x)' returns -0 for x > 0.

        * `atan2(y, 0)' returns -Pi/2 for y < 0.

        * `atan2(y, 0)' returns +Pi/2 for y > 0.

        * `atan2(+Inf, -Inf)' returns +3*Pi/4.

        * `atan2(-Inf, -Inf)' returns -3*Pi/4.

        * `atan2(+Inf, +Inf)' returns +Pi/4.

        * `atan2(+Inf, x)' returns +Pi/2 for finite x.

        * `atan2(-Inf, x)' returns -Pi/2 for finite x.

        * `atan2(y, -Inf)' returns +Pi for finite y > 0.

        * `atan2(y, -Inf)' returns -Pi for finite y < 0.

        * `atan2(y, +Inf)' returns +0 for finite y > 0.

        * `atan2(y, +Inf)' returns -0 for finite y < 0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_eint (mpfr_t Y, mpfr_t X, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set Y to the exponential integral of X, rounded in the direction

     Euler's constant, of the logarithm of X, and of the sum for k from
     1 to infinity of X to the power k, divided by k and factorial(k).
     For negative X, the returned value is NaN.

     Set ROP to the value of the logarithm of the Gamma function on OP,
     rounded in the direction RND.  When -2K-1 <= X <= -2K, K being a
     non-negative integer, NaN is returned.  See also `mpfr_lgamma'.

     When OP is an infinity or a non-positive integer, +Inf is
     returned. When OP is NaN, -Inf or a negative integer, *SIGNP is
     undefined, and when OP is ±0, *SIGNP is the sign of the zero.

     Set ROP to the value of the first kind Bessel function of order 0,
     1 and N on OP, rounded in the direction RND. When OP is NaN, ROP
     is always set to NaN. When OP is plus or minus Infinity, ROP is
     set to +0. When OP is zero, and N is not zero, ROP is +0 or -0
     depending on the parity and sign of N, and the sign of OP.

 -- Function: int mpfr_y0 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_y1 (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)

 -- Function: int mpfr_agm (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the arithmetic-geometric mean of OP1 and OP2, rounded
     in the direction RND.  The arithmetic-geometric mean is the common
     limit of the sequences u[n] and v[n], where u[0]=OP1, v[0]=OP2,
     u[n+1] is the arithmetic mean of u[n] and v[n], and v[n+1] is the
     geometric mean of u[n] and v[n].  If any operand is negative, the
     return value is NaN.

 -- Function: int mpfr_hypot (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Set ROP to the Euclidean norm of X and Y, i.e. the square root of
     the sum of the squares of X and Y, rounded in the direction RND.
     Special values are currently handled as described in Section
     F.9.4.3 of the ISO C99 standard, for the `hypot' function (note
     this may change in future versions): If X or Y is an infinity,
     then plus infinity is returned in ROP, even if the other number is
     NaN.

 -- Function: int mpfr_const_log2 (mpfr_t ROP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_const_pi (mpfr_t ROP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_const_euler (mpfr_t ROP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_const_catalan (mpfr_t ROP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the logarithm of 2, the value of Pi, of Euler's
     constant 0.577..., of Catalan's constant 0.915..., respectively,
     rounded in the direction RND. These functions cache the computed
     values to avoid other calculations if a lower or equal precision
     is requested. To free these caches, use `mpfr_free_cache'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_free_cache (void)
     Free various caches used by MPFR internally, in particular the
     caches used by the functions computing constants (currently
     `mpfr_const_log2', `mpfr_const_pi', `mpfr_const_euler' and
     `mpfr_const_catalan').  You should call this function before
     terminating a thread, even if you did not call these functions
     directly (they could have been called internally).

 -- Function: int mpfr_sum (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_ptr const TAB[], unsigned
          long N, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the sum of all elements of TAB, whose size is N,
     rounded in the direction RND. Warning, TAB is a table of pointers
     to mpfr_t, not a table of mpfr_t (preliminary interface). If the
     returned `int' value is zero, ROP is guaranteed to be the exact
     sum; otherwise ROP might be smaller than, equal to, or larger than
     the exact sum (in accordance to the rounding mode).  However,
     `mpfr_sum' does guarantee the result is correctly rounded.

5.8 Input and Output Functions
==============================

This section describes functions that perform input from an input/output
stream, and functions that output to an input/output stream.  Passing a
null pointer for a `stream' to any of these functions will make them
read from `stdin' and write to `stdout', respectively.

   When using any of these functions, you must include the `<stdio.h>'
standard header before `mpfr.h', to allow `mpfr.h' to define prototypes
for these functions.

 -- Function: size_t mpfr_out_str (FILE *STREAM, int BASE, size_t N,
          mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Output OP on stream STREAM, as a string of digits in base BASE,
     rounded in the direction RND.  The base may vary from 2 to 36.
     Print N significant digits exactly, or if N is 0, enough digits so
     that OP can be read back exactly (see `mpfr_get_str').

     In addition to the significant digits, a decimal point (defined by
     the current locale) at the right of the first digit and a trailing
     exponent in base 10, in the form `eNNN', are printed. If BASE is
     greater than 10, `@' will be used instead of `e' as exponent
     delimiter.

     Return the number of bytes written, or if an error occurred,
     return 0.

 -- Function: size_t mpfr_inp_str (mpfr_t ROP, FILE *STREAM, int BASE,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Input a string in base BASE from stream STREAM, rounded in the
     direction RND, and put the read float in ROP.

     This function reads a word (defined as a sequence of characters
     between whitespace) and parses it using `mpfr_set_str' (it may
     change).  See the documentation of `mpfr_strtofr' for a detailed
     description of the valid string formats.

     Return the number of bytes read, or if an error occurred, return 0.

5.9 Formatted Output Functions
==============================

5.9.1 Requirements
------------------

The class of `mpfr_printf' functions provides formatted output in a
similar manner as the standard C `printf'. These functions are defined
only if your system supports ISO C variadic functions and the
corresponding argument access macros.

   When using any of these functions, you must include the `<stdio.h>'
standard header before `mpfr.h', to allow `mpfr.h' to define prototypes
for these functions.

5.9.2 Format String
-------------------

The format specification accepted by `mpfr_printf' is an extension of
the `printf' one. The conversion specification is of the form:
     % [flags] [width] [.[precision]] [type] [rounding] conv
   `flags', `width', and `precision' have the same meaning as for the
standard `printf' (in particular, notice that the `precision' is
related to the number of digits displayed in the base chosen by `conv'
and not related to the internal precision of the `mpfr_t' variable).
`mpfr_printf' accepts the same `type' specifiers as GMP (except the
non-standard and deprecated `q', use `ll' instead), plus `R' and `P':

     `h'       `short'
     `hh'      `char'
     `j'       `intmax_t' or `uintmax_t'
     `l'       `long' or `wchar_t'
     `ll'      `long long'
     `L'       `long double'
     `t'       `ptrdiff_t'
     `z'       `size_t'
     `F'       `mpf_t', float conversions
     `Q'       `mpq_t', integer conversions
     `M'       `mp_limb_t', integer conversions
     `N'       `mp_limb_t' array, integer conversions
     `Z'       `mpz_t', integer conversions
     `P'       `mp_prec_t', integer conversions
     `R'       `mpfr_t', float conversions

   The `type' specifiers have the same restrictions as those mentioned
in the GMP documentation: *note Formatted Output Strings:
(gmp.info)Formatted Output Strings.  In particular, the `type'
specifiers (except `R' and `P' defined by MPFR) are supported only if
they are supported by `gmp_printf' in your GMP build; this implies that
the standard specifiers, such as `t', must _also_ be supported by your
C library if you want to use them.

   The `rounding' field is specific to `mpfr_t' arguments and should
not be used with other types.

   With conversion specification not involving `P' and `R' types,
`mpfr_printf' behaves exactly as `gmp_printf'.

   The `P' type specifies that a following `o', `u', `x', or `X'
conversion specifier applies to a `mp_prec_t' argument.  It is needed
because the `mp_prec_t' type does not necessarily correspond to an
`unsigned int' or any fixed standard type.  The `precision' field
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear. The default
`precision' is 1.  For example:
     mpfr_t x;
     mp_prec_t p;
     mpfr_init (x);
     ...
     p = mpfr_get_prec (x);
     mpfr_printf ("variable x with %Pu bits", p);

   The `R' type specifies that a following `a', `A', `b', `e', `E',
`f', `F', `g', `G', or `n' conversion specifier applies to a `mpfr_t'
argument.  The `R' type can be followed by a `rounding' specifier
denoted by one of the following characters:

     `U'       round toward plus infinity
     `D'       round toward minus infinity
     `Z'       round toward zero
     `N'       round to nearest
     `*'       rounding mode indicated by the
               `mp_rnd_t' argument just before the
               corresponding `mpfr_t' variable.

   The default rounding mode is rounding to nearest.  The following
three examples are equivalent:
     mpfr_t x;
     mpfr_init (x);
     ...
     mpfr_printf ("%.128Rf", x);
     mpfr_printf ("%.128RNf", x);
     mpfr_printf ("%.128R*f", GMP_RNDN, x);

   The output `conv' specifiers allowed with `mpfr_t' parameter are:

     `a' `A'   hex float, C99 style
     `b'       binary output
     `e' `E'   scientific format float
     `f' `F'   fixed point float
     `g' `G'   fixed or scientific float

   The conversion specifier `b' which displays the argument in binary is
specific to `mpfr_t' arguments and should not be used with other types.
Other conversion specifiers have the same meaning as for a `double'
argument.

   In case of non-decimal output, only the significand is written in the
specified base, the exponent is always displayed in decimal.  Special
values are always displayed as `nan', `-inf', and `inf' for `a', `b',
`e', `f', and `g' specifiers and `NAN', `-INF', and `INF' for `A', `E',
`F', and `G' specifiers.

   If the `precision' field is not empty, the `mpfr_t' number is
rounded to the given precision in the direction specified by the
rounding mode.  If the precision is zero with rounding to nearest mode
and one of the following `conv' specifier: `a', `A', `b', `e', `E', tie
case is rounded to even when it lies between two values at the wanted
precision which have the same exponent, otherwise, it is rounded away
from zero.  For instance, 85 is displayed as "8e+1" and 95 is displayed
as "1e+2" with the format specification `"%.0RNe"'.  This also applies
when the `g' (resp. `G') conversion specifier uses the `e' (resp. `E')
style.  If the precision is set to a value greater than the maximum
value for an `int', it will be silently reduced down to `INT_MAX'.

   If the `precision' field is empty (as in `%Re' or `%.Re') with
`conv' specifier `e' and `E', the number is displayed with enough
digits so that it can be read back exactly, assuming that the input and
output variables have the same precision and that the input and output
rounding modes are both rounding to nearest (as for `mpfr_get_str').
The default precision for an empty `precision' field with `conv'
specifiers `f', `F', `g', and `G' is 6.

5.9.3 Functions
---------------

 -- Function: int mpfr_fprintf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Function: int mpfr_vfprintf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     Print to the stream STREAM the optional arguments under the
     control of the template string TEMPLATE.

     Return the number of characters written or a negative value if an
     error occurred. If the number of characters which ought to be
     written appears to exceed the maximum limit for an `int', nothing
     is written in the stream, the function returns -1, sets the
     _erange_ flag, and (in POSIX system only) `errno' is set to
     `EOVERFLOW'.

 -- Function: int mpfr_printf (const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Function: int mpfr_vprintf (const char *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     Print to `stdout' the optional arguments under the control of the
     template string TEMPLATE.

     Return the number of characters written or a negative value if an
     error occurred. If the number of characters which ought to be
     written appears to exceed the maximum limit for an `int', nothing
     is written in `stdout', the function returns -1, sets the _erange_
     flag, and (in POSIX system only) `errno' is set to `EOVERFLOW'.

 -- Function: int mpfr_sprintf (char *BUF, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Function: int mpfr_vsprintf (char *BUF, const char *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     Form a null-terminated string in BUF. No overlap is permitted
     between BUF and the other arguments.

     Return the number of characters written in the array BUF not
     counting the terminating null character or a negative value if an
     error occurred. If the number of characters which ought to be
     written appears to exceed the maximum limit for an `int', nothing
     is written in BUF, the function returns -1, sets the _erange_
     flag, and (in POSIX system only) `errno' is set to `EOVERFLOW'.

 -- Function: int mpfr_snprintf (char *BUF, size_t N, const char
          *TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Function: int mpfr_vsnprintf (char *BUF, size_t N, const char
          *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     Form a null-terminated string in BUF. If N is zero, nothing is
     written and BUF may be a null pointer, otherwise, the `n-1' first
     characters are written in BUF and the N-th is a null character.

     Return the number of characters that would have been written had N
     be sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character
     or a negative value if an error occurred. If the number of
     characters produced by the optional arguments under the control of
     the template string TEMPLATE appears to exceed the maximum limit
     for an `int', nothing is written in BUF, the function returns -1,
     sets the _erange_ flag, and (in POSIX system only) `errno' is set
     to `EOVERFLOW'.

 -- Function: int mpfr_asprintf (char **STR, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Function: int mpfr_vasprintf (char **STR, const char *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     Write their output as a null terminated string in a block of
     memory allocated using the current allocation function. A pointer
     to the block is stored in STR. The block of memory must be freed
     using `mpfr_free_str'.

     The return value is the number of characters written in the
     string, excluding the null-terminator or a negative value if an
     error occurred. If the number of characters produced by the
     optional arguments under the control of the template string
     TEMPLATE appears to exceed the maximum limit for an `int', STR is
     a null pointer, the function returns -1, sets the _erange_ flag,
     and (in POSIX system only) `errno' is set to `EOVERFLOW'.

5.10 Integer and Remainder Related Functions
============================================

 -- Function: int mpfr_rint (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_ceil (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_floor (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_round (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_trunc (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
     Set ROP to OP rounded to an integer.  `mpfr_rint' rounds to the
     nearest representable integer in the given rounding mode,
     `mpfr_ceil' rounds to the next higher or equal representable
     integer, `mpfr_floor' to the next lower or equal representable
     integer, `mpfr_round' to the nearest representable integer,
     rounding halfway cases away from zero (as in the roundTiesToAway
     mode of IEEE 754-2008), and `mpfr_trunc' to the next representable
     integer toward zero.

     The returned value is zero when the result is exact, positive when
     it is greater than the original value of OP, and negative when it
     is smaller.  More precisely, the returned value is 0 when OP is an
     integer representable in ROP, 1 or -1 when OP is an integer that
     is not representable in ROP, 2 or -2 when OP is not an integer.

     Note that `mpfr_round' is different from `mpfr_rint' called with
     the rounding to nearest mode (where halfway cases are rounded to
     an even integer or significand). Note also that no double rounding
     is performed; for instance, 4.5 (100.1 in binary) is rounded by
     `mpfr_round' to 4 (100 in binary) in 2-bit precision, though
     `round(4.5)' is equal to 5 and 5 (101 in binary) is rounded to 6
     (110 in binary) in 2-bit precision.

 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_ceil (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_floor (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_round (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_trunc (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP rounded to an integer.  `mpfr_rint_ceil' rounds to
     the next higher or equal integer, `mpfr_rint_floor' to the next
     lower or equal integer, `mpfr_rint_round' to the nearest integer,
     rounding halfway cases away from zero, and `mpfr_rint_trunc' to
     the next integer toward zero.  If the result is not representable,
     it is rounded in the direction RND.  The returned value is the
     ternary value associated with the considered round-to-integer
     function (regarded in the same way as any other mathematical
     function).

 -- Function: int mpfr_frac (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the fractional part of OP, having the same sign as OP,
     rounded in the direction RND (unlike in `mpfr_rint', RND affects
     only how the exact fractional part is rounded, not how the
     fractional part is generated).

 -- Function: int mpfr_modf (mpfr_t IOP, mpfr_t FOP, mpfr_t OP,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set simultaneously IOP to the integral part of OP and FOP to the
     fractional part of OP, rounded in the direction RND with the
     corresponding precision of IOP and FOP (equivalent to
     `mpfr_trunc(IOP, OP, RND)' and `mpfr_frac(FOP, OP, RND)'). The
     variables IOP and FOP must be different. Return 0 iff both results
     are exact.

 -- Function: int mpfr_fmod (mpfr_t R, mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_remainder (mpfr_t R, mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_remquo (mpfr_t R, long* Q, mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set R to the value of x - n y, rounded according to the direction
     RND, where n is the integer quotient of X divided by Y, defined as
     follows: n is rounded toward zero for `mpfr_fmod', and to the
     nearest integer (ties rounded to even) for `mpfr_remainder' and
     `mpfr_remquo'.

     Special values are handled as described in Section F.9.7.1 of the
     ISO C99 standard: If X is infinite or Y is zero, R is NaN.  If Y
     is infinite and X is finite, R is X rounded to the precision of R.
     If R is zero, it has the sign of X.  The return value is the
     ternary value corresponding to R.

     Additionally, `mpfr_remquo' stores the low significant bits from
     the quotient in *Q (more precisely the number of bits in a `long'
     minus one), with the sign of X divided by Y (except if those low
     bits are all zero, in which case zero is returned).  Note that X
     may be so large in magnitude relative to Y that an exact
     representation of the quotient is not practical.  `mpfr_remainder'
     and `mpfr_remquo' functions are useful for additive argument
     reduction.

 -- Function: int mpfr_integer_p (mpfr_t OP)
     Return non-zero iff OP is an integer.

===============================

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode (mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the default rounding mode to RND.  The default rounding mode
     is to nearest initially.

 -- Function: mp_rnd_t mpfr_get_default_rounding_mode (void)
     Get the default rounding mode.

 -- Function: int mpfr_prec_round (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Round X according to RND with precision PREC, which must be an
     integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX' (otherwise the
     behavior is undefined).  If PREC is greater or equal to the
     precision of X, then new space is allocated for the significand,
     and it is filled with zeros.  Otherwise, the significand is
     rounded to precision PREC with the given direction. In both cases,
     the precision of X is changed to PREC.

 -- Function: int mpfr_round_prec (mpfr_t X, mp_rnd_t RND, mp_prec_t
          PREC)
     [This function is obsolete. Please use `mpfr_prec_round' instead.]

 -- Function: int mpfr_can_round (mpfr_t B, mp_exp_t ERR, mp_rnd_t
          RND1, mp_rnd_t RND2, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Assuming B is an approximation of an unknown number X in the
     direction RND1 with error at most two to the power E(b)-ERR where
     E(b) is the exponent of B, return a non-zero value if one is able
     to round correctly X to precision PREC with the direction RND2,
     and 0 otherwise (including for NaN and Inf).  This function *does
     not modify* its arguments.

     Note: if one wants to also determine the correct ternary value
     when rounding B to precision PREC, a useful trick is the following:    if (mpfr_can_round (b, err, rnd1, GMP_RNDZ, prec + (rnd2 == GMP_RNDN)))
           ...
      Indeed, if RND2 is `GMP_RNDN', this will check if one can round
     to PREC+1 bits with a directed rounding: if so, one can surely
     round to nearest to PREC bits, and in addition one can determine
     the correct ternary value, which would not be the case when B is
     near from a value exactly representable on PREC bits.

 -- Function: const char * mpfr_print_rnd_mode (mp_rnd_t RND)
     Return the input string (GMP_RNDD, GMP_RNDU, GMP_RNDN, GMP_RNDZ)
     corresponding to the rounding mode RND or a null pointer if RND is
     an invalid rounding mode.

5.12 Miscellaneous Functions
============================

 -- Function: void mpfr_nexttoward (mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y)
     If X or Y is NaN, set X to NaN. Otherwise, if X is different from
     Y, replace X by the next floating-point number (with the precision
     of X and the current exponent range) in the direction of Y, if
     there is one (the infinite values are seen as the smallest and
     largest floating-point numbers). If the result is zero, it keeps
     the same sign. No underflow or overflow is generated.

 -- Function: void mpfr_nextabove (mpfr_t X)
     Equivalent to `mpfr_nexttoward' where Y is plus infinity.

 -- Function: void mpfr_nextbelow (mpfr_t X)
     Equivalent to `mpfr_nexttoward' where Y is minus infinity.

 -- Function: int mpfr_min (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the minimum of OP1 and OP2. If OP1 and OP2 are both
     NaN, then ROP is set to NaN. If OP1 or OP2 is NaN, then ROP is set
     to the numeric value. If OP1 and OP2 are zeros of different signs,
     then ROP is set to -0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_max (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the maximum of OP1 and OP2. If OP1 and OP2 are both
     NaN, then ROP is set to NaN. If OP1 or OP2 is NaN, then ROP is set
     to the numeric value. If OP1 and OP2 are zeros of different signs,
     then ROP is set to +0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_urandomb (mpfr_t ROP, gmp_randstate_t STATE)
     Generate a uniformly distributed random float in the interval 0 <=
     ROP < 1. More precisely, the number can be seen as a float with a
     random non-normalized significand and exponent 0, which is then
     normalized (thus if E denotes the exponent after normalization,
     then the least -E significant bits of the significand are always
     0).  Return 0, unless the exponent is not in the current exponent
     range, in which case ROP is set to NaN and a non-zero value is
     returned (this should never happen in practice, except in very
     specific cases). The second argument is a `gmp_randstate_t'
     structure which should be created using the GMP `gmp_randinit'
     function, see the GMP manual.

 -- Function: void mpfr_random (mpfr_t ROP)
     Generate a uniformly distributed random float in the interval 0 <=
     ROP < 1.

     This function is deprecated and will be suppressed in the next
     release; `mpfr_urandomb' should be used instead.

 -- Function: void mpfr_random2 (mpfr_t ROP, mp_size_t SIZE, mp_exp_t
          EXP)
     Generate a random float of at most SIZE limbs, with long strings of
     zeros and ones in the binary representation. The exponent of the
     number is in the interval -EXP to EXP.  This function is useful for
     testing functions and algorithms, since this kind of random
     numbers have proven to be more likely to trigger corner-case bugs.
     Negative random numbers are generated when SIZE is negative.  Put
     +0 in ROP when size if zero. The internal state of the default
     pseudorandom number generator is modified by a call to this
     function (the same one as GMP if MPFR was built using
     `--with-gmp-build').

     This function is deprecated and will be suppressed in the next
     release.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_exp (mpfr_t X)
     Get the exponent of X, assuming that X is a non-zero ordinary
     number and the significand is chosen in [1/2,1). The behavior for
     NaN, infinity or zero is undefined.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_exp (mpfr_t X, mp_exp_t E)
     Set the exponent of X if E is in the current exponent range, and
     return 0 (even if X is not a non-zero ordinary number); otherwise,
     return a non-zero value.  The significand is assumed to be in
     [1/2,1).

 -- Function: int mpfr_signbit (mpfr_t OP)
     Return a non-zero value iff OP has its sign bit set (i.e. if it is
     negative, -0, or a NaN whose representation has its sign bit set).

 -- Function: int mpfr_setsign (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, int S, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP, rounded toward the given direction
     RND, then set (resp. clear) its sign bit if S is non-zero (resp.
     zero), even when OP is a NaN.

 -- Function: int mpfr_copysign (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP1, rounded toward the given direction
     RND, then set its sign bit to that of OP2 (even when OP1 or OP2 is
     a NaN). This function is equivalent to `mpfr_setsign (ROP, OP1,
     mpfr_signbit (OP2), RND)'.

 -- Function: const char * mpfr_get_version (void)
     Return the MPFR version, as a null-terminated string.

 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_MINOR
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_STRING
     `MPFR_VERSION' is the version of MPFR as a preprocessing constant.
     `MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR', `MPFR_VERSION_MINOR' and
     `MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL' are respectively the major, minor and
     patch level of MPFR version, as preprocessing constants.
     `MPFR_VERSION_STRING' is the version (with an optional suffix, used
     in development and pre-release versions) as a string constant,
     which can be compared to the result of `mpfr_get_version' to check
     at run time the header file and library used match:
          if (strcmp (mpfr_get_version (), MPFR_VERSION_STRING))
            fprintf (stderr, "Warning: header and library do not match\n");
     Note: Obtaining different strings is not necessarily an error, as
     in general, a program compiled with some old MPFR version can be
     dynamically linked with a newer MPFR library version (if allowed
     by the library versioning system).

 -- Macro: long MPFR_VERSION_NUM (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCHLEVEL)
     Create an integer in the same format as used by `MPFR_VERSION'
     from the given MAJOR, MINOR and PATCHLEVEL.  Here is an example of
     how to check the MPFR version at compile time:
          #if (!defined(MPFR_VERSION) || (MPFR_VERSION<MPFR_VERSION_NUM(2,1,0)))
          # error "Wrong MPFR version."
          #endif

 -- Function: const char * mpfr_get_patches (void)
     Return a null-terminated string containing the ids of the patches
     applied to the MPFR library (contents of the `PATCHES' file),
     separated by spaces.  Note: If the program has been compiled with
     an older MPFR version and is dynamically linked with a new MPFR
     library version, the ids of the patches applied to the old
     (compile-time) MPFR version are not available (however this
     information should not have much interest in general).

5.13 Exception Related Functions
================================

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax (void)
     Return the (current) smallest and largest exponents allowed for a
     floating-point variable. The smallest positive value of a
     floating-point variable is one half times 2 raised to the smallest
     exponent and the largest value has the form (1 - epsilon) times 2
     raised to the largest exponent.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_emin (mp_exp_t EXP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_emax (mp_exp_t EXP)
     Set the smallest and largest exponents allowed for a
     floating-point variable.  Return a non-zero value when EXP is not
     in the range accepted by the implementation (in that case the
     smallest or largest exponent is not changed), and zero otherwise.
     If the user changes the exponent range, it is her/his
     responsibility to check that all current floating-point variables
     are in the new allowed range (for example using
     `mpfr_check_range'), otherwise the subsequent behavior will be
     undefined, in the sense of the ISO C standard.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin_min (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin_max (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax_min (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax_max (void)
     Return the minimum and maximum of the smallest and largest
     exponents allowed for `mpfr_set_emin' and `mpfr_set_emax'. These
     values are implementation dependent; it is possible to create a non
     portable program by writing `mpfr_set_emax(mpfr_get_emax_max())'
     and `mpfr_set_emin(mpfr_get_emin_min())' since the values of the
     smallest and largest exponents become implementation dependent.

 -- Function: int mpfr_check_range (mpfr_t X, int T, mp_rnd_t RND)
     This function forces X to be in the current range of acceptable
     values, T being the current ternary value: negative if X is
     smaller than the exact value, positive if X is larger than the
     exact value and zero if X is exact (before the call). It generates
     an underflow or an overflow if the exponent of X is outside the
     current allowed range; the value of T may be used to avoid a
     double rounding. This function returns zero if the rounded result
     is equal to the exact one, a positive value if the rounded result
     is larger than the exact one, a negative value if the rounded
     result is smaller than the exact one. Note that unlike most
     functions, the result is compared to the exact one, not the input
     value X, i.e. the ternary value is propagated.

     Note: If X is an infinity and T is different from zero (i.e., if
     the rounded result is an inexact infinity), then the overflow flag
     is set. This is useful because `mpfr_check_range' is typically
     called (at least in MPFR functions) after restoring the flags that
     could have been set due to internal computations.

 -- Function: int mpfr_subnormalize (mpfr_t X, int T, mp_rnd_t RND)
     This function rounds X emulating subnormal number arithmetic: if X
     is outside the subnormal exponent range, it just propagates the
     ternary value T; otherwise, it rounds X to precision
     `EXP(x)-emin+1' according to rounding mode RND and previous
     ternary value T, avoiding double rounding problems.  More
     precisely in the subnormal domain, denoting by E the value of
     `emin', X is rounded in fixed-point arithmetic to an integer
     multiple of two to the power E-1; as a consequence, 1.5 multiplied
     by two to the power E-1 when T is zero is rounded to two to the
     power E with rounding to nearest.

     `PREC(x)' is not modified by this function.  RND and T must be the
     used rounding mode for computing X and the returned ternary value
     when computing X.  The subnormal exponent range is from `emin' to
     `emin+PREC(x)-1'.  If the result cannot be represented in the
     current exponent range (due to a too small `emax'), the behavior
     is undefined.  Note that unlike most functions, the result is
     compared to the exact one, not the input value X, i.e. the ternary
     value is propagated.  This is a preliminary interface.

   This is an example of how to emulate binary double IEEE 754
arithmetic (binary64 in IEEE 754-2008) using MPFR:

     {
       mpfr_t xa, xb;
       int i;
       volatile double a, b;

       mpfr_set_default_prec (53);
       mpfr_set_emin (-1073);
       mpfr_set_emax (1024);

       mpfr_init (xa); mpfr_init (xb);

       b = 34.3; mpfr_set_d (xb, b, GMP_RNDN);
       a = 0x1.1235P-1021; mpfr_set_d (xa, a, GMP_RNDN);

       a /= b;
       i = mpfr_div (xa, xa, xb, GMP_RNDN);
       i = mpfr_subnormalize (xa, i, GMP_RNDN);

       mpfr_clear (xa); mpfr_clear (xb);
     }

   Warning: this emulates a double IEEE 754 arithmetic with correct
rounding in the subnormal range, which may not be the case for your
hardware.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_underflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_overflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_nanflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_inexflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_erangeflag (void)
     Clear the underflow, overflow, invalid, inexact and _erange_ flags.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_underflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_overflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_nanflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_inexflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_erangeflag (void)
     Set the underflow, overflow, invalid, inexact and _erange_ flags.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_flags (void)
     Clear all global flags (underflow, overflow, inexact, invalid,
     _erange_).

 -- Function: int mpfr_underflow_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_overflow_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_nanflag_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_inexflag_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_erangeflag_p (void)
     Return the corresponding (underflow, overflow, invalid, inexact,
     _erange_) flag, which is non-zero iff the flag is set.

5.14 Compatibility With MPF
===========================

A header file `mpf2mpfr.h' is included in the distribution of MPFR for
compatibility with the GNU MP class MPF.  After inserting the following
two lines after the `#include <gmp.h>' line,
#include <mpfr.h>
#include <mpf2mpfr.h>
 any program written for MPF can be compiled directly with MPFR without
any changes.  All operations are then performed with the default MPFR
rounding mode, which can be reset with `mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode'.

   Warning: the `mpf_init' and `mpf_init2' functions initialize to
zero, whereas the corresponding MPFR functions initialize to NaN: this
is useful to detect uninitialized values, but is slightly incompatible
with `mpf'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_prec_raw (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Reset the precision of X to be *exactly* PREC bits.  The only
     difference with `mpfr_set_prec' is that PREC is assumed to be
     small enough so that the significand fits into the current
     allocated memory space for X. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

 -- Function: int mpfr_eq (mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2, unsigned long int
          OP3)
     Return non-zero if OP1 and OP2 are both non-zero ordinary numbers
     with the same exponent and the same first OP3 bits, both zero, or
     both infinities of the same sign. Return zero otherwise. This
     function is defined for compatibility with `mpf'. Do not use it if
     you want to know whether two numbers are close to each other; for
     instance, 1.011111 and 1.100000 are currently regarded as
     different for any value of OP3 larger than 1 (but this may change
     in the next release).

 -- Function: void mpfr_reldiff (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Compute the relative difference between OP1 and OP2 and store the
     result in ROP.  This function does not guarantee the correct
     rounding on the relative difference; it just computes
     |OP1-OP2|/OP1, using the rounding mode RND for all operations and
     the precision of ROP.

 -- Function: int mpfr_mul_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, unsigned long
          int OP2, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_div_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, unsigned long
          int OP2, mp_rnd_t RND)
     See `mpfr_mul_2ui' and `mpfr_div_2ui'. These functions are only
     kept for compatibility with MPF.


File: mpfr.info,  Node: Custom Interface,  Next: Internals,  Prev: Compatibility with MPF,  Up: MPFR Interface

5.15 Custom Interface
=====================

Some applications use a stack to handle the memory and their objects.
However, the MPFR memory design is not well suited for such a thing. So
that such applications are able to use MPFR, an auxiliary memory
interface has been created: the Custom Interface.

   The following interface allows them to use MPFR in two ways:
   * Either they directly store the MPFR FP number as a `mpfr_t' on the
     stack.

   * Either they store their own representation of a FP number on the
     stack and construct a new temporary `mpfr_t' each time it is
     needed.
   Nothing has to be done to destroy the FP numbers except garbaging
the used memory: all the memory stuff (allocating, destroying,
garbaging) is kept to the application.

   Each function in this interface is also implemented as a macro for
efficiency reasons: for example `mpfr_custom_init (s, p)' uses the
macro, while `(mpfr_custom_init) (s, p)' uses the function.

   Note 1: MPFR functions may still initialize temporary FP numbers
using standard mpfr_init. See Custom Allocation (GNU MP).

   Note 2: MPFR functions may use the cached functions (mpfr_const_pi
for example), even if they are not explicitly called. You have to call
`mpfr_free_cache' each time you garbage the memory iff mpfr_init,
through GMP Custom Allocation, allocates its memory on the application
stack.

   Note 3: This interface is preliminary.

 -- Function: size_t mpfr_custom_get_size (mp_prec_t PREC)
     Return the needed size in bytes to store the significand of a FP
     number of precision PREC.

 -- Function: void mpfr_custom_init (void *SIGNIFICAND, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Initialize a significand of precision PREC.  SIGNIFICAND must be
     an area of `mpfr_custom_get_size (prec)' bytes at least and be
     suitably aligned for an array of `mp_limb_t'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_custom_init_set (mpfr_t X, int KIND, mp_exp_t
          EXP, mp_prec_t PREC, void *SIGNIFICAND)
     Perform a dummy initialization of a `mpfr_t' and set it to:
        * if `ABS(kind) == MPFR_NAN_KIND', X is set to NaN;

        * if `ABS(kind) == MPFR_INF_KIND', X is set to the infinity of
          sign `sign(kind)';

        * if `ABS(kind) == MPFR_ZERO_KIND', X is set to the zero of
          sign `sign(kind)';

        * if `ABS(kind) == MPFR_REGULAR_KIND', X is set to a regular
          number: `x = sign(kind)*significand*2^exp'
     In all cases, it uses SIGNIFICAND directly for further computing
     involving X. It will not allocate anything.  A FP number
     initialized with this function cannot be resized using
     `mpfr_set_prec', or cleared using `mpfr_clear'!  SIGNIFICAND must
     have been initialized with `mpfr_custom_init' using the same
     precision PREC.

 -- Function: int mpfr_custom_get_kind (mpfr_t X)
     Return the current kind of a `mpfr_t' as used by
     `mpfr_custom_init_set'.  The behavior of this function for any
     `mpfr_t' not initialized with `mpfr_custom_init_set' is undefined.

 -- Function: void * mpfr_custom_get_mantissa (mpfr_t X)
     Return a pointer to the significand used by a `mpfr_t' initialized
     with `mpfr_custom_init_set'.  The behavior of this function for
     any `mpfr_t' not initialized with `mpfr_custom_init_set' is
     undefined.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_custom_get_exp (mpfr_t X)
     Return the exponent of X, assuming that X is a non-zero ordinary
     number. The return value for NaN, Infinity or Zero is unspecified
     but does not produce any trap.  The behavior of this function for
     any `mpfr_t' not initialized with `mpfr_custom_init_set' is
     undefined.

 -- Function: void mpfr_custom_move (mpfr_t X, void *NEW_POSITION)
     Inform MPFR that the significand has moved due to a garbage collect
     and update its new position to `new_position'.  However the
     application has to move the significand and the `mpfr_t' itself.
     The behavior of this function for any `mpfr_t' not initialized
     with `mpfr_custom_init_set' is undefined.

   See the test suite for examples.

5.16 Internals
==============

The following types and functions were mainly designed for the
implementation of MPFR, but may be useful for users too.  However no
upward compatibility is guaranteed.  You may need to include
`mpfr-impl.h' to use them.

   The `mpfr_t' type consists of four fields.

   * The `_mpfr_prec' field is used to store the precision of the
     variable (in bits); this is not less than `MPFR_PREC_MIN'.

   * The `_mpfr_sign' field is used to store the sign of the variable.

   * The `_mpfr_exp' field stores the exponent.  An exponent of 0 means
     a radix point just above the most significant limb.  Non-zero
     values n are a multiplier 2^n relative to that point.  A NaN, an
     infinity and a zero are indicated by a special value of the
     exponent.

   * Finally, the `_mpfr_d' is a pointer to the limbs, least
     significant limbs stored first.  The number of limbs in use is
     controlled by `_mpfr_prec', namely
     ceil(`_mpfr_prec'/`mp_bits_per_limb').  Non-singular values always
     have the most significant bit of the most significant limb set to
     1.  When the precision does not correspond to a whole number of
     limbs, the excess bits at the low end of the data are zero.

a first implementation of the sine and cosine, and improved versions of
`mpfr_const_log2' and `mpfr_const_pi'.  Mathieu Dutour contributed the
functions `mpfr_atan' and `mpfr_asin', and a previous version of
`mpfr_gamma'; David Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse
hyperbolic functions, the base-2 exponential, and the factorial
function. Fabrice Rouillier contributed the original version of
`mul_ui.c', the `gmp_op.c' file, and helped to the Microsoft Windows
porting.  Jean-Luc Rémy contributed the `mpfr_zeta' code.  Ludovic
Meunier helped in the design of the `mpfr_erf' code.  Damien Stehlé
contributed the `mpfr_get_ld_2exp' function.

   We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven
for very fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project,
Torbjörn Granlund and Kevin Ryde for their help about design issues,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation.  Kevin Ryde did a tremendous job for the
portability of MPFR in 2002-2004.

   The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible
without the continuous support of INRIA, and of the LORIA (Nancy,
France) and LIP (Lyon, France) laboratories. In particular the main
authors were or are members of the PolKA, Spaces, Cacao project-teams
at LORIA and of the Arenaire project-team at LIP.  This project was
started during the Fiable (reliable in French) action supported by
INRIA, and continued during the AOC action.  The development of MPFR
was also supported by a grant (202F0659 00 MPN 121) from the Conseil
Régional de Lorraine in 2002, and from INRIA by an "associate engineer"
grant (2003-2005) and an "opération de développement logiciel" grant
(2007-2009).

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
