	* chem.pl: Prepare for groff version 1.20.

2008-01-04  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* chem.man: Insert `\:' in URLs where appropriate.

2007-02-06  Eric S. Raymond  <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>

	* chem.man: Change .UR/.UE and .MT/.ME so the start macro no longer
	takes a second argument that is pasted to the end of the generated
	text.  Instead, the end macro takes an argument that does the same
	thing.

	* chem.man: Further refinements and normalizations.

2007-02-02  Eric S. Raymond  <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>

	tmac/TESTING-HINTS.

	### `chem' works now with all example files (examples/*.chem and
	examples/122/*.chem).
	
	* examples/122/README: Add some information on the example files.
	
	* examples/122/chAi_poly_vinyl_chloride.chem: Use .ps with
	argument `-2' and recall `.ps +2' at the end of the file.  This
	stops the size shift in the following files.

	* examples/122/ch6b_dna.chem: Make the file runnable, it works
	now.

	* examples/reserpine.chem: Change access to `begin chem'.

	* chem.man:
	- Fix the BUGS section.
	- Correct the name of the macro file to `macros.pic'.
	- Extent section DESCRIPTION and LANGUAGE.
	- Moieties and Strings: Rewritten section about moieties and
	double quoted strings.

	* chem.pl:
	- parameter check: Add filespecs only when non-empty file.
	- Set $Last_Type to $OTHER for the `pic' command.
	- joinring(), label(), labsave(), reduce(): Remove these functions.
	- `[', `]', `{', `}', `define': Make these and the defined
	functions commands for `chem' without using the `pic' word.
	- @Words: Fix it such that all double quoted strings are
	completely in an element.
	- `Last: ': Remove this prefix from all commands that are related
	to `pic'.

	### global variables
	
	* chem.pl:
	- $Line: Add this variable to store the unchanged input line.
	- %Params: Add the variables from setparams() to this hash.
	- %Types: Add BOND, MOL, RING, OTHER from init() to this hash.
	- %Put: Move %put to this.
	- %Dbl: Move %dbl to this.
	- %Labtype: Move %labtype to this.
	- %Aromatic: Move $aromatic to this.
	- %Dc: Move %dc to this.
	- %Nput: Move $nput to this.
	- %Define: New hash for storing the names of the `define'

	* awk version of chem
	chem is a roff preprocessor that generates chemical structure
	diagrams suitable for the pic preprocessor.  The original version
	of chem is an awk script written by Brian Kernighan.  This project
	is a rewrite of chem in Perl.
