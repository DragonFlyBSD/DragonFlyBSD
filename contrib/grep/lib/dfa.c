/* Perform bottom-up analysis on the parse tree, computing various functions.
   Note that at this point, we're pretending constructs like \< are real
   characters rather than constraints on what can follow them.

   Nullable:  A node is nullable if it is at the root of a regexp that can
   match the empty string.
   *  EMPTY leaves are nullable.
   * No other leaf is nullable.
   * A QMARK or STAR node is nullable.
   * A PLUS node is nullable if its argument is nullable.
   * A CAT node is nullable if both its arguments are nullable.
   * An OR node is nullable if either argument is nullable.

   Firstpos:  The firstpos of a node is the set of positions (nonempty leaves)
   that could correspond to the first character of a string matching the
   regexp rooted at the given node.
   * EMPTY leaves have empty firstpos.
   * The firstpos of a nonempty leaf is that leaf itself.
   * The firstpos of a QMARK, STAR, or PLUS node is the firstpos of its
     argument.
   * The firstpos of a CAT node is the firstpos of the left argument, union
     the firstpos of the right if the left argument is nullable.
   * The firstpos of an OR node is the union of firstpos of each argument.

   Lastpos:  The lastpos of a node is the set of positions that could
   correspond to the last character of a string matching the regexp at
   the given node.
   * EMPTY leaves have empty lastpos.
   * The lastpos of a nonempty leaf is that leaf itself.
   * The lastpos of a QMARK, STAR, or PLUS node is the lastpos of its
     argument.
   * The lastpos of a CAT node is the lastpos of its right argument, union
     the lastpos of the left if the right argument is nullable.
   * The lastpos of an OR node is the union of the lastpos of each argument.

   Follow:  The follow of a position is the set of positions that could
   correspond to the character following a character matching the node in
   a string matching the regexp.  At this point we consider special symbols
   that match the empty string in some context to be just normal characters.
   Later, if we find that a special symbol is in a follow set, we will
   replace it with the elements of its follow, labeled with an appropriate
   constraint.
   * Every node in the firstpos of the argument of a STAR or PLUS node is in
     the follow of every node in the lastpos.
   * Every node in the firstpos of the second argument of a CAT node is in
     the follow of every node in the lastpos of the first argument.

   Because of the postfix representation of the parse tree, the depth-first
   analysis is conveniently done by a linear scan with the aid of a stack.
   Sets are stored as arrays of the elements, obeying a stack-like allocation
   scheme; the number of elements in each set deeper in the stack can be
   used to determine the address of a particular set's array.  */

/*
   Calculate the transition table for a new state derived from state s
   for a compiled dfa d after input character uc, and return the new
   state number.

   Do not worry about all possible input characters; calculate just the group
   of positions that match uc.  Label it with the set of characters that
   every position in the group matches (taking into account, if necessary,
   preceding context information of s).  Then find the union
   of these positions' follows, i.e., the set of positions of the
   new state.  For each character in the group's label, set the transition
   on this character to be to a state corresponding to the set's positions,
   and its associated backward context information, if necessary.

   When building a searching matcher, include the positions of state
   0 in every state.

   The group is constructed by building an equivalence-class
   partition of the positions of s.

   For each position, find the set of characters C that it matches.  Eliminate
   any characters from C that fail on grounds of backward context.

   Check whether the group's label L has nonempty
   intersection with C.  If L - C is nonempty, create a new group labeled
   L - C and having the same positions as the current group, and set L to
   the intersection of L and C.  Insert the position in the group, set
   C = C - L, and resume scanning.

   If after comparing with every group there are characters remaining in C,
   create a new group labeled with the characters of C and insert this
   position in that group.  */

/* Having found the postfix representation of the regular expression,
   try to find a long sequence of characters that must appear in any line
   containing the r.e.
   Finding a "longest" sequence is beyond the scope here;
   we take an easy way out and hope for the best.
   (Take "(ab|a)b"--please.)

   We do a bottom-up calculation of sequences of characters that must appear
   in matches of r.e.'s represented by trees rooted at the nodes of the postfix
   representation:
        sequences that must appear at the left of the match ("left")
        sequences that must appear at the right of the match ("right")
        lists of sequences that must appear somewhere in the match ("in")
        sequences that must constitute the match ("is")

   When we get to the root of the tree, we use one of the longest of its
   calculated "in" sequences as our answer.

   The sequences calculated for the various types of node (in pseudo ANSI c)
   are shown below.  "p" is the operand of unary operators (and the left-hand
   operand of binary operators); "q" is the right-hand operand of binary
   operators.

   "ZERO" means "a zero-length sequence" below.

        Type	left		right		is		in
        ----	----		-----		--		--
        char c	# c		# c		# c		# c

        ANYCHAR	ZERO		ZERO		ZERO		ZERO

        MBCSET	ZERO		ZERO		ZERO		ZERO

        CSET	ZERO		ZERO		ZERO		ZERO

        STAR	ZERO		ZERO		ZERO		ZERO

        QMARK	ZERO		ZERO		ZERO		ZERO

        PLUS	p->left		p->right	ZERO		p->in

        CAT	(p->is==ZERO)?	(q->is==ZERO)?	(p->is!=ZERO &&	p->in plus
                p->left :	q->right :	q->is!=ZERO) ?	q->in plus
                p->is##q->left	p->right##q->is	p->is##q->is : p->right##q->left
                                                ZERO

        OR	longest common	longest common	(do p->is and substrings common
                leading		trailing	to q->is have same p->in and
                (sub)sequence	(sub)sequence	q->in length and content) ?
                of p->left	of p->right
                and q->left	and q->right	p->is : NULL

   If there's anything else we recognize in the tree, all four sequences get set
   to zero-length sequences.  If there's something we don't recognize in the
   tree, we just return a zero-length sequence.

   Break ties in favor of infrequent letters (choosing 'zzz' in preference to
   'aaa')?

   And ... is it here or someplace that we might ponder "optimizations" such as
        egrep 'psi|epsilon'	->	egrep 'psi'
        egrep 'pepsi|epsilon'	->	egrep 'epsi'
                                        (Yes, we now find "epsi" as a "string
                                        that must occur", but we might also
                                        simplify the *entire* r.e. being sought)
        grep '[c]'		->	grep 'c'
        grep '(ab|a)b'		->	grep 'ab'
        grep 'ab*'		->	grep 'a'
        grep 'a*b'		->	grep 'b'

   There are several issues:

   Is optimization easy (enough)?

   Does optimization actually accomplish anything,
   or is the automaton you get from "psi|epsilon" (for example)
   the same as the one you get from "psi" (for example)?

   Are optimizable r.e.'s likely to be used in real-life situations
   (something like 'ab*' is probably unlikely; something like is
   'psi|epsilon' is likelier)?  */
