<chapter id="pccard">
  <title>PC Card</title>

  <para>This chapter will talk about the FreeBSD mechanisms for
    writing a device driver for a PC Card or CardBus device.  However,
    at the present time, it just documents how to add a driver to an
    existing pccard driver.</para>

  <sect1 id="pccard-adddev">
    <title>Adding a device</title>

    <para>The procedure for adding a new device to the list of
      supported pccard devices has changed from the system used
      through FreeBSD 4.  In prior versions, editing a file in
      <filename>/etc</filename> to list the device was necessary.
      Starting in FreeBSD 5.0, devices drivers know what devices they
      support.  There is now a table of supported devices in the
      kernel that drivers use to attach to a device.</para>

    <sect2 id="pccard-overview">
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>PC Cards are identified in one of two ways, both based on
        information in the <acronym>CIS</acronym> of the card.  The
        first method is to use numeric manufacturer and product
        numbers.  The second method is to use the human readable
        strings that are also contained in the CIS.  The PC Card bus
        uses a centralized database and some macros to facilitate a
        design pattern to help the driver writer match devices to his
        driver.</para>

      <para>There is a widespread practice of one company developing a
        reference design for a PC Card product and then selling this
        design to other companies to market.  Those companies refine
        the design, market the product to their target audience or
        geographic area and put their own name plate onto the card.
        However, the refinements to the physical card typically are
        very minor, if any changes are made at all.  Often, however,
        to strengthen their branding of their version of the card,
        these vendors will place their company name in the human
        strings in the CIS space, but leave the manufacturer and
        product ids unchanged.</para>

      <para>Because of the above practice, it is a smaller work load
        for FreeBSD to use the numeric IDs.  It also introduces some
        minor complications into the process of adding IDs to the
        system.  One must carefully check to see who really made the
        card, especially when it appears that the vendor who made the
        card from might already have a different manufacturer id
        listed in the central database.  Linksys, D-Link and NetGear
        are a number of US Manufacturers of LAN hardware that often
        sell the same design.  These same designs can be sold in Japan
        under names such as Buffalo and Corega.  Yet often, these
        devices will all have the same manufacturer and product
        id.</para>

      <para>The PC Card bus keeps its central database of card
        information, but not which driver is associated with them, in
        <filename>/sys/dev/pccard/pccarddevs</filename>.  It also
        provides a set of macros that allow one to easily construct
        simple entries in the table the driver uses to claim
        devices.</para>

      <para>Finally, some really low end devices do not contain
        manufacturer identification at all.  These devices require
        that one matches them using the human readable CIS strings.
        While it would be nice if we didn't need this method as a
        fallback, it is necessary for some very low end CD-ROM players
        that are quite popular.  This method should generally be
        avoided, but a number of devices are listed in this section
        because they were added prior to the recognition of the
        <acronym>OEM</acronym> nature of the PC Card business.  When
        adding new devices, prefer using the numeric method.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="pccard-pccarddevs">
      <title>Format of <filename>pccarddevs</filename></title>

      <para>There are four sections of the
        <filename>pccarddevs</filename> files.  The first section
        lists the manufacturer numbers for those vendors that use
        them.  This section is sorted in numerical order.  The next
        section has all of the products that are used by these
        vendors, along with their product ID numbers and a description
        string.  The description string typically isn't used (instead
        we set the device's description based on the human readable
        CIS, even if we match on the numeric version).  These two
        sections are then repeated for those devices that use the
        string matching method.  Finally, C-style comments are allowed
        anywhere in the file.</para>

      <para>The first section of the file contains the vendor IDs.
        Please keep this list sorted in numeric order.  Also, please
        coordinate changes to this file because we share it with
        NetBSD to help facilitate a common clearing house for this
        information.  For example:</para>

<programlisting>vendor FUJITSU			0x0004  Fujitsu Corporation
vendor NETGEAR_2		0x000b  Netgear
vendor PANASONIC		0x0032	Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
vendor SANDISK			0x0045	Sandisk Corporation</programlisting>

      <para>shows the first few vendor ids.  Chances are very good
        that the <literal>NETGEAR_2</literal> entry is really an OEM
        that NETGEAR purchased cards from and the author of support
        for those cards was unaware at the time that Netgear was using
        someone else's id.  These entries are fairly straightforward.
        There's the vendor keyword used to denote the kind of line
        that this is.  There's the name of the vendor.  This name will
        be repeated later in the pccarddevs file, as well as used in
        the driver's match tables, so keep it short and a valid C
        identifier.  There's a numeric ID, in hex, for the
        manufacturer.  Do not add IDs of the form
        <literal>0xffffffff</literal> or <literal>0xffff</literal>
        because these are reserved ids (the former is 'no id set'
        while the latter is sometimes seen in extremely poor quality
        cards to try to indicate 'none).  Finally there's a string
        description of the company that makes the card.  This string
        is not used in FreeBSD for anything but commentary
        purposes.</para>

      <para>The second section of the file contains the products.  As
        you can see in the following example:</para>

<programlisting>/* Allied Telesis K.K. */
product ALLIEDTELESIS LA_PCM	0x0002 Allied Telesis LA-PCM

/* Archos */
product	ARCHOS ARC_ATAPI	0x0043 MiniCD</programlisting>

      <para>the format is similar to the vendor lines.  There is the
        product keyword.  Then there is the vendor name, repeated from
        above.  This is followed by the product name, which is used by
        the driver and should be a valid C identifier, but may also
        start with a number.  There's then the product id for this
        card, in hex.  As with the vendors, there's the same
        convention for <literal>0xffffffff</literal> and
        <literal>0xffff</literal>.  Finally, there's a string
        description of the device itself.  This string typically is
        not used in FreeBSD, since FreeBSD's pccard bus driver will
        construct a string from the human readable CIS entries, but it
        can be used in the rare cases where this is somehow
        insufficient.  The products are in alphabetical order by
        manufacturer, then numerical order by product id.  They have a
        C comment before each manufacturer's entries and there is a
        blank line between entries.</para>

      <para>The third section is like the previous vendor section, but
        with all of the manufacturer numeric ids as
        <literal>-1</literal>.  <literal>-1</literal> means
        <quote>match anything you find</quote> in the FreeBSD pccard
        bus code.  Since these are C identifiers, their names must be
        unique.  Otherwise the format is identical to the first
        section of the file.</para>

      <para>The final section contains the entries for those cards
        that we must match with string entries.  This sections' format
        is a little different than the generic section:</para>

<programlisting>product ADDTRON AWP100		{ "Addtron", "AWP-100&amp;spWireless&amp;spPCMCIA", "Version&amp;sp01.02", NULL }
product ALLIEDTELESIS WR211PCM	{ "Allied&amp;spTelesis&amp;spK.K.", "WR211PCM", NULL, NULL } Allied Telesis WR211PCM</programlisting>

      <para>We have the familiar product keyword, followed by the
        vendor name followed by the card name, just as in the second
        section of the file.  However, then we deviate from that
        format.  There is a {} grouping, followed by a number of
        strings.  These strings correspond to the vendor, product and
        extra information that is defined in a CIS_INFO tuple.  These
        strings are filtered by the program that generates
        <filename>pccarddevs.h</filename> to replace &amp;sp with a
        real space.  NULL entries mean that that part of the entry
        should be ignored.  In the example I've picked, there's a bad
        entry.  It shouldn't contain the version number in it unless
        that's critical for the operation of the card.  Sometimes
        vendors will have many different versions of the card in the
        field that all work, in which case that information only makes
        it harder for someone with a similar card to use it with
        FreeBSD.  Sometimes it is necessary when a vendor wishes to
        sell many different parts under the same brand due to market
        considerations (availability, price, and so forth).  Then it
        can be critical to disambiguating the card in those rare cases
        where the vendor kept the same manufacturer/product pair.
        Regular expression matching is not available at this
        time.</para>

    <sect2 id="pccard-probe">
      <title>Sample probe routine</title>

      <para>To understand how to add a device to the list of supported
        devices, one must understand the probe and/or match routines
        that many drivers have.  It is complicated a little in FreeBSD
        5.x because there is a compatibility layer for OLDCARD present
        as well.  Since only the window-dressing is different, an
        idealized version will be presented here.</para>

<programlisting>static const struct pccard_product wi_pccard_products[] = {
	PCMCIA_CARD(3COM, 3CRWE737A, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(BUFFALO, WLI_PCM_S11, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(BUFFALO, WLI_CF_S11G, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(TDK, LAK_CD011WL, 0),
	{ NULL }
};

static int
wi_pccard_probe(dev)
	device_t	dev;
{
	const struct pccard_product *pp;

	if ((pp = pccard_product_lookup(dev, wi_pccard_products,
	    sizeof(wi_pccard_products[0]), NULL)) != NULL) {
		if (pp->pp_name != NULL)
			device_set_desc(dev, pp->pp_name);
		return (0);
	}
	return (ENXIO);
}</programlisting>

      <para>Here we have a simple pccard probe routine that matches a
        few devices.  As stated above, the name may vary (if it isn't
        <function>foo_pccard_probe()</function> it will be
        <function>foo_pccard_match()</function>).  The function
        <function>pccard_product_lookup()</function> is a generalized
        function that walks the table and returns a pointer to the
        first entry that it matches.  Some drivers may use this
        mechanism to convey additional information about some cards to
        the rest of the driver, so there may be some variance in the
        table.  The only requirement is that if you have a different
        table, the first element of the structure you have a table of
        be a struct pccard_product.</para>

      <para>Looking at the table
        <structname>wi_pccard_products</structname>, one notices that
        all the entries are of the form
        <function>PCMCIA_CARD(<replaceable>foo</replaceable>,
        <replaceable>bar</replaceable>,
        <replaceable>baz</replaceable>)</function>.  The
        <replaceable>foo</replaceable> part is the manufacturer id
        from <filename>pccarddevs</filename>.  The
        <replaceable>bar</replaceable> part is the product.  The
        <replaceable>baz</replaceable> is the expected function number
        that for this card.  Many pccards can have multiple functions,
        and some way to disambiguate function 1 from function 0 is
        needed.  You may see <literal>PCMCIA_CARD_D</literal>, which
        includes the device description from the
        <filename>pccarddevs</filename> file.  You may also see
        <literal>PCMCIA_CARD2</literal> and
        <literal>PCMCIA_CARD2_D</literal> which are used when you need
        to match CIS both CIS strings and manufacturer numbers, in the
        <quote>use the default description</quote> and <quote>take the
        description from pccarddevs</quote> flavors.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="pccard-add">
      <title>Putting it all together</title>

      <para>So, to add a new device, one must do the following steps.
        First, one must obtain the identification information from the
        device.  The easiest way to do this is to insert the device
        into a PC Card or CF slot and issue <command>devinfo
        -v</command>.  You'll likely see something like:</para>

<programlisting>        cbb1 pnpinfo vendor=0x104c device=0xac51 subvendor=0x1265 subdevice=0x0300 class=0x060700 at slot=10 function=1
          cardbus1
          pccard1
            unknown pnpinfo manufacturer=0x026f product=0x030c cisvendor="BUFFALO" cisproduct="WLI2-CF-S11" function_type=6 at function=0</programlisting>

      <para>as part of the output.  The manufacturer and product are
        the numeric IDs for this product.  While the cisvendor and
        cisproduct are the strings that are present in the CIS that
        describe this product.</para>

      <para>Since we first want to prefer the numeric option, first
        try to construct an entry based on that.  The above card has
        been slightly fictionalized for the purpose of this example.
        The vendor is BUFFALO, which we see already has an
        entry:</para>

<programlisting>vendor BUFFALO			0x026f	BUFFALO (Melco Corporation)</programlisting>

      <para>so we're good there.  Looking for an entry for this card,
        we do not find one.  Instead we find:</para>

<programlisting>/* BUFFALO */
product BUFFALO WLI_PCM_S11	0x0305	BUFFALO AirStation 11Mbps WLAN
product BUFFALO LPC_CF_CLT	0x0307	BUFFALO LPC-CF-CLT
product	BUFFALO	LPC3_CLT	0x030a	BUFFALO LPC3-CLT Ethernet Adapter
product BUFFALO WLI_CF_S11G	0x030b	BUFFALO AirStation 11Mbps CF WLAN</programlisting>

      <para>we can just add</para>

<programlisting>product BUFFALO WLI2_CF_S11G	0x030c	BUFFALO AirStation ultra 802.11b CF</programlisting>

      <para>to <filename>pccarddevs</filename>.  Presently, there is a
        manual step to regenerate the
        <filename>pccarddevs.h</filename> file used to convey these
        identifiers to the the client driver.  The following steps
        must be done before you can use them in the driver:</para>

<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd src/sys/dev/pccard</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make -f Makefile.pccarddevs</userinput>
</screen>

      <para>Once these steps are complete, you can add the card to the
        driver.  That is a simple operation of adding one line:</para>

<programlisting>static const struct pccard_product wi_pccard_products[] = {
	PCMCIA_CARD(3COM, 3CRWE737A, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(BUFFALO, WLI_PCM_S11, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(BUFFALO, WLI_CF_S11G, 0),
+	PCMCIA_CARD(BUFFALO, WLI_CF2_S11G, 0),
	PCMCIA_CARD(TDK, LAK_CD011WL, 0),
	{ NULL }
};</programlisting>

      <para>Note that I've included a '<literal>+</literal>' in the
        line before the line that I added, but that is simply to
        highlight the line.  Do not add it to the actual driver.  Once
        you've added the line, you can recompile your kernel or module
        and try to see if it recognizes the device.  If it does and
        works, please submit a patch.  If it doesn't work, please
        figure out what is needed to make it work and submit a patch.
        If it didn't recognize it at all, you have done something
        wrong and should recheck each step.</para>

      <para>If you are a FreeBSD src committer, and everything appears
        to be working, then you can commit the changes to the tree.
        However, there are some minor tricky things that you need to
        worry about.  First, you must commit the
        <filename>pccarddevs</filename> file to the tree.  After you
        have done that, you must regenerate
        <filename>pccarddevs.h</filename> and commit it as a second
        commit (this is to make sure that the right
        &dollar;FreeBSD&dollar; tag is in the latter file).  Finally,
        you need to commit the additions to the driver.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="pccard-pr">
      <title>Submitting a new device</title>

      <para>Many people send entries for new devices to the author
        directly.  Please do not do this.  Please submit them as a PR
        and send the author the PR number for his records.  This makes
        sure that entries aren't lost.  When submitting a PR, it is
        unnecessary to include the <filename>pccardevs.h</filename>
        diffs in the patch, since those will be regenerated.  It is
        necessary to include a description of the device, as well as
        the patches to the client driver.  If you don't know the name,
        use OEM99 as the name, and the author will adjust OEM99
        accordingly after investigation.  Committers should not commit
        OEM99, but instead find the highest OEM entry and commit one
        more than that.</para>
