    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a new way of attaching
      devices to personal computers. The bus architecture features
      two-way communication and has been developed as a response to
      devices becoming smarter and requiring more interaction with the
      host.  USB support is included in all current PC chipsets and is
      therefore available in all recently built PCs.  Apple's
      introduction of the USB-only iMac has been a major incentive for
      hardware manufacturers to produce USB versions of their devices.
      The future PC specifications specify that all legacy connectors
      on PCs should be replaced by one or more USB connectors,
      providing generic plug and play capabilities.  Support for USB
      hardware was available at a very early stage in NetBSD and was
      developed by Lennart Augustsson for the NetBSD project.  The
      code has been ported to FreeBSD and we are currently maintaining
      a shared code base.  For the implementation of the USB subsystem
      a number of features of USB are important.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Lennart Augustsson has done most of the implementation of
      the USB support for the NetBSD project. Many thanks for this
      incredible amount of work. Many thanks also to Ardy and Dirk for
      their comments and proofreading of this paper.</emphasis></para>

    <para>The development of drivers for the USB subsystem and devices
      connected to it is supported by the specifications that have
      been developed and will be developed. These specifications are
      publicly available from the USB home pages.  Apple has been very
      strong in pushing for standards based drivers, by making drivers
      for the generic classes available in their operating system
      MacOS and discouraging the use of separate drivers for each new
      device.  This chapter tries to collate essential information for a
      basic understanding of the present implementation of the USB
      stack in FreeBSD/NetBSD.  It is recommended however to read it
      together with the relevant specifications mentioned in the
      references below.</para>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Structure of the USB Stack</title>

      <para>The USB support in FreeBSD can be split into three
        layers. The lowest layer contains the host controller driver,
        providing a generic interface to the hardware and its scheduling
        facilities.  It supports initialisation of the hardware,
        scheduling of transfers and handling of completed and/or failed
        transfers.  Each host controller driver implements a virtual hub
        providing hardware independent access to the registers
        controlling the root ports on the back of the machine.</para>

      <para>The middle layer handles the device connection and
        disconnection, basic initialisation of the device, driver
        selection, the communication channels (pipes) and does
        resource management.  This services layer also controls the
        default pipes and the device requests transferred over
        them.</para>
  
      <para>The top layer contains the individual drivers supporting
        specific (classes of) devices. These drivers implement the
        protocol that is used over the pipes other than the default
        pipe. They also implement additional functionality to make the
        device available to other parts of the kernel or userland. They
        use the USB driver interface (USBDI) exposed by the services
        layer.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="usb-hc">
    <title>Host Controllers</title>

    <para>The host controller (HC) controls the transmission of
      packets on the bus. Frames of 1 millisecond are used. At the
      start of each frame the host controller generates a Start of
      Frame (SOF) packet.</para>

    <para>The SOF packet is used to synchronise to the start of the
      frame and to keep track of the frame number. Within each frame
      packets are transferred, either from host to device (out) or
      from device to host (in). Transfers are always initiated by the
      host (polled transfers). Therefore there can only be one host
      per USB bus. Each transfer of a packet has a status stage in
      which the recipient of the data can return either ACK
      (acknowledge reception), NAK (retry), STALL (error condition) or
      nothing (garbled data stage, device not available or
      disconnected). Section 8.5 of the <ulink
      url="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs.html">USB
      specification</ulink> explains the details of packets in more
      detail. Four different types of transfers can occur on a USB
      bus: control, bulk, interrupt and isochronous.  The types of
      transfers and their characteristics are described below (`Pipes'
      subsection).</para>

    <para>Large transfers between the device on the USB bus and the
      device driver are split up into multiple packets by the host
      controller or the HC driver.</para>

    <para>Device requests (control transfers) to the default endpoints
      are special. They consist of two or three phases: SETUP, DATA
      (optional) and STATUS. The set-up packet is sent to the
      device. If there is a data phase, the direction of the data
      packet(s) is given in the set-up packet. The direction in the
      status phase is the opposite of the direction during the data
      phase, or IN if there was no data phase. The host controller
      hardware also provides registers with the current status of the
      root ports and the changes that have occurred since the last
      reset of the status change register. Access to these registers
      is provided through a virtualised hub as suggested in the USB
      specification [ 2]. The virtual hub must comply with the hub
      device class given in chapter 11 of that specification. It must
      provide a default pipe through which device requests can be sent
      to it. It returns the standard andhub class specific set of
      descriptors. It should also provide an interrupt pipe that
      reports changes happening at its ports. There are currently two
      specifications for host controllers available: <ulink
      url="http://developer.intel.com/design/USB/UHCI11D.htm">Universal
      Host Controller Interface</ulink> (UHCI; Intel) and <ulink
      url="http://www.compaq.com/productinfo/development/openhci.html">Open
      Host Controller Interface</ulink> (OHCI; Compaq, Microsoft,
      National Semiconductor). The UHCI specification has been
      designed to reduce hardware complexity by requiring the host
      controller driver to supply a complete schedule of the transfers
      for each frame. OHCI type controllers are much more independent
      by providing a more abstract interface doing alot of work
      themselves. </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>UHCI</title>

      <para>The UHCI host controller maintains a framelist with 1024
        pointers to per frame data structures. It understands two
        different data types: transfer descriptors (TD) and queue
        heads (QH). Each TD represents a packet to be communicated to
        or from a device endpoint. QHs are a means to groupTDs (and
        QHs) together.</para>

      <para>Each transfer consists of one or more packets. The UHCI
        driver splits large transfers into multiple packets. For every
        transfer, apart from isochronous transfers, a QH is
        allocated. For every type of transfer these QHs are collected
        at a QH for that type. Isochronous transfers have to be
        executed first because of the fixed latency requirement and
        are directly referred to by the pointer in the framelist. The
        last isochronous TD refers to the QH for interrupt transfers
        for that frame. All QHs for interrupt transfers point at the
        QH for control transfers, which in turn points at the QH for
        bulk transfers. The following diagram gives a graphical
        overview of this:</para>

      <para>This results in the following schedule being run in each
        frame. After fetching the pointer for the current frame from
        the framelist the controller first executes the TDs for all
        the isochronous packets in that frame. The last of these TDs
        refers to the QH for the interrupt transfers for
        thatframe. The host controller will then descend from that QH
        to the QHs for the individual interrupt transfers. After
        finishing that queue, the QH for the interrupt transfers will
        refer the controller to the QH for all control transfers. It
        will execute all the subqueues scheduled there, followed by
        all the transfers queued at the bulk QH. To facilitate the
        handling of finished or failed transfers different types of
        interrupts are generated by the hardware at the end of each
        frame. In the last TD for a transfer the Interrupt-On
        Completion bit is set by the HC driver to flag an interrupt
        when the transfer has completed. An error interrupt is flagged
        if a TD reaches its maximum error count. If the short packet
        detect bit is set in a TD and less than the set packet length
        is transferred this interrupt is flagged to notify
        the controller driver of the completed transfer. It is the host
        controller driver's task to find out which transfer has
        completed or produced an error. When called the interrupt
        service routine will locate all the finished transfers and
        call their callbacks.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>OHCI</title>
      
      <para>Programming an OHCI host controller is much simpler. The
        controller assumes that a set of endpoints is available, and
        is aware of scheduling priorities and the ordering of the
        types of transfers in a frame. The main data structure used by
        the host controller is the endpoint descriptor (ED) to which
        aqueue of transfer descriptors (TDs) is attached. The ED
        contains the maximum packet size allowed for an endpoint and
        the controller hardware does the splitting into packets. The
        pointers to the data buffers are updated after each transfer
        and when the start and end pointer are equal, the TD is
        retired to the done-queue. The four types of endpoints have
        their own queues. Control and bulk endpoints are queued each at
        their own queue. Interrupt EDs are queued in a tree, with the
        level in the tree defining the frequency at which they
        run.</para>

      <para>framelist interruptisochronous control bulk</para>

      <para>The schedule being run by the host controller in each
        frame looks as follows. The controller will first run the
        non-periodic control and bulk queues, up to a time limit set
        by the HC driver. Then the interrupt transfers for that frame
        number are run, by using the lower five bits of the frame
        number as an index into level 0 of the tree of interrupts
        EDs. At the end of this tree the isochronous EDs are connected
        and these are traversed subsequently. The isochronous TDs
        contain the frame number of the first frame the transfer
        should be run in. After all the periodic transfers have been
        run, the control and bulk queues are traversed
        again. Periodically the interrupt service routine is called to
        process the done queue and call the callbacks for each
        transfer and reschedule interrupt and isochronous
        endpoints.</para>

        provides access to the device in a controlled way and
        maintains resources in use by the different drivers and the
        services layer. The layer takes care of the following

    <sect2>
      <title>Device configuration information</title>

      <para>Each device provides different levels of configuration
        information. Each device has one or more configurations, of
        which one is selected during probe/attach. A configuration
        provides power and bandwidth requirements. Within each
        configuration there can be multiple interfaces. A device
        interface is a collection of endpoints. For example USB
        speakers can have an interface for the audio data (Audio
        Class) and an interface for the knobs, dials and buttons (HID
        Class). All interfaces in a configuration are active at the
        same time and can be attached to by different drivers. Each
        interface can have alternates, providing different quality of
        service parameters. In for example cameras this is used to
        provide different frame sizes and numbers of frames per
        second.</para>

      <para>Within each interface 0 or more endpoints can be
        specified. Endpoints are the unidirectional access points for
        communicating with a device. They provide buffers to
        temporarily store incoming or outgoing data from the
        device. Each endpoint has a unique address within
        a configuration, the endpoint's number plus its direction. The
        default endpoint, endpoint 0, is not part of any interface and
        available in all configurations. It is managed by the services
        layer and not directly available to device drivers.</para>

      <para>Level 0 Level 1 Level 2 Slot 0</para>
      <para>Slot 3 Slot 2 Slot 1</para>
      <para>(Only 4 out of 32 slots shown)</para>

      <para>This hierarchical configuration information is described
        in the device by a standard set of descriptors (see section 9.6
        of the USB specification [ 2]). They can be requested through
        the Get Descriptor Request. The services layer caches these
        descriptors to avoid unnecessary transfers on the USB
        bus. Access to the descriptors is provided through function
        calls.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Device descriptors: General information about
          the device, like Vendor, Product and Revision Id, supported

  	  languages.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Class specifications can add their own descriptor types
        that are available through the GetDescriptor Request.</para>

      <para>Pipes Communication to end points on a device flows
        through so-called pipes. Drivers submit transfers to endpoints
        to a pipe and provide a callback to be called on completion or
        failure of the transfer (asynchronous transfers) or wait for
        completion (synchronous transfer). Transfers to an endpoint
        are serialised in the pipe. A transfer can either complete,
        fail or time-out (if a time-out has been set). There are two
        types of time-outs for transfers. Time-outs can happen due to
        time-out on the USBbus (milliseconds). These time-outs are
        seen as failures and can be due to disconnection of the
        device. A second form of time-out is implemented in software
        and is triggered when a transfer does not complete within a
        specified amount of time (seconds). These are caused by a
        device acknowledging negatively (NAK) the transferred
        packets. The cause for this is the device not being ready to
        receive data, buffer under- or overrun or protocol
        errors.</para>

      <para>If a transfer over a pipe is larger than the maximum
        packet size specified in the associated endpoint descriptor,
        the host controller (OHCI) or the HC driver (UHCI) will split
        the transfer into packets of maximum packet size, with the
        last packet possibly smaller than the maximum
        packet size.</para>

      <para>Sometimes it is not a problem for a device to return less
        data than requested. For example abulk-in-transfer to a modem
        might request 200 bytes of data, but the modem has only 5
        bytes available at that time. The driver can set the short
        packet (SPD) flag. It allows the host controller to accept a
        packet even if the amount of data transferred is less than
        requested. This flag is only valid for in-transfers, as the
        amount of data to be sent to a device is always known
        beforehand. If an unrecoverable error occurs in a device
        during a transfer the pipe is stalled. Before any more data is
        accepted or sent the driver needs to resolve the cause of the
        stall and clear the endpoint stall condition through send the
        clear endpoint halt device request over the default
        pipe. The default endpoint should never stall.</para>

      <para>There are four different types of endpoints and
        corresponding pipes: - Control pipe / default pipe: There is
        one control pipe per device, connected to the default endpoint
        (endpoint 0). The pipe carries the device requests and
        associated data. The difference between transfers over the
        default pipe and other pipes is that the protocol for
        the transfers is described in the USB specification [ 2]. These
        requests are used to reset and configure the device. A basic
        set of commands that must be supported by each device is
        provided in chapter 9 of the USB specification [ 2]. The
        commands supported on this pipe can be extended by a device
        class specification to support additional
        functionality.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Bulk pipe: This is the USB equivalent to a raw
          transmission medium.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Interrupt pipe: The host sends a request for
          data to the device and if the device has nothing to send, it
          will NAK the data packet. Interrupt transfers are scheduled
          at a frequency specified when creating the
          pipe.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Isochronous pipe: These pipes are intended for
	    isochronous data, for example video or audio streams, with
	fixed latency, but no guaranteed delivery. Some support for
	pipes of this type is available in the current
	implementation. Packets in control, bulk and interrupt
	transfers are retried if an error occurs during transmission
	or the device acknowledges the packet negatively (NAK) due to
	for example lack of buffer space to store the incoming
	data. Isochronous packets are however not retried in case of
	failed delivery or NAK of a packet as this might violate the
	timing constraints.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The availability of the necessary bandwidth is calculated
        during the creation of the pipe. Transfers are scheduled within
        frames of 1 millisecond. The bandwidth allocation within a
        frame is prescribed by the USB specification, section 5.6 [
        2]. Isochronous and interrupt transfers are allowed to consume
        up to 90% of the bandwidth within a frame. Packets for control
        and bulk transfers are scheduled after all isochronous and
        interrupt packets and will consume all the remaining
        bandwidth.</para>

      <para>More information on scheduling of transfers and bandwidth
        reclamation can be found in chapter 5of the USB specification
        [ 2], section 1.3 of the UHCI specification [ 3] and section
        3.4.2 of the OHCI specification [4].</para>

    <title>Device probe and attach</title>

    <para>After the notification by the hub that a new device has been
      connected, the service layer switches on the port, providing the
      device with 100 mA of current. At this point the device is in
      its default state and listening to device address 0. The
      services layer will proceed to retrieve the various descriptors
      through the default pipe. After that it will send a Set Address
      request to move the device away from the default device address
      (address 0). Multiple device drivers might be able to support
      the device. For example a modem driver might be able to support
      an ISDN TA through the AT compatibility interface. A driver for
      that specific model of the ISDN adapter might however be able to
      provide much better support for this device. To support this
      flexibility, the probes return priorities indicating their level
      of support. Support for a specific revision of a product ranks
      the highest and the generic driver the lowest priority. It might
      also be that multiple drivers could attach to one device if
      there are multiple interfaces within one configuration. Each
      driver only needs to support a subset of the interfaces.</para>

    <para>The probing for a driver for a newly attached device checks
      first for device specific drivers. If not found, the probe code
      iterates over all supported configurations until a driver
      attaches in a configuration. To support devices with multiple
      drivers on different interfaces, the probe iterates over all
      interfaces in a configuration that have not yet been claimed by
      a driver. Configurations that exceed the power budget for the
      hub are ignored. During attach the driver should initialise the
      device to its proper state, but not reset it, as this will make
      the device disconnect itself from the bus and restart the
      probing process for it. To avoid consuming unnecessary bandwidth
      should not claim the interrupt pipe at attach time, but
      should postpone allocating the pipe until the file is opened and
      the data is actually used. When the file is closed the pipe
      should be closed again, even though the device might still be
      attached.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Device disconnect and detach</title>

      <para>A device driver should expect to receive errors during any
        transaction with the device. The design of USB supports and
        encourages the disconnection of devices at any point in
        time. Drivers should make sure that they do the right thing
        when the device disappears.</para>

      <para>Furthermore a device that has been disconnected and
        reconnected will not be reattached at the same device
        instance. This might change in the future when more devices
        support serial numbers (see the device descriptor) or other
        means of defining an identity for a device have been
        developed.</para>

      <para>The disconnection of a device is signaled by a hub in the
        interrupt packet delivered to the hub driver. The status
        change information indicates which port has seen a connection
        change. The device detach method for all device drivers for
        the device connected on that port are called and the structures
        cleaned up. If the port status indicates that in the mean time
        a device has been connected to that port, the procedure for
        probing and attaching the device will be started. A device
        reset will produce a disconnect-connect sequence on the hub
        and will be handled as described above.</para>

    <title>USB Drivers Protocol Information</title>

    <para>The protocol used over pipes other than the default pipe is
      undefined by the USB specification.  Information on this can be
      found from various sources. The most accurate source is the
      developer's section on the USB home pages [ 1]. From these pages
      a growing number of deviceclass specifications are
      available. These specifications specify what a compliant device
      should look like from a driver perspective, basic functionality
      it needs to provide and the protocol that is to be used over the
      communication channels.  The USB specification [ 2] includes the
      description of the Hub Class. A class specification for Human
      Interface Devices (HID) has been created to cater for keyboards,
      tablets, bar-code readers, buttons, knobs, switches, etc. A
      third example is the class specification for mass storage
      devices. For a full list of device classes see the developers
      section on the USB home pages [ 1].</para>

    <para>For many devices the protocol information has not yet been
      published however. Information on the protocol being used might
      be available from the company making the device. Some companies
      will require you to sign a Non -Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
      before giving you the specifications. This in most cases
      precludes making the driver open source.</para>

    <para>Another good source of information is the Linux driver
      sources, as a number of companies have started to provide drivers
      for Linux for their devices. It is always a good idea to contact
      the authors of those drivers for their source of
      information.</para>

    <para>Example: Human Interface Devices The specification for the
      Human Interface Devices like keyboards, mice, tablets, buttons,
      dials,etc. is referred to in other device class specifications
      and is used in many devices.</para>

    <para>For example audio speakers provide endpoints to the digital
      to analogue converters and possibly an extra pipe for a
      microphone. They also provide a HID endpoint in a separate
      interface for the buttons and dials on the front of the
      device. The same is true for the monitor control class. It is
      straightforward to build support for these interfaces through
      the available kernel and userland libraries together with the
      HID class driver or the generic driver. Another device that
      serves as an example for interfaces within one configuration
      driven by different device drivers is a cheap keyboard with
      built-in legacy mouse port. To avoid having the cost of
      including the hardware for a USB hub in the device,
      manufacturers combined the mouse data received from the PS/2 port
      on the back of the keyboard and the key presses from the keyboard
      into two separate interfaces in the same configuration. The
      mouse and keyboard drivers each attach to the appropriate
      interface and allocate the pipes to the two independent
      endpoints.</para>

    <para>Example: Firmware download Many devices that have been
      developed are based on a general purpose processor with
      an additional USB core added to it. Because the development of
      drivers and firmware for USB devices is still very new, many
      devices require the downloading of the firmware after they
      have been connected.</para>

    <para>The procedure followed is straightforward. The device
      identifies itself through a vendor and product Id. The first
      driver probes and attaches to it and downloads the firmware into
      it. After that the device soft resets itself and the driver is
      detached. After a short pause the device announces its presence
      on the bus. The device will have changed its
      vendor/product/revision Id to reflect the fact that it has been
      supplied with firmware and as a consequence a second driver will
      probe it and attach to it.</para>

    <para>An example of these types of devices is the ActiveWire I/O
      board, based on the EZ-USB chip. For this chip a generic firmware
      downloader is available. The firmware downloaded into the
      ActiveWire board changes the revision Id. It will then perform a
      soft reset of the USB part of the EZ-USB chip to disconnect from
      the USB bus and again reconnect.</para>

    <para>Example: Mass Storage Devices Support for mass storage
      devices is mainly built around existing protocols. The Iomega
      USB Zipdrive is based on the SCSI version of their drive. The
      SCSI commands and status messages are wrapped in blocks and
      transferred over the bulk pipes to and from the device,
      emulating a SCSI controller over the USB wire. ATAPI and UFI
      commands are supported in a similar fashion.</para>

    <para>The Mass Storage Specification supports 2 different types of
      wrapping of the command block.The initial attempt was based on
      sending the command and status through the default pipe and
      using bulk transfers for the data to be moved between the host
      and the device. Based on experience a second approach was
      designed that was based on wrapping the command and status
      blocks and sending them over the bulk out and in endpoint. The
      specification specifies exactly what has to happen when and what
      has to be done in case an error condition is encountered. The
      biggest challenge when writing drivers for these devices is to
      fit USB based protocol into the existing support for mass storage
      devices. CAM provides hooks to do this in a fairly straight
      forward way. ATAPI is less simple as historically the IDE
      interface has never had many different appearances.</para>

    <para>The support for the USB floppy from Y-E Data is again less
      straightforward as a new command set has been designed.</para>
