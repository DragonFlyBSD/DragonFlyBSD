    <para>FreeBSD can be used to print to a wide variety of printers, from the
      oldest impact printer to the latest laser printers, and everything in
      between, allowing you to produce high quality printed output from the
      applications you run.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD can also be configured to act as a print server on a
      network; in this capacity FreeBSD can receive print jobs from a variety
      of other computers, including other FreeBSD computers, &windows; and &macos;
      hosts.  FreeBSD will ensure that one job at a time is printed, and can
      keep statistics on which users and machines are doing the most printing,
      produce <quote>banner</quote> pages showing who's printout is who's, and
      more.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>In order to use printers with FreeBSD, you will need to set
      them up to work with the Berkeley line printer spooling system,
      also known as the <application>LPD</application> spooling system.
      It is the standard printer control system in FreeBSD.  This
      chapter introduces the <application>LPD</application> spooling
      system, often simply called <application>LPD</application>, and
      will guide you through its configuration.</para>

    <para>If you are already familiar with 
      <application>LPD</application> or another printer spooling
      system, you may wish to skip to section <link

      system</link>.</para>

    <para><application>LPD</application> controls everything about a 
      host's printers.  It is responsible for a number of things:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>It controls access to attached printers and printers
	  attached to other hosts on the network.</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>Through a configuration file

    <sect2 id="printing-intro-why">
      <title>Why You Should Use the Spooler</title>

      <para>If you are the sole user of your system, you may be wondering
        why you should bother with the spooler when you do not need access
	control, header pages, or printer accounting.  While it is
	possible to enable direct access to a printer, you should use the
	spooler anyway since:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><application>LPD</application> prints jobs in the background;
	    you do not have to wait
	    for data to be copied to the printer.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>&tex;</primary></indexterm>
	<listitem>
	  <para><application>LPD</application> can conveniently run a job

	    understand.  You will not have to do these steps
	    manually.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Many free and commercial programs that provide a print

  <sect1 id="printing-intro-setup">
    <title>Basic Setup</title>

    <para>To use printers with the <application>LPD</application> spooling
      system, you will need to
      set up both your printer hardware and the 
      <application>LPD</application> software.  This
      document describes two levels of setup:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>See section <link linkend="printing-simple">Simple Printer
	  Setup</link> to learn how to connect a printer, tell 
	  <application>LPD</application> how to
	  communicate with it, and print plain text files to the
	  printer.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>See section <link linkend="printing-advanced">Advanced
	  Printer Setup</link> to find out how to print a variety of
	  special file formats, to print header pages, to print across a
	  network, to control access to printers, and to do printer
	  accounting.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <sect2 id="printing-simple">
      <title>Simple Printer Setup</title>

      <para>This section tells how to configure printer hardware and the
	<application>LPD</application> software to use the printer.  
	It teaches the basics:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Section <link linkend="printing-hardware">Hardware
	    Setup</link> gives some hints on connecting the printer to a
	    port on your computer.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Section <link linkend="printing-software">Software
	    Setup</link> shows how to set up the 
	    <application>LPD</application> spooler configuration
	    file (<filename>/etc/printcap</filename>).</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you are setting up a printer that uses a network protocol
	to accept data to print instead of a serial or parallel interface,
	see <link linkend="printing-advanced-network-net-if">Printers With
	Networked Data Stream Interfaces</link>.</para>

      <para>Although this section is called <quote>Simple Printer
	Setup</quote>, it is actually fairly complex.  Getting the printer
	to work with your computer and the <application>LPD</application>
	spooler is the hardest
	part.  The advanced options like header pages and accounting are
	fairly easy once you get the printer working.</para>

      <sect3 id="printing-hardware">
	<title>Hardware Setup</title>

	<para>This section tells about the various ways you can connect a
	  printer to your PC.  It talks about the kinds of ports and
	  cables, and also the kernel configuration you may need to enable
	  FreeBSD to speak to the printer.</para>

	<para>If you have already connected your printer and have
	  successfully printed with it under another operating system, you
	  can probably skip to section <link
	  linkend="printing-software">Software Setup</link>.</para>

	<sect4 id="printing-ports">
	  <title>Ports and Cables</title>

	  <para>Printers sold for use on PC's today generally come
	    with one or more of the following three interfaces:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <indexterm>
        <primary>printers</primary>
        <secondary>serial</secondary>
      </indexterm>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><emphasis>Serial</emphasis> interfaces, also known
		as RS232C or RS232D, or COM ports, use a serial port
		on your computer to send data to the printer.  Serial
		interfaces are common in the computer industry and cables
		are readily available and also easy to construct.  Serial
		interfaces sometimes need special cables and might require
		you to configure somewhat complex communications
		options.  Most PC serial ports have a maximum
	        transmission rate of 115200 bps, which makes printing
	        large graphic print jobs with them impractical.</para>
	    </listitem>

        <secondary>parallel</secondary>
      </indexterm>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><emphasis>Parallel</emphasis> interfaces use a
		parallel port on your computer to send data to the
		printer.  Parallel interfaces are common in the PC market
		and are faster than RS232 serial.
		Cables are readily available but more difficult to
		construct by hand.  There are usually no communications
		options with parallel interfaces, making their
		configuration exceedingly simple.</para>

	        <primary>centronics</primary>
		<see>parallel printers</see>
	      </indexterm>
	      <para>Parallel interfaces are sometimes known as

        <primary>printers</primary>
        <secondary>USB</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>USB interfaces, named for the Universal Serial
	        Bus, can run at even faster speeds than parallel or
	        RS232 serial interfaces.  Cables are simple and cheap.
	        USB is superior to RS232 Serial and to Parallel for
	        printing, but it is not as well supported under UNIX
	        systems.  A way to avoid this problem is to purchase a
	        printer that has both a USB interface and a Parallel
	        interface, as many printers do.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>In general, Parallel interfaces usually offer just
	    one-way communication (computer to printer) while serial
	    and USB gives you two-way. Newer parallel ports (EPP and
	    ECP) and printers
	    can communicate in both directions under FreeBSD when a
	    IEEE1284 compliant cable is used.</para>

	  <indexterm><primary>PostScript</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>Two-way communication to the printer over a parallel
	    port is generally done 1 of two ways.  The first method
	    uses a custom built printer driver for FreeBSD that speaks
	    the proprietary language used by the printer.  This is
	    common with inkjet printers and can be used for reporting
	    ink levels and other status information.  The second
	    method is used when the printer supports
	    &postscript;.</para>

	  <para>&postscript; jobs are
	    actually programs sent to the printer; they need not produce
	    paper at all and may return results directly to the computer.
	    &postscript; also uses two-way communication to tell the
	    computer about problems, such as errors in the &postscript;
	    program or paper jams.  Your users may be appreciative of such
	    information.  Furthermore, the best way to do effective
	    accounting with a &postscript; printer requires two-way
	    communication: you ask the printer for its page count (how
	    many pages it has printed in its lifetime), then send the
	    user's job, then ask again for its page count.  Subtract the
	    two values and you know how much paper to charge the
	    user.</para>

	<sect4 id="printing-parallel">
	  <title>Parallel Ports</title>

	  <para>To hook up a printer using a parallel interface, connect
	    the Centronics cable between the printer and the computer.
	    The instructions that came with the printer, the computer, or
	    both should give you complete guidance.</para>

	  <para>Remember which parallel port you used on the computer.
	    The first parallel port is <filename>/dev/ppc0</filename> to
	    FreeBSD; the second is <filename>/dev/ppc1</filename>, and so
	    on.  The printer device name uses the same scheme:
	    <filename>/dev/lpt0</filename> for the printer on the first
	    parallel ports etc.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="printing-serial">
	  <title>Serial Ports</title>

	  <para>To hook up a printer using a serial interface, connect the
	    proper serial cable between the printer and the computer.  The
	    instructions that came with the printer, the computer, or both
	    should give you complete guidance.</para>

	  <para>If you are unsure what the <quote>proper serial

	    alternatives:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>A <emphasis>modem</emphasis> cable connects each pin
		of the connector on one end of the cable straight through
		to its corresponding pin of the connector on the other
		end.  This type of cable is also known as a
		<quote>DTE-to-DCE</quote> cable.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <indexterm><primary>null-modem cable</primary></indexterm>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>A <emphasis>null-modem</emphasis> cable connects some
		pins straight through, swaps others (send data to receive
		data, for example), and shorts some internally in each

	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>A <emphasis>serial printer</emphasis> cable, required

	  <indexterm><primary>baud rate</primary></indexterm>
	  <indexterm><primary>parity</primary></indexterm>
	  <indexterm><primary>flow control protocol</primary></indexterm>
	  <para>You should also set up the communications parameters for
	    the printer, usually through front-panel controls or DIP
	    switches on the printer.  Choose the highest
	    <literal>bps</literal> (bits per second, sometimes
	    <emphasis>baud rate</emphasis>) rate that both your computer
	    and the printer can support.  Choose 7 or 8 data bits; none,
	    even, or odd parity; and 1 or 2 stop bits.  Also choose a flow
	    control protocol:  either none, or XON/XOFF (also known as
	    <quote>in-band</quote> or <quote>software</quote>) flow control.
	    Remember these settings for the software configuration that

	    that the printer can understand.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Users often expect that they can print plain text to any of

	  make the same assumption.
	  If you are installing such a printer and want to be able to

	  conversion program.  The section entitled <link
	  linkend="printing-advanced-if-conversion">Accommodating Plain
	  Text Jobs on &postscript; Printers</link> tells how to do
	  this.</para>

	<sect4 id="printing-naming">
	  <title>Naming the Printer</title>

	  <para>The first (easy) step is to pick a name for your printer
	    It really does not matter whether you choose functional or
	    whimsical names since you can also provide a number of aliases
	    for the printer.</para>

	  <para>At least one of the printers specified in the
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> should have the alias
	    <literal>lp</literal>.  This is the default printer's name.
	    If users do not have the <envar>PRINTER</envar> environment
	    variable nor specify a printer name on the command line of any
	    of the <application>LPD</application> commands, 
	    then <literal>lp</literal> will be the
	    default printer they get to use.</para>

	  <para>Also, it is common practice to make the last alias for a
	    printer be a full description of the printer, including make
	    and model.</para>

	  <para>Once you have picked a name and some common aliases, put
	    them in the <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file.  The name
	    of the printer should start in the leftmost column.  Separate
	    each alias with a vertical bar and put a colon after the last
	    alias.</para>

	  <para>In the following example, we start with a skeletal
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> that defines two printers

	  <indexterm><primary>printer spool</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>The next step in the simple spooler setup is to make a
	    <emphasis>spooling directory</emphasis>, a directory where
	    print jobs reside until they are printed, and where a number
	    of other spooler support files live.</para>

	  <para>Because of the variable nature of spooling directories, it
	    is customary to put these directories under
	    <filename>/var/spool</filename>.  It is not necessary to
	    backup the contents of spooling directories, either.
	    Recreating them is as simple as running &man.mkdir.1;.</para>

	  <para>It is also customary to make the directory with a name
	    that is identical to the name of the printer, as shown
	    below:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/spool/<replaceable>printer-name</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>However, if you have a lot of printers on your network,
	    you might want to put the spooling directories under a single
	    directory that you reserve just for printing with 
	    <application>LPD</application>.  We
	    will do this for our two example printers
	    <literal>rattan</literal> and
	    <literal>bamboo</literal>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/spool/lpd</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/spool/lpd/rattan</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /var/spool/lpd/bamboo</userinput></screen>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are concerned about the privacy of jobs that
	      users print, you might want to protect the spooling
	      directory so it is not publicly accessible.  Spooling
	      directories should be owned and be readable, writable, and
	      searchable by user daemon and group daemon, and no one else.
	      We will do this for our example printers:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/rattan</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/bamboo</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 770 /var/spool/lpd/rattan</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 770 /var/spool/lpd/bamboo</userinput></screen>
	  </note>

	  <para>Finally, you need to tell <application>LPD</application>
	    about these directories
	    using the <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file.  You
	    specify the pathname of the spooling directory with the
	    <literal>sd</literal> capability:</para>

	  <para>Note that the name of the printer starts in the first
	    column but all other entries describing the printer should be
	    indented with a tab and each line escaped with a
	    backslash.</para>

	  <para>If you do not specify a spooling directory with

	  </indexterm>

	  <para>We are now ready to tell <application>LPD</application>
	    what text filter to use to
	    send jobs to the printer.  A <emphasis>text filter</emphasis>,
	    also known as an <emphasis>input filter</emphasis>, is a
	    program that <application>LPD</application> runs when it 
	    has a job to print.  When <application>LPD</application>
	    runs the text filter for a printer, it sets the filter's
	    standard input to the job to print, and its standard output to
	    the printer device specified with the <literal>lp</literal>
	    capability.  The filter is expected to read the job from
	    standard input, perform any necessary translation for the
	    printer, and write the results to standard output, which will
	    get printed.  For more information on the text filter, see
	    the <link linkend="printing-advanced-filters">Filters</link>
	    section.</para>

	  <para>For our simple printer setup, the text filter can be a
	    small shell script that just executes
	    <command>/bin/cat</command> to send the job to the printer.
	    FreeBSD comes with another filter called
	    <filename>lpf</filename> that handles backspacing and
	    underlining for printers that might not deal with such
	    character streams well.  And, of course, you can use any other
	    filter program you want.  The filter <command>lpf</command> is
	    described in detail in section entitled <link
	    linkend="printing-advanced-lpf">lpf: a Text
	    Filter</link>.</para>

	  <para>First, let us make the shell script
	    <filename>/usr/local/libexec/if-simple</filename> be a simple
	    text filter.  Put the following text into that file with your
	    favorite text editor:</para>

	  <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
#
# if-simple - Simple text input filter for lpd
# Installed in /usr/local/libexec/if-simple
#
# Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.

/bin/cat &amp;&amp; exit 0
exit 2</programlisting>

	  <para>Make the file executable:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 555 /usr/local/libexec/if-simple</userinput></screen>

	  <para>And then tell LPD to use it by specifying it with the
	    <literal>if</literal> capability in
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.  We will add it to the two
	    printers we have so far in the example
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>:</para>

	    Unfortunately, congratulations are not quite yet in order,

	    print with the <application>LPD</application> system, you 
	    use the command &man.lpr.1;,
	    which submits a job for printing.</para>

	  <para>You can combine &man.lpr.1; with the &man.lptest.1;
	    program, introduced in section <link
	    linkend="printing-testing">Checking Printer
	    Communications</link> to generate some test text.</para>

	  <para><emphasis>To test the simple <application>LPD</application>

	  <para>Type:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>lptest 20 5 | lpr -P<replaceable>printer-name</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	  
	  <para>Where <replaceable>printer-name</replaceable> is a the
	    name of a printer (or an alias) specified in
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.  To test the default
	    printer, type &man.lpr.1; without any <option>-P</option>
	    argument.  Again, if you are testing a printer that expects
	    &postscript;, send a &postscript; program in that language instead
	    of using &man.lptest.1;.  You can do so by putting the program
	    in a file and typing <command>lpr 
	    <replaceable>file</replaceable></command>.</para>

	  <para>For a &postscript; printer, you should get the results of
	    the program.  If you are using &man.lptest.1;, then your
	    results should look like the following:</para>

	  <programlisting>!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./01234
"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./012345

%&amp;'()*+,-./012345678</programlisting>

	  <para>To further test the printer, try downloading larger
	    programs (for language-based printers) or running
	    &man.lptest.1; with different arguments.  For example,
	    <command>lptest 80 60</command> will produce 60 lines of 80

      <para>Although <application>LPD</application> handles network protocols,

        work happens in the <emphasis>filters</emphasis>.  Filters are
        programs that communicate with the printer and handle its device
        dependencies and special requirements.  In the simple printer setup,
        we installed a plain text filter&mdash;an extremely simple one that
        should work with most printers (section <link

      <para>However, in order to take advantage of format conversion, printer
        accounting, specific printer quirks, and so on, you should understand
        how filters work.  It will ultimately be the filter's responsibility
        to handle these aspects.  And the bad news is that most of the time
        <emphasis>you</emphasis> have to provide filters yourself.  The good
        news is that many are generally available; when they are not, they are
        usually easy to write.</para>
          
      <para>Also, FreeBSD comes with one,
        <filename>/usr/libexec/lpr/lpf</filename>, that works with many
        printers that can print plain text.  (It handles backspacing and tabs
        in the file, and does accounting, but that is about all it does.)
        There are also several filters and filter components in the FreeBSD

        <para>When <application>LPD</application> wants to print a file in a 
	  job, it starts a filter
          program.  It sets the filter's standard input to the file to print,
          its standard output to the printer, and its standard error to the
          error logging file (specified in the <literal>lf</literal>
          capability in <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>, or
          <filename>/dev/console</filename> by default).</para>

          <primary><command>troff</command></primary>
        </indexterm>
        <para>Which filter <application>LPD</application> starts and the 
	  filter's arguments depend on
          what is listed in the <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file and
          what arguments the user specified for the job on the      
            &man.lpr.1; command line.  For example, if the user typed
          <command>lpr -t</command>, <application>LPD</application> would
	  start the troff filter, listed
          in the <literal>tf</literal> capability for the destination printer.
          If the user wanted to print plain text, it would start the
          <literal>if</literal> filter (this is mostly true: see <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-of">Output Filters</link> for
          details).</para>

        <para>There are three kinds of filters you can specify in
          <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The <emphasis>text filter</emphasis>, confusingly called the
              <emphasis>input filter</emphasis> in 
	      <application>LPD</application> documentation, handles
              regular text printing.  Think of it as the default filter.  
	      <application>LPD</application>
              expects every printer to be able to print plain text by default,
              and it is the text filter's job to make sure backspaces, tabs,
              or other special characters do not confuse the printer.  If you
              are in an environment where you have to account for printer
              usage, the text filter must also account for pages printed,
              usually by counting the number of lines printed and comparing
              that to the number of lines per page the printer supports.  The
              text filter is started with the following argument list:

              <cmdsynopsis>
                <command>filter-name</command>

            <para>A <emphasis>conversion filter</emphasis> converts a specific
              file format into one the printer can render onto paper.  For
              example, ditroff typesetting data cannot be directly printed,
              but you can install a conversion filter for ditroff files to
              convert the ditroff data into a form the printer can digest and
              print.  Section <link
                linkend="printing-advanced-convfilters">Conversion
                Filters</link> tells all about them. Conversion filters also
              need to do accounting, if you need printer accounting.
              Conversion filters are started with the following arguments:

              <cmdsynopsis>
                <command>filter-name</command>
                <arg

              </cmdsynopsis>

              where <replaceable>pixel-width</replaceable> is the value
              from the <literal>px</literal> capability (default 0) and
              <replaceable>pixel-height</replaceable> is the value from the

          <listitem>
            <para>The <emphasis>output filter</emphasis> is used only if there
              is no text filter, or if header pages are enabled. In my
              experience, output filters are rarely used.  Section <link
                linkend="printing-advanced-of">Output Filters</link> describe
              them.  There are only two arguments to an output filter:

              <cmdsynopsis>
                <command>filter-name</command>
                <arg choice="plain">-w<replaceable>width</replaceable></arg>
                <arg choice="plain">-l<replaceable>length</replaceable></arg>
              </cmdsynopsis>

              which are identical to the text filters <option>-w</option> and
              <option>-l</option> arguments.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Filters should also <emphasis>exit</emphasis> with the
          following exit status:</para>

        </variablelist>

        <para>The text filter that comes with the FreeBSD release,
          <filename>/usr/libexec/lpr/lpf</filename>, takes advantage of the
          page width and length arguments to determine when to send a form
          feed and how to account for printer usage.  It uses the login, host,
          and accounting file arguments to make the accounting entries.</para>

        <para>If you are shopping for filters, see if they are LPD-compatible.
          If they are, they must support the argument lists described above.
          If you plan on writing filters for general use, then have them
          support the same argument lists and exit codes.</para>

        <para>If you are the only user of your computer and &postscript; (or

          text to your printer and to never use features of various programs

          setup.  To do so, we have the text filter detect if the arriving job
          is plain text or &postscript;.  All &postscript; jobs must start with
          <literal>%!</literal> (for other printer languages, see your printer

          we have &postscript;, and can pass the rest of the job directly.  If

        <para>If you have got a serial printer, a great way to do it is to
          install <command>lprps</command>.  <command>lprps</command> is a
          &postscript; printer filter which performs two-way communication with
          the printer.  It updates the printer's status file with verbose
          information from the printer, so users and administrators can see
          exactly what the state of the printer is (such as <errorname>toner
            low</errorname> or <errorname>paper jam</errorname>).  But more
          importantly, it includes a program called <command>psif</command>
          which detects whether the incoming job is plain text and calls
          <command>textps</command> (another program that comes with
          <command>lprps</command>) to convert it to &postscript;.  It then uses
          <command>lprps</command> to send the job to the printer.</para>
            
        <para><command>lprps</command> is part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection
          (see <link linkend="ports">The Ports Collection</link>).  You can
          fetch, build and install it yourself, of course.  After installing
          <command>lprps</command>, just specify the pathname to the
          <command>psif</command> program that is part of
          <command>lprps</command>.  If you installed <command>lprps</command>
          from the ports collection, use the following in the serial
          &postscript; printer's entry in
          <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>:</para>

        <para>You should also specify the <literal>rw</literal> capability;
          that tells <application>LPD</application> to open the printer in 
	  read-write mode.</para>
            
        <para>If you have a parallel &postscript; printer (and therefore cannot
          use two-way communication with the printer, which
          <command>lprps</command> needs), you can use the following shell
          script as the text filter:</para>

        <para>&postscript; is the <emphasis>de facto</emphasis> standard for
          high quality typesetting and printing.  &postscript; is, however, an
          <emphasis>expensive</emphasis> standard. Thankfully, Aladdin
          Enterprises has a free &postscript; work-alike called
          <application>Ghostscript</application> that runs with FreeBSD.
          Ghostscript can read most &postscript; files and can render their
          pages onto a variety of devices, including many brands of
          non-PostScript printers.  By installing Ghostscript and using a
          special text filter for your printer, you can make your
          non &postscript; printer act like a real &postscript; printer.</para>
            
        <para>Ghostscript is in the FreeBSD Ports Collection, if you
          would like to install it from there.  You can fetch, build, and
          install it quite easily yourself, as well.</para>
            
        <para>To simulate &postscript;, we have the text filter detect if it is
          printing a &postscript; file.  If it is not, then the filter will pass
          the file directly to the printer; otherwise, it will use Ghostscript
          to first convert the file into a format the printer will
          understand.</para>
            
        <para>Here is an example: the following script is a text filter
          for Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 printers.  For other printers,
          substitute the <option>-sDEVICE</option> argument to the
          <command>gs</command> (Ghostscript) command.  (Type <command>gs
            -h</command> to get a list of devices the current installation of
          Ghostscript supports.)</para>

    #  Note that PostScript files are actually interpreted programs,
    #  and those programs are allowed to write to stdout, which will
    #  mess up the printed output.  So, we redirect stdout to stderr
    #  and then make descriptor 3 go to stdout, and have Ghostscript
    #  write its output there.  Exercise for the clever reader:
    #  capture the stderr output from Ghostscript and mail it back to
    #  the user originating the print job.

          <para>Conversion filters make printing various kinds of files easy.
            As an example, suppose we do a lot of work with the &tex;
            typesetting system, and we have a &postscript; printer.  Every time
            we generate a DVI file from &tex;, we cannot print it directly until
            we convert the DVI file into &postscript;.  The command sequence
            goes like this:</para>
                
          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>dvips seaweed-analysis.dvi</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>lpr seaweed-analysis.ps</userinput></screen>
                
          <para>By installing a conversion filter for DVI files, we can skip
            the hand conversion step each time by having 
	    <application>LPD</application> do it for us.
            Now, each time we get a DVI file, we are just one step away from
            printing it:</para>
              
          <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lpr -d seaweed-analysis.dvi</userinput></screen>
                
          <para>We got <application>LPD</application> to do the DVI file 
	    conversion for us by specifying
            the <option>-d</option> option.  Section <link
              linkend="printing-lpr-options-format">Formatting and Conversion
              Options</link> lists the conversion options.</para>
              
          <para>For each of the conversion options you want a printer to
            support, install a <emphasis>conversion filter</emphasis> and
            specify its pathname in <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.  A
            conversion filter is like the text filter for the simple printer
            setup (see section <link linkend="printing-textfilter">Installing
              the Text Filter</link>) except that instead of printing plain
            text, the filter converts the file into a format the printer can
            understand.</para>

          <title>Which Conversions Filters Should I Install?</title>
          
          <para>You should install the conversion filters you expect to use.
            If you print a lot of DVI data, then a DVI conversion filter is in
            order.  If you have got plenty of troff to print out, then you
            probably want a troff filter.</para>
              
          <para>The following table summarizes the filters that 
	    <application>LPD</application> works
            with, their capability entries for the

            <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  The directory
            <filename>/usr/local/libexec</filename> is a popular location,
            since they are specialized programs that only

          <para>Here is an example that might make old hands at FORTRAN blush.
            It is a FORTRAN-text filter for any printer that can directly

            <literal>teak</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

exit 2</programlisting>
              
          <para>And we will add this line to the

            <literal>teak</literal> to enable this filter:</para>
              
          <programlisting>:rf=/usr/local/libexec/hprf:</programlisting>
              
          <para>Here is one final, somewhat complex example.  We will add a
            DVI filter to the LaserJet printer <literal>teak</literal>
            introduced earlier.  First, the easy part: updating
            <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> with the location of the DVI
            filter:</para>
              
          <programlisting>:df=/usr/local/libexec/hpdf:</programlisting>
              
          <para>Now, for the hard part: making the filter.  For that, we need
            a DVI-to-LaserJet/PCL conversion program.  The FreeBSD Ports
            Collection (see <link linkend="ports">The Ports Collection</link>)
            has one: <command>dvi2xx</command> is the name of the package.
            Installing this package gives us the program we need,
            <command>dvilj2p</command>, which converts DVI into LaserJet IIp,
            LaserJet III, and LaserJet 2000 compatible codes.</para>
              
          <para><command>dvilj2p</command> makes the filter
            <command>hpdf</command> quite complex since
            <command>dvilj2p</command> cannot read from standard input.  It
            wants to work with a filename. What is worse, the filename has to
            end in <filename>.dvi</filename> so using
            <filename>/dev/fd/0</filename> for standard input is problematic.
            We can get around that problem by linking (symbolically) a
            temporary file name (one that ends in <filename>.dvi</filename>)
            to <filename>/dev/fd/0</filename>, thereby forcing
            <command>dvilj2p</command> to read from standard input.</para>
              
          <para>The only other fly in the ointment is the fact that we cannot
            use <filename>/tmp</filename> for the temporary link. Symbolic
            links are owned by user and group <username>bin</username>.  The
            filter runs as user <username>daemon</username>.  And the
            <filename>/tmp</filename> directory has the sticky bit set. The
            filter can create the link, but it will not be able clean up when
            done and remove it since the link will belong to a different
            user.</para>
              
          <para>Instead, the filter will make the symbolic link in the current
            working directory, which is the spooling directory (specified by
            the <literal>sd</literal> capability in
            <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>).  This is a perfect place for
            filters to do their work, especially since there is (sometimes)
            more free disk space in the spooling directory than under
            <filename>/tmp</filename>.</para>
              
          <para>Here, finally, is the filter:</para>

          <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
#
#  hpdf - Print DVI data on HP/PCL printer
#  Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hpdf

PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH; export PATH

#
#  Define a function to clean up our temporary files.  These exist

#
cleanup() {
   rm -f hpdf$$.dvi
}

#
#  Define a function to handle fatal errors: print the given message

#  job.
#
fatal() {
    echo "$@" 1&gt;&amp;2
    cleanup
    exit 2
}

#
#  If user removes the job, LPD will send SIGINT, so trap SIGINT
#  (and a few other signals) to clean up after ourselves.
#
trap cleanup 1 2 15 

#
#  Make sure we are not colliding with any existing files.

cleanup

          <para>All these conversion filters accomplish a lot for your
            printing environment, but at the cost forcing the user to specify
            (on the &man.lpr.1; command line) which one to use.
            If your users are not particularly computer literate, having to
            specify a filter option will become annoying.  What is worse,
            though, is that an incorrectly specified filter option may run a

              it is not intended to do accounting.  In fact, it gets only two

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Do not be seduced by an output filter's simplicity.  If you

          filter <emphasis>will not work</emphasis>.  Use a text filter (also
          known as an input filter); see section <link
            linkend="printing-textfilter">Installing the Text Filter</link>.
          Furthermore, an output filter is actually <emphasis>more
            complex</emphasis> in that it has to examine the byte stream being
          sent to it for special flag characters and must send signals to
          itself on behalf of <application>LPD</application>.</para>
            
        <para>However, an output filter is <emphasis>necessary</emphasis> if
          you want header pages and need to send escape sequences or other
          initialization strings to be able to print the header page.  (But it
          is also <emphasis>futile</emphasis> if you want to charge header
          pages to the requesting user's account, since 
	  <application>LPD</application> does not give any
          user or host information to the output filter.)</para>
            
        <para>On a single printer, <application>LPD</application>
	  allows both an output filter and text or other filters.  In
	  such cases, <application>LPD</application> will start the
	  output filter
          to print the header page (see section <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-header-pages">Header Pages</link>)
          only.  <application>LPD</application> then expects the
	  output filter to <emphasis>stop
            itself</emphasis> by sending two bytes to the filter: ASCII 031
          followed by ASCII 001.  When an output filter sees these two bytes
          (031, 001), it should stop by sending <literal>SIGSTOP</literal>
	  to itself.  When 
	  <application>LPD</application>'s
          done running other filters, it will restart the output filter by
          sending <literal>SIGCONT</literal> to it.</para>
            
        <para>If there is an output filter but <emphasis>no</emphasis> text
          filter and <application>LPD</application> is working on a plain
	  text job, <application>LPD</application> uses the output
          filter to do the job.  As stated before, the output filter will

        stand out from the real documents that comprise users' jobs.  They
        enable users to locate their jobs quickly.  The obvious drawback to a
        header page is that it is yet one more sheet that has to be printed
        for every job, their ephemeral usefulness lasting not more than a few
        minutes, ultimately finding themselves in a recycling bin or rubbish
        heap.  (Note that header pages go with each job, not each file in a

        <para>Using <application>LPD</application>'s built-in header pages
	  enforces a particular paradigm
          when it comes to printer accounting: header pages must be
          <emphasis>free of charge</emphasis>.</para>
            
        <para>Why?</para>

        <para>Because the output filter is the only external program that will
          have control when the header page is printed that could do
          accounting, and it is not provided with any <emphasis>user or
            host</emphasis> information or an accounting file, so it has no
          idea whom to charge for printer use.  It is also not enough to just
          <quote>add one page</quote> to the text filter or any of the
          conversion filters (which do have user and host information) since
          users can suppress header pages with <command>lpr -h</command>.
          They could still be charged for header pages they did not print.
          Basically, <command>lpr -h</command> will be the preferred option of
          environmentally-minded users, but you cannot offer any incentive to
          use it.</para>
            
        <para>It is <emphasis>still not enough</emphasis> to have each of the
          filters generate their own header pages (thereby being able to
          charge for them).  If users wanted the option of suppressing the
          header pages with <command>lpr -h</command>, they will still get
          them and be charged for them since <application>LPD</application>
	  does not pass any knowledge
          of the <option>-h</option> option to any of the filters.</para>

        <para>So, what are your options?</para>

            <para>Write a <emphasis>smart</emphasis> output filter. Normally,
              an output filter is not meant to do anything more than
              initialize a printer or do some simple character conversion.  It
              is suited for header pages and plain text jobs (when there is no
              text (input) filter).  But, if there is a text filter for the
              plain text jobs, then <application>LPD</application> will start
	      the output filter only for
              the header pages.  And the output filter can parse the header
              page text that <application>LPD</application> generates to
	      determine what user and host to
              charge for the header page.  The only other problem with this
              method is that the output filter still does not know what
              accounting file to use (it is not passed the name of the file
              from the <literal>af</literal> capability), but if you have a
              well-known accounting file, you can hard-code that into the
              output filter.  To facilitate the parsing step, use the
              <literal>sh</literal> (short header) capability in
              <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.  Then again, all that might
              be too much trouble, and users will certainly appreciate the
              more generous system administrator who makes header pages
              free.</para>

        <title>Header Pages on &postscript; Printers</title>

        <para>As described above, <application>LPD</application> can generate
	  a plain text header page
          suitable for many printers.  Of course, &postscript; cannot directly
          print plain text, so the header page feature of 
	  <application>LPD</application> is
          useless&mdash;or mostly so.</para>
            
        <para>One obvious way to get header pages is to have every conversion
          filter and the text filter generate the header page. The filters
          should use the user and host arguments to generate a suitable
          header page.  The drawback of this method is that users will always
          get a header page, even if they submit jobs with <command>lpr
            -h</command>.</para>
            
        <para>Let us explore this method.  The following script takes three
          arguments (user login name, host name, and job name) and makes a
          simple &postscript; header page:</para>

        <para>Now, each of the conversion filters and the text filter can call
          this script to first generate the header page, and then print the

          document, modified to make a header page:</para>

        <para>Notice how the filter has to parse the argument list in order to
          determine the user and host name.  The parsing for the other
          conversion filters is identical.  The text filter takes a slightly
          different set of arguments, though (see section <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-filters">How      Filters
            Work</link>).</para>
            
        <para>As we have mentioned before, the above scheme, though fairly
          simple, disables the <quote>suppress header page</quote> option (the
          <option>-h</option> option) to <command>lpr</command>.  If users
          wanted to save a tree (or a few pennies, if you charge for header
          pages), they would not be able to do so, since every filter's going
          to print a header page with every job.</para>
            
        <para>To allow users to shut off header pages on a per-job basis, you
          will need to use the trick introduced in section <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-header-pages-accounting">Accounting for
            Header Pages</link>: write an output filter that parses the
          LPD-generated header page and produces a &postscript; version.  If the
          user submits the job with <command>lpr -h</command>, then 
	  <application>LPD</application> will
          not generate a header page, and neither will your output filter.
          Otherwise, your output filter will read the text from 
	  <application>LPD</application> and send

        <para>Here is an example.  The host <hostid>rose</hostid> has two

        <para>Then, we just need to make spooling directories on

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd/rattan /var/spool/lpd/bamboo</userinput>

&prompt.root; <userinput>chown daemon:daemon /var/spool/lpd/rattan /var/spool/lpd/bamboo</userinput></screen>
              
        <para>Now, users on <hostid>orchid</hostid> can print to
          <literal>rattan</literal> and <literal>bamboo</literal>.  If, for
          example, a user on <hostid>orchid</hostid> typed

          the <application>LPD</application> system on <hostid>orchid</hostid>
	  would copy the job to the spooling
          directory <filename>/var/spool/lpd/bamboo</filename> and note that it was a
          DVI job.  As soon as the host <hostid>rose</hostid> has room in its
          <literal>bamboo</literal> spooling directory, the two 
	  <application>LPDs</application> would transfer the
          file to <hostid>rose</hostid>.  The file would wait in <hostid>rose</hostid>'s
          queue until it was finally printed.  It would be converted from DVI to
          &postscript; (since <literal>bamboo</literal> is a &postscript; printer) on
          <hostid>rose</hostid>.</para>

        <title>Printers with Networked Data Stream Interfaces</title>

        <para>Often, when you buy a network interface card for a printer, you
          can get two versions: one which emulates a spooler (the more
          expensive version), or one which just lets you send data to it as if
          you were using a serial or parallel port (the cheaper version).
          This section tells how to use the cheaper version. For the more
          expensive one, see the previous section <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-network-rm">Printers Installed on
            Remote Hosts</link>.</para>
            
        <para>The format of the <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file lets
          you specify what serial or parallel interface to use, and (if you
          are using a serial interface), what baud rate, whether to use flow
          control, delays for tabs, conversion of newlines, and more.  But
          there is no way to specify a connection to a printer that is
          listening on a TCP/IP or other network port.</para>
            
        <para>To send data to a networked printer, you need to develop a
          communications program that can be called by the text and conversion
          filters.  Here is one such example: the script
          <command>netprint</command> takes all data on standard input and
          sends it to a network-attached printer.  We specify the hostname of
          the printer as the first argument and the port number to which to
          connect as the second argument to <command>netprint</command>.  Note
          that this supports one-way communication only (FreeBSD to printer);
          many network printers support two-way communication, and you might
          want to take advantage of that (to get printer status, perform
          accounting, etc.).</para>

        <para>If you have many users accessing the printers, you probably need
          to put an upper limit on the sizes of the files users can submit to
          print.  After all, there is only so much free space on the
          filesystem that houses the spooling directories, and you also need
          to make sure there is room for the jobs of other users.</para>

        </indexterm>
        <para><application>LPD</application> enables you to limit the maximum
	  byte size a file in a job
          can be with the <literal>mx</literal> capability. The units are in
          <literal>BUFSIZ</literal> blocks, which are 1024 bytes.  If you put
	  a zero for this
          capability, there will be no limit on file size; however, if no
          <literal>mx</literal> capability is specified, then a default limit
          of 1000 blocks will be used.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The limit applies to <emphasis>files</emphasis> in a job, and
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> the total job size.</para>
        </note>

        <para><application>LPD</application> will not refuse a file that is
	  larger than the limit you
          place on a printer.  Instead, it will queue as much of the file up
          to the limit, which will then get printed.  The rest will be
          discarded.  Whether this is correct behavior is up for
          debate.</para>
            
        <para>Let us add limits to our example printers
          <literal>rattan</literal> and <literal>bamboo</literal>.  Since
          those artists' &postscript; files tend to be large, we will limit them
          to five megabytes. We will put no limit on the plain text line
          printer:</para>

        <programlisting>#

        <para>Again, the limits apply to the local users only.  If you have
          set up access to your printers remotely, remote users will not get
          those limits.  You will need to specify the <literal>mx</literal>

        <secondary>printer</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>So, you need to charge for printouts.  And why not? Paper and ink
        cost money.  And then there are maintenance costs&mdash;printers are
        loaded with moving parts and tend to break down.  You have examined
        your printers, usage patterns, and maintenance fees and have come up
        with a per-page (or per-foot, per-meter, or per-whatever) cost.  Now,
        how do you actually start accounting for printouts?</para>
          
      <para>Well, the bad news is the <application>LPD</application> spooling
	system does not provide
        much help in this department.  Accounting is highly dependent on the
        kind of printer in use, the formats being printed, and
        <emphasis>your</emphasis> requirements in charging for printer
        usage.</para>
      
      <para>To implement accounting, you have to modify a printer's text
        filter (to charge for plain text jobs) and the conversion filters (to
        charge for other file formats), to count pages or query the printer
        for pages printed.  You cannot get away with using the simple output
        filter, since it cannot do accounting.  See section <link
          linkend="printing-advanced-filter-intro">Filters</link>.</para>
          
      <para>Generally, there are two ways to do accounting:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Periodic accounting</emphasis> is the more common
            way, possibly because it is easier.  Whenever someone prints a
            job, the filter logs the user, host, and number of pages to an
            accounting file.  Every month, semester, year, or whatever time
            period you prefer, you collect the accounting files for the
            various printers, tally up the pages printed by users, and charge
            for usage.  Then you truncate all the logging files, starting with
            a clean slate for the next period.</para>
        </listitem>
              
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Timely accounting</emphasis> is less common,
            probably because it is more difficult.  This method has the
            filters charge users for printouts as soon as they use the
            printers.  Like disk quotas, the accounting is immediate. You can
            prevent users from printing when their account goes in the red,
            and might provide a way for users to check and adjust their
            <quote>print quotas.</quote> But this method requires some database
            code to track users and their quotas.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>The <application>LPD</application> spooling system supports both 
	methods easily: since you
        have to provide the filters (well, most of the time), you also have to
        provide the accounting code.  But there is a bright side: you have
        enormous flexibility in your accounting methods.  For example, you
        choose whether to use periodic or timely accounting. You choose what
        information to log: user names, host names, job types, pages printed,
        square footage of paper used, how long the job took to print, and so
        forth.  And you do so by modifying the filters to save this
        information.</para>
          
      <sect3>
        <title>Quick and Dirty Printer Accounting</title>

        <para>FreeBSD comes with two programs that can get you set up with
          simple periodic accounting right away.  They are the text filter
          <command>lpf</command>, described in section <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-lpf">lpf: a Text Filter</link>, and
            &man.pac.8;, a program to gather and total
          entries from printer accounting files.</para>

        <para>As mentioned in the section on filters (<link
            linkend="printing-advanced-filters">Filters</link>), 
	  <application>LPD</application> starts
          the text and the conversion filters with the name of the accounting
          file to use on the filter command line.  The filters can use this
          argument to know where to write an accounting file entry.  The name
          of this file comes from the <literal>af</literal> capability in
          <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>, and if not specified as an
          absolute path, is relative to the spooling directory.</para>

        <para><application>LPD</application> starts <command>lpf</command>
	  with page width and length
          arguments (from the <literal>pw</literal> and <literal>pl</literal>
          capabilities).  <command>lpf</command> uses these arguments to
          determine how much paper will be used.  After sending the file to
          the printer, it then writes an accounting entry in the accounting
          file.  The entries look like this:</para>

        <programlisting>2.00 rose:andy
3.00 rose:kelly
3.00 orchid:mary
5.00 orchid:mary
2.00 orchid:zhang</programlisting>
            
        <para>You should use a separate accounting file for each printer, as
          <command>lpf</command> has no file locking logic built into it, and
          two <command>lpf</command>s might corrupt each other's entries if
          they were to write to the same file at the same time.  An easy way
          to insure a separate accounting file for each printer is to use
          <literal>af=acct</literal> in <filename>/etc/printcap</filename>.
          Then, each accounting file will be in the spooling directory for a
          printer, in a file named <filename>acct</filename>.</para>
            
        <para>When you are ready to charge users for printouts, run the
            &man.pac.8; program.  Just change to the spooling directory for
          the printer you want to collect on and type <literal>pac</literal>.
          You will get a dollar-centric summary like the following:</para>
            
        <screen>  Login               pages/feet   runs    price
orchid:kelly                5.00    1   $  0.10

        <para>In the default summary that &man.pac.8; produces, you see the
          number of pages printed by each user from various hosts.  If, at
          your site, host does not matter (because users can use any host),
          run <command>pac -m</command>, to produce the following
          summary:</para>
              
        <screen>  Login               pages/feet   runs    price
andy                        2.00    1   $  0.04
kelly                     182.00  105   $  3.64
mary                      118.00   35   $  2.36
root                       26.00   12   $  0.52
zhang                       9.00    1   $  0.18

total                     337.00  154   $  6.74</screen>
              

        <para>To compute the dollar amount due,
            &man.pac.8; uses the <literal>pc</literal> capability in the
          <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file (default of 200, or 2 cents
          per page).  Specify, in hundredths of cents, the price per page or
          per foot you want to charge for printouts in this capability.  You
          can override this value when you run &man.pac.8; with the
          <option>-p</option> option.  The units for the <option>-p</option>
          option are in dollars, though, not hundredths of cents.  For
          example,
              
          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pac -p1.50</userinput></screen>
              
          makes each page cost one dollar and fifty cents.  You can really
          rake in the profits by using this option.</para>

        <para>Finally, running <command>pac -s</command> will save the summary
          information in a summary accounting file, which is named the same as
          the printer's accounting file, but with <literal>_sum</literal>
          appended to the name.  It then truncates the accounting file.  When
          you run &man.pac.8; again, it rereads the
          summary file to get starting totals, then adds information from the
          regular accounting file.</para>

        <title>How Can You Count Pages Printed?</title>

        <para>In order to perform even remotely accurate accounting, you need
          to be able to determine how much paper a job uses.  This is the
          essential problem of printer accounting.</para>
            
        <para>For plain text jobs, the problem is not that hard to solve: you
          count how many lines are in a job and compare it to how many lines
          per page your printer supports.  Do not forget to take into account
          backspaces in the file which overprint lines, or long logical lines
          that wrap onto one or more additional physical lines.</para>
            
        <para>The text filter <command>lpf</command> (introduced in <link
            linkend="printing-advanced-lpf">lpf: a Text Filter</link>) takes
          into account these things when it does accounting.  If you are
          writing a text filter which needs to do accounting, you might want
          to examine <command>lpf</command>'s source code.</para>
            
        <para>How do you handle other file formats, though?</para>

        <para>Well, for DVI-to-LaserJet or DVI-to-&postscript; conversion, you
          can have your filter parse the diagnostic output of
          <command>dvilj</command> or <command>dvips</command> and look to see
          how many pages were converted.  You might be able to do similar
          things with other file formats and conversion programs.</para>

        <para>But these methods suffer from the fact that the printer may not
          actually print all those pages.  For example, it could jam, run out
          of toner, or explode&mdash;and the user would still get
          charged.</para>
            
        <para>So, what can you do?</para>

        <para>There is only one <emphasis>sure</emphasis> way to do
          <emphasis>accurate</emphasis> accounting.  Get a printer that can
          tell you how much paper it uses, and attach it via a serial line or
          a network connection.  Nearly all &postscript; printers support this
          notion.  Other makes and models do as well (networked Imagen laser
          printers, for example).  Modify the filters for these printers to
          get the page usage after they print each job and have them log
          accounting information based on that value
          <emphasis>only</emphasis>.  There is no line counting nor
          error-prone file examination required.</para>
            
        <para>Of course, you can always be generous and make all printouts
          free.</para>

    <para>There is also an administrative command, &man.lpc.8;, described in
      the section <link linkend="printing-lpc">Administering the 
	<application>LPD</application>
	Spooler</link>, used to control printers and their queues.</para>

    <para>All three of the commands &man.lpr.1;, &man.lprm.1;, and &man.lpq.1;
      accept an option <option>-P
	<replaceable>printer-name</replaceable></option> to specify on which
      printer/queue to operate, as listed in the
      <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file.  This enables you to submit,
      remove, and check on jobs for various printers.  If you do not use the
      <option>-P</option> option, then these commands use the printer
      specified in the <envar>PRINTER</envar> environment variable.  Finally,
      if you do not have a <envar>PRINTER</envar> environment variable, these
      commands default to the printer named <literal>lp</literal>.</para>

    <para>Hereafter, the terminology <emphasis>default printer</emphasis>
      means the printer named in the <envar>PRINTER</envar> environment
      variable, or the printer named <literal>lp</literal> when there is no
      <envar>PRINTER</envar> environment variable.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>printing</primary></indexterm>
      <para>This prints each of the listed files to the default printer.  If
	you list no files, &man.lpr.1; reads data to
	print from standard input.  For example, this command prints some
	important system files:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lpr /etc/host.conf /etc/hosts.equiv</userinput></screen>
	    
      <para>To select a specific printer, type:</para>
		    
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lpr -P <replaceable>printer-name</replaceable> <replaceable>filename</replaceable> <replaceable>...</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>This example prints a long listing of the current directory to the
	printer named <literal>rattan</literal>:</para>
	    
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ls -l | lpr -P rattan</userinput></screen>
	    
      <para>Because no files were listed for the

	  -l</command> command.</para>
      
      <para>The &man.lpr.1; command can also accept a wide variety of options
	to control formatting, apply file conversions, generate multiple

    <sect2 id="printing-lpq">
      <title>Checking Jobs</title>
      
      <indexterm><primary>print jobs</primary></indexterm>
      <para>When you print with &man.lpr.1;, the data you wish to print is put
	together in a package called a <quote>print job</quote>, which is sent
	to the <application>LPD</application> spooling system.  Each printer 
	has a queue of jobs, and
	your job waits in that queue along with other jobs from yourself and
	from other users.  The printer prints those jobs in a first-come,
	first-served order.</para>

      <para>To display the queue for the default printer, type &man.lpq.1;.
	For a specific printer, use the <option>-P</option> option.  For
	example, the command

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lpq -P bamboo</userinput></screen>

	shows the queue for the printer named <literal>bamboo</literal>.  Here
	is an example of the output of the <command>lpq</command>
	command:</para>
	    
      <screen>bamboo is ready and printing

      <para>This shows three jobs in the queue for <literal>bamboo</literal>.
	The first job, submitted by user kelly, got assigned <quote>job
	number</quote> 9.  Every job for a printer gets a unique job number.
	Most of the time you can ignore the job number, but you will need it
	if you want to cancel the job; see section <link
	  linkend="printing-lprm">Removing Jobs</link> for details.</para>
	  
      <para>Job number nine consists of two files; multiple files given on the
	  &man.lpr.1; command line are treated as part of a single job.  It
	is the currently active job (note the word <literal>active</literal>
	under the <quote>Rank</quote> column), which means the printer should
	be currently printing that job.  The second job consists of data
	passed as the standard input to the &man.lpr.1; command.  The third
	  job came from user <username>mary</username>; it is a much larger
	  job. The pathname of the file she is trying to print is too long to
	  fit, so the &man.lpq.1; command just shows three dots.</para>

      <para>The very first line of the output from &man.lpq.1; is also useful:
	it tells what the printer is currently doing (or at least what 
	<application>LPD</application> thinks the printer is doing).</para>

      <para>The &man.lpq.1; command also support a <option>-l</option> option
	to generate a detailed long listing.  Here is an example of

      <title>Removing Jobs</title>
      
      <para>If you change your mind about printing a job, you can remove the
	job from the queue with the &man.lprm.1; command.  Often, you can
	even use &man.lprm.1; to remove an active job, but some or all of the
	job might still get printed.</para>
	  
      <para>To remove a job from the default printer, first use
	  &man.lpq.1; to find the job number.  Then type:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lprm <replaceable>job-number</replaceable></userinput></screen>
	    
      <para>To remove the job from a specific printer, add the
	<option>-P</option> option.  The following command removes job number
	10 from the queue for the printer <literal>bamboo</literal>:</para>
	    
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lprm -P bamboo 10</userinput></screen>
      
      <para>The &man.lprm.1; command has a few shortcuts:</para>
      
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>lprm -</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Removes all jobs (for the default printer) belonging to

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Removes all jobs (for the default printer) belonging to
	      <replaceable>user</replaceable>.  The superuser can remove other
	      users' jobs; you can remove only your own jobs.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>lprm</term>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>With no job number, user name, or <option>-</option>
	      appearing on the command line,
		    &man.lprm.1; removes the currently active job on the
	      default printer, if it belongs to you.  The superuser can remove
	      any active job.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>Just use the <option>-P</option> option with the above shortcuts
	to operate on a specific printer instead of the default. For example,
	the following command removes all jobs for the current user in the
	queue for the printer named <literal>rattan</literal>:</para>
	  
      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lprm -P rattan -</userinput></screen>
	  
      <note>
	<para>If you are working in a networked environment, &man.lprm.1; will
	  let you remove jobs only from the
	  host from which the jobs were submitted, even if the same printer is
	  available from other hosts. The following command sequence
	  demonstrates this:</para>
	      
	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>lpr -P rattan myfile</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>rlogin orchid</userinput>

      <title>Beyond Plain Text: Printing Options</title>
      
      <para>The &man.lpr.1; command supports a number of options that control
	formatting text, converting graphic and other file formats, producing

	    PRINT REMAINING or FORM FEED button on the printer to get any
	    results to appear.</para>

	  <para>If this is the case, the printer was probably waiting to
	    see if there was any more data for your job before it printed
	    anything.  To fix this problem, you can have the text filter
	    send a FORM FEED character (or whatever is necessary) to the
	    printer.  This is usually sufficient to have the printer
	    immediately print any text remaining in its internal buffer.
	    It is also useful to make sure each print job ends on a full

	    of the last page of the previous job.</para>

	    13 (the carriage return or CR).  Many printers use the &ms-dos;
	    convention for representing new-lines.</para>

	  <para>When you print with FreeBSD, your text used just the line
	    feed character.  The printer, upon seeing a line feed
	    character, advanced the paper one line, but maintained the
	    same horizontal position on the page for the next character

      <varlistentry>
	<term>It printed garbage.</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The printer printed what appeared to be random garbage,
	    but not the desired text.</para>

	  <para>This is usually another symptom of incorrect
	    communications parameters with a serial printer.  Double-check
	    the bps rate in the <literal>br</literal> capability, and the
	    parity setting in the
	    <literal>ms#</literal> capability; make sure the printer is
	    using the same settings as specified in the
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Nothing happened.</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If nothing happened, the problem is probably within
	    FreeBSD and not the hardware.  Add the log file
	    (<literal>lf</literal>) capability to the entry for the
	    printer you are debugging in the
	    <filename>/etc/printcap</filename> file.  For example, here is
	    the entry for <literal>rattan</literal>, with the
	    <literal>lf</literal> capability:</para>

	  <programlisting>rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
        :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
        :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:\
        :lf=/var/log/rattan.log</programlisting>

	  <para>Then, try printing again.  Check the log file (in our
	    example, <filename>/var/log/rattan.log</filename>) to see any
	    error messages that might appear.  Based on the messages you
	    see, try to correct the problem.</para>

	  <para>If you do not specify a <literal>lf</literal> capability,
	    <application>LPD</application> uses 
	    <filename>/dev/console</filename> as a default.</para>
