    <title>Synopsis</title>
    
    <para>FreeBSD allows multiple users to use the computer at the same time.
      Obviously, only one of those users can be sitting in front of the screen and
      keyboard at any one time
      <footnote>
	<para>Well, unless you hook up multiple terminals, but we will
	save that for <xref linkend="serialcomms">.</para>
      </footnote>, but any number of users can log in through the
      network to get their work done.  To use the system every user must have
      an account.</para>

  <sect1 id="users-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>All access to the system is achieved via accounts, and all
      processes are run by users, so user and account management are
      of integral importance on FreeBSD systems.</para>

    <para>Every account on a FreeBSD system has certain information associated
      with it to identify the account.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>User name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name as it would be typed at the
	    <prompt>login:</prompt> prompt.  User names must be unique across
	    the computer; you may not have two users with the same
	    user name.  There are a number of rules for creating valid user
	    names, documented in &man.passwd.5;; you would typically use user
	    names that consist of eight or fewer all lower case
	    characters.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Each account has a password associated with it.  The password
	    may be blank, in which case no password will be required to access
	    the system.  This is normally a very bad idea; every account
	    should have a password.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User ID (UID)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The UID is a number, traditionally from 0 to 65535<footnote id="users-largeuidgid">
	      <para>It is possible to use UID/GIDs as large as
		4294967295, but such IDs can cause serious problems
		with software that makes assumptions about the values
		of IDs.</para>
	    </footnote>, used to uniquely identify
	    the user to the system.  Internally, FreeBSD uses the UID to
	    identify users&mdash;any FreeBSD commands that allow you to
	    specify a user name will convert it to the UID before working with
	    it.  This means that you can have several accounts with different
	    user names but the same UID.  As far as FreeBSD is concerned these
	    accounts are one user.  It is unlikely you will ever need to do
	    this.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Group ID (GID)</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The GID is a number, traditionally from 0 to 65535<footnoteref linkend="users-largeuidgid">, used to uniquely identify
	    the primary group that the user belongs to.  Groups are a
	    mechanism for controlling access to resources based on a user's
	    GID rather than their UID.  This can significantly reduce the size
	    of some configuration files.  A user may also be in more than one
	    group.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Login class</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Login classes are an extension to the group mechanism that
	    provide additional flexibility when tailoring the system to
	    different users.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Password change time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default FreeBSD does not force users to change their
	    passwords periodically.  You can enforce this on a per-user basis,
	    forcing some or all of your users to change their passwords after
	    a certain amount of time has elapsed.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Account expiry time</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>By default FreeBSD does not expire accounts.  If you are
	    creating accounts that you know have a limited lifespan, for
	    example, in a school where you have accounts for the students,
	    then you can specify when the account expires.  After the expiry
	    time has elapsed the account cannot be used to log in to the
	    system, although the account's directories and files will
	    remain.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User's full name</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The user name uniquely identifies the account to FreeBSD, but
	    does not necessarily reflect the user's real name.  This
	    information can be associated with the account.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Home directory</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The home directory is the full path to a directory on the
	    system in which the user will start when logging on to the
	    system.  A common convention is to put all user home directories
	    under
	    <filename>/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>
	    or <filename>/usr/home/<replaceable>username</replaceable></filename>.
	    The user would store their personal files in their home directory,
	    and any directories they may create in there.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>User shell</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The shell provides the default environment users use to
	    interact with the system.  There are many different kinds of
	    shells, and experienced users will have their own preferences,
	    which can be reflected in their account settings.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>There are three main types of accounts: the <link
	linkend="users-superuser">Superuser</link>, <link
	linkend="users-system">system users</link>, and <link
	linkend="users-user">user accounts</link>.  The Superuser
      account, usually called <username>root</username>, is used to
      manage the system with no limitations on privileges.  System
      users run services.  Finally, user accounts are used by real
      people, who log on, read mail, and so forth.</para>
  </sect1>
    
  <sect1 id="users-superuser">
    <title>The Superuser Account</title>
    
    <indexterm>
      <primary>accounts</primary>
      <secondary>superuser (root)</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>The superuser account, usually called
      <username>root</username>, comes preconfigured to facilitate
      system administration, and should not be used for day-to-day
      tasks like sending and receiving mail, general exploration of
      the system, or programming.</para>
      
    <para>This is because the superuser, unlike normal user accounts,
      can operate without limits, and misuse of the superuser account
      may result in spectacular disasters.  User accounts are unable
      to destroy the system by mistake, so it is generally best to use
      normal user accounts whenever possible, unless you especially
      need the extra privilege.</para>

    <para>You should always double and triple-check commands you issue
      as the superuser, since an extra space or missing character can
      mean irreparable data loss.</para>

    <para>So, the first thing you should do after reading this
      chapter is to create an unprivileged user account for yourself
      for general usage if you have not already.  This applies equally
      whether you are running a multi-user or single-user machine.
      Later in this chapter, we discuss how to create additional
      accounts, and how to change between the normal user and
      superuser.</para>

      <secondary>system</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>System users are those used to run services such as DNS,
      mail, web servers, and so forth.  The reason for this is
      security; if all services ran as the superuser, they could
      act without restriction.</para>

    <para>Examples of system users are <username>daemon</username>,
      <username>operator</username>, <username>bind</username> (for
      the Domain Name Service), and <username>news</username>.  Often
      sysadmins create <username>httpd</username> to run web servers
      they install.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>accounts</primary>
      <secondary><username>nobody</username></secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para><username>nobody</username> is the generic unprivileged
      system user.  However, it is important to keep in mind that the
      more services that use <username>nobody</username>, the more
      files and processes that user will become associated with, and
      hence the more privileged that user becomes.</para>

    </indexterm>
    <para>User accounts are the primary means of access for real
      people to the system, and these accounts insulate the user and
      the environment, preventing the users from damaging the system
      or other users, and allowing users to customize their
      environment without affecting others.</para>

    <para>Every person accessing your system should have a unique user
      account.  This allows you to find out who is doing what, prevent
      people from clobbering each others' settings or reading each
      others' mail, and so forth.</para>

    <para>Each user can set up their own environment to accommodate
      their use of the system, by using alternate shells, editors, key
      bindings, and language.</para>

      <para>&man.adduser.8; is a simple program for
	adding new users.  It creates entries in the system
	<filename>passwd</filename> and <filename>group</filename>
	files.  It will also create a home directory for the new user,
	copy in the default configuration files (<quote>dotfiles</quote>) from
	<filename>/usr/share/skel</filename>, and can optionally mail
	the new user a welcome message.</para>

      <para>In &os;&nbsp;5.0, &man.adduser.8; was rewritten from a
	Perl script to a shell script that acts as wrapper around
	&man.pw.8;, so its usage is slightly different on &os;&nbsp;4.X
	and &os;&nbsp;5.X.</para>

      <para>To create the initial configuration file, use
	<command>adduser -s -config_create</command>.
	<footnote>
	  <para>The <option>-s</option> makes &man.adduser.8;
	    default to
	    quiet.  We use <option>-v</option> later when we want to
	    change defaults.</para>
	</footnote>
	Next, we configure &man.adduser.8;
	defaults, and create our first user account, since using
	<username>root</username> for normal usage is evil and
	nasty.</para>

    </indexterm>
    <para>If you have users, the ability to limit their system use may
      have come to mind.  FreeBSD provides
      several ways an administrator can limit the amount of system
      resources an individual may use.  These limits are
      divided into two sections: disk quotas, and other resource
      limits.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>quotas</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>limiting users</primary>
      <secondary>quotas</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>disk quotas</primary></indexterm>
    <para>Disk quotas limit disk usage to users, and
      they
      provide a way to quickly check that usage without
      calculating it every time.  Quotas are discussed in <xref
      linkend="quotas">.</para>

    <para>The other resource limits include ways to limit the amount of
      CPU, memory, and other resources a user may consume.  These are
      defined using login classes and are discussed here.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><filename>/etc/login.conf</filename></primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>Login classes are defined in
      <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>.  The precise semantics are
      beyond the scope of this section, but are described in detail in the
      &man.login.conf.5; manual page.  It is sufficient to say that each
      user is assigned to a login class (<literal>default</literal> by
      default), and that each login class has a set of login capabilities
      associated with it.  A login capability is a
      <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>
      pair, where <replaceable>name</replaceable> is a well-known
      identifier and <replaceable>value</replaceable> is an arbitrary
      string processed accordingly depending on the name.  Setting up login
      classes and capabilities is rather straight-forward and is also
      described in &man.login.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>Resource limits are different from plain vanilla login
      capabilities in two ways.  First, for every limit, there is a soft
      (current) and hard limit.  A soft limit may be adjusted by the user
      or application, but may be no higher than the hard limit.  The latter
      may be lowered by the user, but never raised.  Second, most resource
      limits apply per process to a specific user, not the user as a whole.
      Note, however, that these differences are mandated by the specific
      handling of the limits, not by the implementation of the login
      capability framework (i.e., they are not <emphasis>really</emphasis>
      a special case of login capabilities).</para>

    <para>And so, without further ado, below are the most commonly used
      resource limits (the rest, along with all the other login
      capabilities, may be found in &man.login.conf.5;).</para>

	  <para>The limit on the size of a core file generated by a program
	  is, for obvious reasons, subordinate to other limits on disk
	  usage (e.g., <literal>filesize</literal>, or disk quotas).
	  Nevertheless, it is often used as a less-severe method of
	  controlling disk space consumption: since users do not generate
	  core files themselves, and often do not delete them, setting this
	  may save them from running out of disk space should a large
	  program (e.g., <application>emacs</application>) crash.</para>

        <para>Processes started at system startup by

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Although the <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> that comes
          with the system is a good source of reasonable values for most
          limits, only you, the administrator, can know what is appropriate
          for your system.  Setting a limit too high may open your system
          up to abuse, while setting it too low may put a strain on
          productivity.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Users of the X Window System (X11) should probably be granted
	  more resources than other users.  X11 by itself takes a lot of
	  resources, but it also encourages users to run more programs
	  simultaneously.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remember that many limits apply to individual processes, not
          the user as a whole.  For example, setting 
	  <varname>openfiles</varname> to 50 means
          that each process the user runs may open up to 50 files.  Thus,
          the gross amount of files a user may open is the value of
          <literal>openfiles</literal> multiplied by the value of
          <literal>maxproc</literal>.  This also applies to memory
          consumption.</para>

    <para>Localization is an environment set up by the system
      administrator or user to accommodate different languages,
      character sets, date and time standards, and so on.  This is

    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>accounts</primary>
      <secondary>groups</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>A group is simply a list of users.  Groups are identified by
      their group name and GID (Group ID).  In FreeBSD (and most other &unix; like
      systems), the two factors the kernel uses to decide whether a process
      is allowed to do something is its user ID and list of groups it
      belongs to.  Unlike a user ID, a process has a list of groups
      associated with it.  You may hear some things refer to the <quote>group ID</quote>
      of a user or process; most of the time, this just means the first
      group in the list.</para>

    <para>The group name to group ID map is in
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>.  This is a plain text file with four
      colon-delimited fields.  The first field is the group name, the
      second is the encrypted password, the third the group ID, and the
      fourth the comma-delimited list of members.  It can safely be edited
      by hand (assuming, of course, that you do not make any syntax
      errors!).  For a more complete description of the syntax, see the
      &man.group.5; manual page.</para>

    <para>If you do not want to edit <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      manually, you can use the &man.pw.8; command to add and edit groups.
      For example, to add a group called <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> and
      then confirm that it exists you can use:</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupadd teamtwo</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The number <literal>1100</literal> above is the group ID of the
      group <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.  Right now,
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> has no members, and is thus rather
      useless.  Let's change that by inviting <username>jru</username> to
      the <groupname>teamtwo</groupname> group.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Adding Somebody to a Group Using &man.pw.8;</title>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupmod teamtwo -M jru</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pw groupshow teamtwo</userinput>
teamtwo:*:1100:jru</screen>
    </example>

    <para>The argument to the <option>-M</option> option is a
      comma-delimited list of users who are members of the group.  From the
      preceding sections, we know that the password file also contains a
      group for each user.  The latter (the user) is automatically added to
      the group list by the system; the user will not show up as a member
      when using the <option>groupshow</option> command to &man.pw.8;,
      but will show up when the information is queried via &man.id.1; or
      similar tool.  In other words, &man.pw.8; only manipulates the
      <filename>/etc/group</filename> file; it will never attempt to read
      additionally data from <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using &man.id.1; to Determine Group Membership</title>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>id jru</userinput>
uid=1001(jru) gid=1001(jru) groups=1001(jru), 1100(teamtwo)</screen>
    </example>

    <para>As you can see, <username>jru</username> is a member of the
      groups <groupname>jru</groupname> and
      <groupname>teamtwo</groupname>.</para>

    <para>For more information about &man.pw.8;, see its manual page, and
      for more information on the format of
      <filename>/etc/group</filename>, consult the &man.group.5; manual
      page.</para>
