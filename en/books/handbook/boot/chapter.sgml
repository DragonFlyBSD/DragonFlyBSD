    <para>The process of starting a computer and loading the operating system
      is referred to as <quote>the bootstrap process</quote>, or simply
      <quote>booting</quote>.  FreeBSD's boot process provides a great deal of
      flexibility in customizing what happens when you start the system,
      allowing you to select from different operating systems installed on the
      same computer, or even different versions of the same operating system
      or installed kernel.</para>

    <para>This chapter details the configuration options you can set and how
      to customize the FreeBSD boot process.  This includes everything that
      happens until the FreeBSD kernel has started, probed for devices, and
      started &man.init.8;.  If you are not quite sure when this happens, it
      occurs when the text color changes from bright white to grey.</para>

    <title>The Booting Problem</title>

    <para>Turning on a computer and starting the operating system poses an
      interesting dilemma.  By definition, the computer does not know how to
      do anything until the operating system is started.  This includes
      running programs from the disk.  So if the computer can not run a
      program from the disk without the operating system, and the operating
      system programs are on the disk, how is the operating system
      started?</para>

    <para>This problem parallels one in the book <citetitle>The Adventures of
      Baron Munchausen</citetitle>.  A character had fallen part way down a
      manhole, and pulled himself out by grabbing his bootstraps, and
      lifting.  In the early days of computing the term
      <firstterm>bootstrap</firstterm> was applied to the mechanism used to
      load the operating system, which has become shortened to
      <quote>booting</quote>.</para>

    <para>On x86 hardware the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is responsible
      for loading the operating system.  To do this, the BIOS looks on the
      hard disk for the Master Boot Record (MBR), which must be located on a
      specific place on the disk.  The BIOS has enough knowledge to load and
      run the MBR, and assumes that the MBR can then carry out the rest of the
      tasks involved in loading the operating system.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>BIOS</primary>
      <secondary>Basic Input/Output System</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>If you only have one operating system installed on your disks then
      the standard MBR will suffice.  This MBR searches for the first bootable
      slice on the disk, and then runs the code on that slice to load the
      remainder of the operating system.</para>

    <para>If you have installed multiple operating systems on your disks then
      you can install a different MBR, one that can display a list of
      different operating systems, and allows you to choose the one to boot
      from.  FreeBSD comes with one such MBR which can be installed, and other
      operating system vendors also provide alternative MBRs.</para>

    <para>The remainder of the FreeBSD bootstrap system is divided into three
      stages.  The first stage is run by the MBR, which knows just enough to
      get the computer into a specific state and run the second stage.  The
      second stage can do a little bit more, before running the third stage.
      The third stage finishes the task of loading the operating system.  The
      work is split into these three stages because the PC standards put
      limits on the size of the programs that can be run at stages one and
      two.  Chaining the tasks together allows FreeBSD to provide a more
      flexible loader.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>kernel</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary><command>init</command></primary></indexterm>

    <para>The kernel is then started and it begins to probe for devices
      and initialize them for use.  Once the kernel boot
      process is finished, the kernel passes control to the user process
      &man.init.8;, which then makes sure the disks are in a usable state.
      &man.init.8; then starts the user-level resource configuration which
      mounts file systems, sets up network cards to communicate on the
      network, and generally starts all the processes that usually
      are run on a FreeBSD system at startup.</para>

    <title>The MBR, and Boot Stages One, Two, and Three</title>

    <sect2 id="boot-boot0">
      <title>MBR, <filename>/boot/boot0</filename></title>
      <indexterm><primary>Master Boot Record (MBR)</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The FreeBSD MBR is located in <filename>/boot/boot0</filename>.
	This is a <emphasis>copy</emphasis> of the MBR, as the real MBR must
	be placed on a special part of the disk, outside the FreeBSD
	area.</para>

      <para><filename>boot0</filename> is very simple, since the
	program in the <abbrev>MBR</abbrev> can only be 512 bytes in
	size.  If you have installed the FreeBSD MBR and have installed
	multiple operating systems on your hard disks then you will see a
	display similar to this one at boot time:</para>

      <example id="boot-boot0-example">
	<title><filename>boot0</filename> Screenshot</title>

	<screen>F1 DOS
F2 FreeBSD
F3 Linux
F4 ??
F5 Drive 1

Default: F2</screen>
      </example>

      <para>Other operating systems, in particular &windows;&nbsp;95, have been known
	to overwrite an existing MBR with their own.  If this happens to you,
	or you want to replace your existing MBR with the FreeBSD MBR then use
	the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdisk -B -b /boot/boot0 <replaceable>device</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Where <replaceable>device</replaceable> is the device that you
	boot from, such as <devicename>ad0</devicename> for the first IDE
	disk, <devicename>ad2</devicename> for the first IDE disk on a second
	IDE controller, <devicename>da0</devicename> for the first SCSI disk,
	and so on.</para>

      <para>If you are a Linux user, however, and prefer that
	<application>LILO</application> control the boot process, you can
	edit the <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename> file for FreeBSD, or
	select <option>Leave The Master Boot Record Untouched</option>
	during the FreeBSD installation process.  If you have installed the
	FreeBSD boot manager, you can boot back into Linux and modify the
	<application>LILO</application> configuration file
	<filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename> and add the following
	option:</para>

      <programlisting>other=/dev/hdXY
table=/dev/hdb
loader=/boot/chain.b
label=FreeBSD</programlisting>

      <para>which will permit the booting of FreeBSD and Linux via
	<application>LILO</application>.  In our example, we use
	<replaceable>XY</replaceable> to determine drive number and
	partition.  If you are using a <acronym>SCSI</acronym> drive, you
	will want to change <replaceable>/dev/hdXY</replaceable> to read
	something similar to <replaceable>/dev/sdXY</replaceable>, which
	again uses the <replaceable>XY</replaceable> syntax.  The
	<option>loader=/boot/chain.b</option> can be omitted if you have
	both operating systems on the same drive.  You can now run
	<command>/sbin/lilo -v</command> to commit your new changes to the
	system, this should be verified with screen messages.</para>

    <sect2 id="boot-boot1">
      <title>Stage One, <filename>/boot/boot1</filename>, and Stage Two,
	<filename>/boot/boot2</filename></title>
      
      <para>Conceptually the first and second stages are part of the same
	program, on the same area of the disk.  Because of space constraints
	they have been split into two, but you would always install them
	together.</para>

      <para>They are found on the boot sector of
	the boot slice, which is where <link
	  linkend="boot-boot0">boot0</link>, or any other program on the
	<abbrev>MBR</abbrev> expects to find the program to run to
	continue the boot process.  The files in the
	<filename>/boot</filename> directory are copies of the real files,
	which are stored outside of the FreeBSD file system.</para>

      <para><filename>boot1</filename> is very simple, since it too 
	can only be 512 bytes
	in size, and knows just enough about the FreeBSD
	<firstterm>disklabel</firstterm>, which stores information
	about the slice, to find and execute <filename>boot2</filename>.</para>
      
      <para><filename>boot2</filename> is slightly more sophisticated, and understands
	the FreeBSD file system enough to find files on it, and can
	provide a simple interface to choose the kernel or loader to
	run.</para>

      <para>Since the <link linkend="boot-loader">loader</link> is
	much more sophisticated, and provides a nice easy-to-use
	boot configuration, <filename>boot2</filename> usually runs
	it, but previously it
	was tasked to run the kernel directly.</para>

      <para>If you ever need to replace the installed

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -B <replaceable>diskslice</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>where <replaceable>diskslice</replaceable> is the disk and slice

	<title>Dangerously Dedicated Mode</title>

	<para>If you use just the disk name, such as
	  <devicename>ad0</devicename>, in the &man.disklabel.8; command you
	  will create a dangerously dedicated disk, without slices.  This is
	  almost certainly not what you want to do, so make sure you double

  <sect2 id="boot-loader">
    <title>Stage Three, <filename>/boot/loader</filename></title>

    <indexterm><primary>boot-loader</primary></indexterm>
    <para>The loader is the final stage of the three-stage
      bootstrap, and is located on the file system, usually as
      <filename>/boot/loader</filename>.</para>
      
    <para>The loader is intended as a user-friendly method for
      configuration, using an easy-to-use built-in command set,
      backed up by a more powerful interpreter, with a more complex
      command set.</para> 

    <sect3 id="boot-loader-flow">
      <title>Loader Program Flow</title>
      
      <para>During initialization, the loader will probe for a
	console and for disks, and figure out what disk it is
	booting from.  It will set variables accordingly, and an
	interpreter is started where user commands can be passed from
	a script or interactively.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>loader</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>loader configuration</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The loader will then read
	<filename>/boot/loader.rc</filename>, which by default reads
	in <filename>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</filename> which
	sets reasonable defaults for variables and reads
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> for local changes to
	those variables.  <filename>loader.rc</filename> then acts
	on these variables, loading whichever modules and kernel are
	selected.</para>

      <para>Finally, by default, the loader issues a 10 second wait
	for key presses, and boots the kernel if it is not interrupted.
	If interrupted, the user is presented with a prompt which
	understands the easy-to-use command set, where the user may
	adjust variables, unload all modules, load modules, and then
	finally boot or reboot.</para>

    <note><para>This is a FreeBSD&nbsp;5.0 and later feature which does not
      exist in earlier versions.</para></note>

    <para>During initial system startup, the boot &man.loader.8; will read the
      &man.device.hints.5; file.  This file stores kernel boot information
      known as variables, sometimes referred to as <quote>device hints</quote>.
      These <quote>device hints</quote> are used by device drivers for device
      configuration.</para>
      
    <para>Device hints may also be specified at the <link linkend="boot-loader">
      Stage 3 boot loader</link> prompt.  Variables can be added using
      <command>set</command>, removed with <command>unset</command>, and viewed
      with the <command>show</command> commands.  Variables set in the
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file can be overridden here also.  Device hints entered at
      the boot loader are not permanent and will be forgotten on the next
      reboot.</para>

    <para>Once the system is booted, the &man.kenv.1; command can be used to
      dump all of the variables.</para>

    <para>The syntax for the <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename> file is one variable per line, using
      the standard hash <quote>#</quote> as comment markers.  Lines are
      constructed as follows:</para>

    <screen><userinput>hint.driver.unit.keyword="<replaceable>value</replaceable>"</userinput></screen>

    <para><literal>driver</literal> is the device driver name, <literal>unit</literal>
      is the device driver unit number, and <literal>keyword</literal> is the hint

    <para>To power down a FreeBSD machine on architectures and systems
      that support power management, simply use the command
      <command>shutdown -p now</command> to turn the power off
      immediately.  To just reboot a FreeBSD system, just use
      <command>shutdown -r now</command>.  You need to be
      <username>root</username> or a member of
      <groupname>operator</groupname> group to run &man.shutdown.8;.
      The &man.halt.8; and &man.reboot.8; commands can also be used,
      please refer to their manual pages and to &man.shutdown.8;'s one
      for more informations.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Power management requires &man.acpi.4; support in the kernel
	or loaded as module for FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X and &man.apm.4;
	support for FreeBSD&nbsp;4.X.</para>
