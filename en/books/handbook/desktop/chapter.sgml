  <title>Desktop Applications</title>

  <sect1 id="desktop-synopsis">
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>&os; can run a wide variety of desktop applications, such
      as browsers and word processors.  Most of these are available as
      packages or can be automatically built from the ports
      collection.  Many new users expect to find these kinds of
      applications on their desktop.  This chapter will show you how
      to install some popular desktop applications effortlessly,
      either from their packages or from the ports collection.</para>

    <para>Note that when installing programs from the ports, they are
      compiled from source.  This can take a very long time, depending
      on what you are compiling and the processing power of your
      machine(s).  If building from source takes a prohibitively long
      amount of time for you, you can install most of the programs of
      the ports collection from pre-built packages.</para>

    <para>As &os; features Linux binary compatibility, many
      applications originally developed for Linux are available for
      your desktop.  It is strongly recommended that you read
      <xref linkend="linuxemu"> before installing any of the Linux
      applications.  Many of the ports using the Linux binary
      compatibility start with <quote>linux-</quote>.  Remember this
      when you search for a particular port, for instance with
      &man.whereis.1;.  In the following text, it is assumed that you
      have enabled Linux binary compatibility before installing any of
      the Linux applications.</para>

    <para>Here are the categories covered by this chapter:</para>

  <sect1 id="desktop-browsers">
    <title>Browsers</title>

    <para>&os; does not come with a particular browser
      pre-installed.  Instead, the
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/www.html">www</ulink>
      directory of the ports collection contains a lot of browsers
      ready to be installed.  If you do not have time to compile
      everything (this can take a very long time in some cases) many
      of them are available as packages.</para>

    <para><application>KDE</application> and
      <application>GNOME</application> already provide HTML browsers.
      Please refer to <xref linkend="x11-wm"> for more information on
      how to set up these complete desktops.</para>

    <para>If you are looking for light-weight browsers, you should
      investigate the ports collection for

      <title>Mozilla</title>
      <indexterm>
	<primary><application>Mozilla</application></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para><application>Mozilla</application> is perhaps the most
        suitable browser for your &os; Desktop.  It is modern and
        stable.  It features a very
        standards-compliant HTML display engine.  It provides a mail
        and news reader.  It even has a HTML composer if you plan to
        write some web pages yourself.  Users of
        <application>&netscape;</application> will recognize the
        similarities with <application>Communicator</application>
        suite, as both browsers shared the same basis.</para>

      <para>On slow machines, with a CPU speed less than 233MHz or
        with less than 64MB of RAM, <application>Mozilla</application>
        can be too resource-consuming to be fully usable.  You may
        want to look at the <application>Opera</application> browser
        instead, described a little later in this chapter.</para>

      <para>The Mozilla package from the network by:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r mozilla</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the package is not available, and you have enough time
        and disk space, you can get the source for
        <application>Mozilla</application>, compile it and install it
        on your system.  This is accomplished by:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/www/mozilla</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>The <application>Mozilla</application> port ensures a
        correct initialization by running the chrome registry setup
        with <username>root</username> privileges.  However, if you
        want to fetch some add-ons like mouse gestures, you must run
        <application>Mozilla</application> as
        <username>root</username> to get them properly
        installed.</para>

      <para>Once you have completed the installation of
        <application>Mozilla</application>, you do not need to be
        <username>root</username> any longer.  You can start
        <application>Mozilla</application> as a browser by typing:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mozilla</userinput></screen>

      <para>You can start it directly as a mail and news reader as
        shown below:</para>

      <title>Mozilla, &java;, and &macromedia; &flash;</title>
      
      <para>Installing <application>Mozilla</application> is simple, but
	unfortunately installing <application>Mozilla</application> with
	support for add-ons like &java; and
	&macromedia; &flash;
	consumes both time and disk
	space.</para>

      <para>The first thing is to download the files which will be used
	with <application>Mozilla</application>.  Take your current web
	browser up to
	<ulink url="http://www.sun.com/software/java2/download.html"></ulink> and
	create an account on their website.  Remember to save the username
	and password from here as it may be needed in the future.  Download
	a copy of the file <filename>j2sdk-1_3_1-src.tar.gz</filename> and place this in
	<filename>/usr/ports/distfiles/</filename> as the port will not
	fetch it automatically.  This is due to license restrictions.  While
	we are here, download the <quote>java environment</quote> from
	<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/webapps/download/Display?BundleId=7905"></ulink>.
	The filename is <filename>j2sdk-1_3_1_08-linux-i586.bin</filename> and is large (about 25
	megabytes!).  Like before, this file must be placed into
	<filename>/usr/ports/distfiles/</filename>.  Finally download a copy
	of the <quote>java patchkit</quote> from
	<ulink url="http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/"></ulink>
	and place it
	into <filename>/usr/ports/distfiles/</filename>.</para>
      
      <para>Install the <filename role="package">java/jdk13</filename> port
	with the standard <command>make install clean</command> and
	then install the <filename role="package">www/flashpluginwrapper</filename>
	port.  This port requires
	<filename role="package">emulators/linux_base</filename> which is a
	large port.  True that other <application>&flash;</application> plugins exist, however they have
	not worked for me.</para>

      <para>Install the <filename role="package">www/mozilla</filename> port,
	if <application>Mozilla</application> is not already installed.</para>

      <para>Now copy the <application>&flash;</application> plug-in files with:</para>
    
      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp /usr/local/lib/flash/libflashplayer.so \
	/usr/X11R6/lib/browser_plugins/libflashplayer_linux.so</userinput></screen>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp /usr/local/lib/flash/ShockwaveFlash.class \
	/usr/X11R6/lib/browser_plugins/</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now add the following lines to the top of (but right under
      <literal>#!/bin/sh</literal>) <application>Mozilla</application> startup script:
      <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin/mozilla</filename>.</para>

<programlisting>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libflashplayer.so.1
export LD_PRELOAD</programlisting>

      <para>This will enable the <application>&flash;</application> plug-in.</para>

      <para>Now just start <application>Mozilla</application> with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mozilla &amp;</userinput></screen>

      <para>And access the <guimenuitem>About Plug-ins</guimenuitem> option from the
	<guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu.  A list should appear with all the currently
	available plugins.  <application>&java;</application> and
	<application>&shockwave; &flash;</application> should both be listed.</para>
    
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>&netscape;</title>
      <indexterm>
	<primary><application>Netscape</application></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>The ports collection contains several versions of the
        &netscape; browser.  Since the native FreeBSD ones contain a
        serious security bug, installing them is strongly
        discouraged.  Instead, use a more recent Linux or DIGITAL UNIX
        version.</para>

      <para>The latest stable release of the &netscape; browser is
        <application>&netscape; 7</application>.  It can be installed
        from the ports collection:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/www/netscape7</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>There are localized versions in the French, German, and
        Japanese categories.</para>

      <caution>
        <para><application>&netscape; 4.x</application> versions are not
          recommended because they are not compliant with today's
          standards.  However, <application>&netscape; 7.x</application>
          and newer versions are only available for the &i386;
          platform.</para>
      </caution>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Opera</title>
      <indexterm>
	<primary><application>Opera</application></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para><application>Opera</application> is a very fast,
        full-featured, and standards-compliant browser.  It comes in
        two favors: a FreeBSD version and a
        version that runs under Linux emulation.
	For each operating system, there is a no-cost version of the
        browser that displays advertising and an ad-free 
        version that can be purchased on the <ulink
        url="http://www.opera.com/">Opera web site</ulink>.</para>

      <para>To browse the Web with the FreeBSD version of <application>Opera</application>,
        install the package:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r opera</userinput></screen>

      <para>Some FTP sites do not have all the packages, but the same
        result can be obtained with the ports collection by
        typing:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/www/opera</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>To install the Linux version of
	<application>Opera</application>, substitute
	<literal>linux-opera</literal> in place of
	<literal>opera</literal> in the examples above.  The Linux
	version is useful in situations requiring the use of plug-ins
	that are only available for Linux, such as <application>Adobe
	&acrobat.reader;</application>.  In all other respects, the
	&os; and Linux versions appear to be functionally
	identical.</para>

    <title>Productivity</title>

    <para>When it comes to productivity, new users often look for a
       good office suite or a friendly word processor.  While some
       <link linkend="x11-wm">desktop environments</link> like

      <para><application>OpenOffice.org</application> includes all of the
        mandatory applications in a complete office productivity
        suite: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation manager,
        and a drawing program.  Its user interface is very similar
        to other office suites, and it can import and export in various
        popular file formats.  It is available in a number of
        different languages including interfaces, spell checkers, and
        dictionaries.</para>

      <para>The word processor of
        <application>OpenOffice.org</application> uses a native XML
        file format for increased portability and flexibility.  The
        spreadsheet program features a macro language and it can be
        interfaced with external databases.
        <application>OpenOffice.org</application> is already stable
        and runs natively on &windows;, &solaris;, Linux, FreeBSD,
        and &macos;&nbsp;X.  More
        information about <application>OpenOffice.org</application>
        can be found on the
	<ulink url="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice web site</ulink>.
	For FreeBSD specific information, and to directly
	download packages use the <ulink
	url="http://projects.imp.ch/openoffice/">FreeBSD OpenOffice
	Porting Team</ulink>'s web site.  These packages should work 
	on &os;.</para>

      <para>To install <application>OpenOffice.org</application>,
        do:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r openoffice</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once the package is installed, you must run the setup
        program and choose a <option>standard workstation installation</option>.
        Run this command as the user who will use
        <application>OpenOffice.org</application>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>openoffice-setup</userinput></screen>

      <para>If the <application>OpenOffice.org</application> packages
        are not available, you still have the option to compile the
        port.  However, you must bear in mind that it requires a lot of
        disk space and a fairly long time to compile.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once this is done, run the setup as the user who will use
        <application>OpenOffice.org</application> and choose a
        <option>standard workstation installation</option> by:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make install-user</userinput></screen>

    <para>&os; is quite ready for day-to-day use as a desktop.
      With several thousand applications available as
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/where.html">packages</ulink> or
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/index.html">ports</ulink>,
      you can build a perfect desktop that suits all your needs.</para>

    <para>Once you have achieved the installation of your desktop, you
      may want to go one step further with
      <filename role="package">misc/instant-workstation</filename>.
      This <quote>meta-port</quote> allows you to build a typical set
      of ports for a workstation.  You can customize it by editing
      <filename>/usr/ports/misc/instant-workstation/Makefile</filename>.
      Follow the syntax used for the default set to add or remove
      ports, and build it with the usual procedure.
      Eventually, you will be able to create a big package that
      corresponds to your very own desktop and install it to your
      other workstations!</para>
