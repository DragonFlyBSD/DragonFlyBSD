  <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>FreeBSD supports a wide variety of sound cards, allowing you
      to enjoy high fidelity output from your computer.  This includes
      the ability to record and playback audio in the MPEG Audio Layer
      3 (MP3), WAV, and Ogg Vorbis formats as well as many other
      formats.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection also contains
      applications allowing you to edit your recorded audio, add sound
      effects, and control attached MIDI devices.</para>

    <para>With some willingness to experiment, FreeBSD can support
      playback of video files and DVD's.  The number of applications
      to encode, convert, and playback various video media is more
      limited than the number of sound applications.  For example as
      of this writing, there is no good re-encoding application in the
      FreeBSD Ports Collection, which could be use to convert
      between formats, as there is with <filename
      role="package">audio/sox</filename>.  However, the software
      landscape in this area is changing rapidly.</para>

    <para>This chapter will describe the necessary steps to configure
      your sound card.  The configuration and installation of <application>&xfree86;</application>
      (<xref linkend="x11">) has already taken care of the
      hardware issues for your video card, though there may be some
      tweaks to apply for better playback.</para>

    <para>To use your sound device, you will need to load the proper
      device driver.  This may be accomplished in one of two ways.
      The easiest way is to simply load a kernel module for your sound
      card with &man.kldload.8; which can either be done from the
      command line:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kldload snd_emu10k1.ko</userinput></screen>
    <para>or by adding the appropriate line to the file
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> like this:</para>

    <programlisting>snd_emu10k1_load="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>These examples are for a Creative &soundblaster; Live! sound
      card.  Other available loadable sound modules are listed in
      <filename>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, you may statically
      compile in support for your sound card in your kernel.  The
      sections below provide the information you need to add support
      for your hardware in this manner.  For more information about
      recompiling your kernel, please see <xref
      linkend="kernelconfig">.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Creative, Advance, and ESS Sound Cards</title>

      <para>If you have one of the above cards, you will need to
	add:</para>
	
      <programlisting>device pcm</programlisting>

      <para>to your kernel configuration file.  If you have a PnP ISA
	card, you will also need to add:</para>

      <programlisting>device sbc</programlisting>

      <para>For a non-PnP ISA card, add:</para>

      <programlisting>device pcm
device sbc0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 flags 0x15</programlisting>

      <para>to your kernel configuration file.  The settings shown

      <note>
	<para>The Sound Blaster Live is not supported under FreeBSD&nbsp;4.0
	  without a patch, which this section will not cover.  It is

    <title>Utilizing Multiple Sound Sources</title>

    <para>It is often desirable to have multiple sources of sound that
      are able to play simultaneously, such as when
      <application>esound</application> or
      <application>artsd</application> do not support sharing of the
      sound device with a certain application.</para>

    <para>FreeBSD lets you do this through <emphasis>Virtual Sound
      Channels</emphasis>, which can be set with the &man.sysctl.8;
      facility.  Virtual channels allow you to multiplex your sound
      card's playback channels by mixing sound in the kernel.</para>

    <para>To set the number of virtual channels, there are two sysctl
      knobs which, if you are the <username>root</username> user, can
      be set like this:</para>
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.snd.pcm0.vchans=4</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.snd.maxautovchans=4</userinput></screen>

    <para>The above example allocates four virtual channels, which is a
      practical number for everyday use.  <varname>hw.snd.pcm0.vchans</varname>
      is the number of virtual channels <devicename>pcm0</devicename> has, and is configurable
      once a device has been attached.
      <literal>hw.snd.maxautovchans</literal> is the number of virtual channels
      a new audio device is given when it is attached using
      &man.kldload.8;.  Since the <devicename>pcm</devicename> module
      can be loaded independently of the hardware drivers,
      <varname>hw.snd.maxautovchans</varname> can store how many
      virtual channels any devices which are attached later will be
      given.</para>

    <para>If you are not using &man.devfs.5;, you will have to point
      your applications at <devicename>/dev/dsp0</devicename>.<replaceable>x</replaceable>, where
      <replaceable>x</replaceable> is 0 to 3 if <varname>hw.snd.pcm.0.vchans</varname> is set
      to 4 as in the above example.  On a system using &man.devfs.5;, the above will automatically be
      allocated transparently to the user.</para>

  <title>Video Playback</title>

    <para>Video playback is a very new and rapidly developing application
      area.  Be patient.  Not everything is going to work as smoothly as
      it did with sound.</para>

    <para>Before you begin, you should know the model of the video
      card you have and the chip it uses.  While <application>&xfree86;</application> supports a
      wide variety of video cards, fewer give good playback
      performance.  To obtain a list of extensions supported by the
      X server using your card use the command &man.xdpyinfo.1; while
      X11 is running.</para>

    <para>It is a good idea to have a short MPEG file which can be
      treated as a test file for evaluating various players and
      options.  Since some DVD players will look for DVD media in
      <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> by default, or have this device
      name hardcoded in them, you might find it useful to make
      symbolic links to the proper devices:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0c /dev/dvd</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/racd0c /dev/rdvd</userinput></screen>

    <para>On FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X, which uses &man.devfs.5; there
        is a slightly different set of recommended links:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0 /dev/dvd</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -sf /dev/acd0 /dev/rdvd</userinput></screen>

    <para>Note that due to the nature of &man.devfs.5;,
      manually created links like these will not persist if you reboot
      your system.  In order to create the symbolic links
      automatically whenever you boot your system, add the following
      lines to <filename>/etc/devfs.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>link acd0 dvd
link acd0 rdvd</programlisting>

    <para>Additionally, DVD decryption, which requires invoking
      special DVD-ROM functions, requires write permission on the DVD
      devices.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel options</primary>
      <secondary>options CPU_ENABLE_SSE</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel options</primary>
      <secondary>options USER_LDT</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Some of the ports discussed rely on the following kernel
      options to build correctly.  Before attempting to build, add
      these options to the kernel configuration file, build a new kernel, and reboot:</para>

      <programlisting>option CPU_ENABLE_SSE
option USER_LDT</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para><literal>option USER_LDT</literal> does not exist on
	&os;&nbsp;5.X.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To enhance the shared memory X11 interface, it is
      recommended that the values of some &man.sysctl.8; variables
      should be increased:</para>

    <para>This section discusses the software available from the
      FreeBSD Ports Collection which can be used for video playback.
      Video playback is a very active area of software development,
      and the capabilities of various applications are bound to
      diverge somewhat from the descriptions given here.</para>

    <para>Firstly, it is important to know that many of the video
      applications which run on FreeBSD were developed as Linux
      applications.  Many of these applications are still
      beta-quality.  Some of the problems that you may encounter with
      video packages on FreeBSD include:</para>

      <orderedlist>

        <para>An application cannot playback a file which another
          application produced.</para>

        <para>The same application on two different machines,
          rebuilt on each machine for that machine, plays back the same
          file differently.</para>

        <para>A seemingly trivial filter like rescaling of the image
          size results in very bad artifacts from a buggy rescaling

        <para>An application frequently dumps core.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Documentation is not installed with the port and can be

      </listitem>

      </orderedlist>

    <para>Many of these applications may also exhibit
      <quote>Linux-isms</quote>.  That is, there may be
      issues resulting from the way some standard libraries are
      implemented in the Linux distributions, or some features of the
      Linux kernel which have been assumed by the authors of the
      applications.  These issues are not always noticed and worked around
      by the port maintainers, which can lead to problems like
      these:</para>
       
      <orderedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>The use of <filename>/proc/cpuinfo</filename> to detect

        <para>If you have <filename
          role="package">x11-toolkits/gtk12</filename> installed, then
          you might as well enable the GUI.  Otherwise, it is not
          worth the effort.  If you intend to play (possibly CSS
          encoded) DVD's with <application>MPlayer</application> you must enable the DVD support
          option here <footnote><para>Unauthorized DVD playback is a
          serious criminal act in some countries.  Check local laws

        <para>As of this writing, the <application>MPlayer</application> port will build its HTML
          documentation and one executable,
          <command>mplayer</command>.  It can also be made to build an
          encoder, <command>mencoder</command>, which is a tool for
          re-encoding video.  A modification to the
          <filename>Makefile</filename> can enable it.  It may be
          enabled by default in subsequent versions of the port.</para>

        <para>The HTML documentation for <application>MPlayer</application> is very informative.
          If the reader finds the information on video hardware and
          interfaces in this chapter lacking, the <application>MPlayer</application> documentation
          is a very thorough supplement.  You should definitely take
          the time to read the <application>MPlayer</application>
          documentation if you are looking for information about video
          support in &unix;.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>MPlayer</primary>
	           <secondary>use</secondary></indexterm>

        <para>Any user of <application>MPlayer</application> must set up a
          <filename>.mplayer</filename> subdirectory of her
          home directory.  To create this necessary subdirectory,
	  you can type the following:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mplayer</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>make install-user</userinput></screen>

	<para>The command options for <command>mplayer</command> are
	  listed in the manual page.  For even more detail there is HTML
	  documentation.  In this section, we will describe only a few
	  common uses.</para>

	<para>To play a file, such as
	  <filename><replaceable>testfile.avi</replaceable></filename>,
	  through one of the various video interfaces set the
	  <option>-vo</option> option:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mplayer -vo xv testfile.avi</userinput></screen>
	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mplayer -vo sdl testfile.avi</userinput></screen>
	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mplayer -vo x11 testfile.avi</userinput></screen>
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -vo dga testfile.avi</userinput></screen>
	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -vo 'sdl:dga' testfile.avi</userinput></screen>

	<para>It is worth trying all of these options, as their relative
	  performance depends on many factors and will vary significantly
	  with hardware.</para>

	<para>To play from a DVD, replace the
	 <filename>testfile.avi</filename> with <option>-dvd <replaceable>N</replaceable>
	 <replaceable>DEVICE</replaceable></option> where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is
	 the title number to play and
	 <filename><replaceable>DEVICE</replaceable></filename> is the
	 device node for the DVD-ROM.  For example, to play title 3
	 from <filename>/dev/dvd</filename>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -vo dga -dvd 3 /dev/dvd</userinput></screen>

	<para>To stop, pause, advance and so on, consult the
	  keybindings, which are output by running <command>mplayer
	  -h</command> or read the manual page.</para>

        <para>Additional important options for playback are:
          <option>-fs -zoom</option> which engages the fullscreen mode
          and <option>-framedrop</option> which helps performance.</para>

	<para>In order for the mplayer command line to not become too
	  large, the user can create a file
	  <filename>.mplayer/config</filename> and set default options
	  there:</para>
<programlisting>vo=xv
fs=yes
zoom=yes</programlisting>

	<para>Finally, <command>mplayer</command> can be used to rip a
	  DVD title into a <filename>.vob</filename> file.  To dump
	  out the second title from a DVD, type this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile out.vob -dvd 2 /dev/dvd</userinput></screen>

        <para>The output file, <filename>out.vob</filename>, will be
	  MPEG and can be manipulated by the other packages described
	  in this section.</para>

	<para>If you opt to install <command>mencoder</command> when
	 you build <application>MPlayer</application>, be forewarned
	 that it is still an experimental component.  Before using 
         <command>mencoder</command> it is a good idea to
	 familiarize yourself with the options from the HTML
	 documentation.  There is a manual page, but it is not very
	 useful without the HTML documentation.  There are innumerable ways to
	 improve quality, lower bitrate, and change formats, and some
	 of these tricks may make the difference between good
	 or bad performance.  Here are a couple of examples to get
	 you going.  First a simple copy:</para>

	 <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mencoder input.avi -oac copy -ovc copy -o output.avi</userinput></screen>

         <para>Improper combinations of command line options can yield
	 output files that are
	 unplayable even by <command>mplayer</command>.  Thus, if you
	 just want to rip to a file, stick to the <option>-dumpfile</option>
	 in <command>mplayer</command>.</para>

	 <para>To convert <filename>input.avi</filename> to the MPEG4
	 codec with MPEG3 audio encoding (<filename role="package">audio/lame</filename> is required):</para>

	 <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mencoder input.avi -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=192 \
	 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq -o output.avi</userinput></screen>

	 <para>This has produced output playable by <command>mplayer</command>
	 and <command>xine</command>.</para>

	 <para><filename>input.avi</filename> can be replaced with
	   <option>-dvd 1 /dev/dvd</option> and run as
	   <username>root</username> to re-encode a DVD title
	   directly.  Since you are likely to be dissatisfied with
	   your results the first time around, it is recommended you
	   dump the title to a file and work on the file.</para>

    <sect3 id="video-xine">
    <title>The xine Video Player</title>

    <para>The <application>xine</application> video player is a project of wide scope aiming not only at being an
     all in one video solution, but also in producing a reusable base
     library and a modular executable which can be extended with
     plugins.  It comes both as a package and as a port, <filename
     role="package">multimedia/xine</filename>.</para>

    <para>The <application>xine</application> player
     is still very rough around the edges, but it is clearly off to a
     good start.  In practice, <application>xine</application> requires either a fast CPU with a
     fast video card, or support for the XVideo extension.  The GUI is
     usable, but a bit clumsy.</para>

    <para>As of this writing, there is no input module shipped with
     <application>xine</application> which will play CSS encoded DVD's.  There are third party
     builds which do have modules for this built in them, but none
     of these are in the FreeBSD Ports Collection.</para>

    <para>Compared to <application>MPlayer</application>, <application>xine</application> does more for the user, but at the
      same time, takes some of the more fine-grained control away from
      the user.  The <application>xine</application> video player
      performs best on XVideo interfaces.</para>
     
    <para>By default, <application>xine</application> player will
    start up in a graphical user interface.  The menus can then be
    used to open a specific file:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xine</userinput></screen>

    <para>Alternatively, it may be invoked to play a file immediately
      without the GUI with the command:</para>

      ability to merge video files, repair broken files, using command
      line tools with <filename>stdin/stdout</filename> stream
      interfaces.</para>

    <para>Like <application>MPlayer</application>, <application>transcode</application> is very experimental software which

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make WITH_AVIFILE=yes WITH_LIBMPEG2=yes</userinput></screen>

    <para>Here are two examples of using <command>transcode</command>
      for video conversion which produce rescaled output.  The first
      encodes the output to an openDIVX AVI file, while the second
      encodes to the much more portable MPEG format.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>transcode -i input.vob -x vob -V -Z 320x240 \
-y opendivx -N 0x55 -o output.avi</userinput></screen>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>transcode -i input.vob -x vob -V -Z 320x240 \
-y mpeg -N 0x55 -o output.tmp</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>tcmplex -o output.mpg -i output.tmp.m1v -p output.tmp.mpa -m 1</userinput></screen>

    <para>There is a manual page for <command>transcode</command>, but
      there is little documentation for the various <command>tc*</command> utilities (such as
      <command>tcmplex</command>) which are also installed.
      However, the <option>-h</option> command line option can

      command.</para>

    <para>In comparison, <command>transcode</command> runs
      significantly slower than <command>mencoder</command>, but it
      has a better chance of producing a more widely playable file.

    <para>The various video software packages for FreeBSD are
      developing rapidly.  It is quite possible that in the near
      future many of the problems discussed here will have been
      resolved.  In the mean time, those who
     want to get the very most out of FreeBSD's A/V capabilities will
     have to cobble together knowledge from several FAQs and tutorials
     and use a few different applications.  This section exists to

    <title>Setting Up TV Cards</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>TV cards</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>TV cards allow you to watch broadcast or cable TV on your
	computer.  Most of them accept composite video via an RCA or
	S-video input and some of these cards come with a FM
	radio tuner.</para>

      <para>&os; provides support for PCI-based TV cards using a
	Brooktree Bt848/849/878/879 or a Conexant CN-878/Fusion 878a
	Video Capture Chip with the &man.bktr.4; driver.  You must
	also ensure the board comes with a supported tuner, consult
	the &man.bktr.4; manual page for a list of supported
	tuners.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Adding the Driver</title>

      <para>To use your card, you will need to load the &man.bktr.4;
	driver, this can be done by adding the following line to the
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file like this:</para>

      <programlisting>bktr_load="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, you may statically compile the support for
	the TV card in your kernel, in that case add the following
	lines to your kernel configuration:</para>
	
      <programlisting>device	 bktr
device	iicbus
device	iicbb
device	smbus</programlisting>

      <para>These additional device drivers are necessary because of the
	card components being interconnected via an I2C bus.  Then build
	and install a new kernel.</para>

      <para>Once the support was added to your system, you have to
	reboot your machine.  During the boot process, your TV card
	should show up, like this:</para>

      <programlisting>bktr0: &lt;BrookTree 848A&gt; mem 0xd7000000-0xd7000fff irq 10 at device 10.0 on pci0
iicbb0: &lt;I2C bit-banging driver&gt; on bti2c0
iicbus0: &lt;Philips I2C bus&gt; on iicbb0 master-only
iicbus1: &lt;Philips I2C bus&gt; on iicbb0 master-only
smbus0: &lt;System Management Bus&gt; on bti2c0
bktr0: Pinnacle/Miro TV, Philips SECAM tuner.</programlisting>

      <para>Of course these messages can differ according to your
	hardware.  However you should check if the tuner is correctly
	detected; it is still possible to override some of the
	detected parameters with &man.sysctl.8; MIBs and kernel
	configuration file options.  For example, if you want to force
	the tuner to a Philips SECAM tuner, you should add the
	following line to your kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>options OVERRIDE_TUNER=6</programlisting>

      <para>or you can directly use &man.sysctl.8;:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl hw.bt848.tuner=6</userinput></screen>

      <para>See the &man.bktr.4; manual page and the
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> file for more
	details on the available options. (If you are under
	&os;&nbsp;4.X, <filename>/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</filename> is
	replaced with
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT</filename>.)</para>

      <title>Useful Applications</title>

      <para>To use your TV card you need to install one of the
	following applications:</para>

	Collection.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <para>If you encounter any problem with your TV card, you should
	check at first if the video capture chip and the tuner are
	really supported by the &man.bktr.4; driver and if you used the right
	configuration options.  For more support and various questions
	about your TV card you may want to contact and use the
	archives of the &a.multimedia.name; mailing list.</para>
