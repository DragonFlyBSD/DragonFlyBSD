    <title>Understanding X</title>

    <para>Using X for the first time can be somewhat of a shock to someone
      familiar with other graphical environments, such as &microsoft.windows; or
      &macos;.</para>

    <para>It is not necessary to understand all of the details of various
      X components and how they interact; however, some basic knowledge makes
      it possible to take advantage of X's strengths.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Why X?</title>

      <para>X is not the first window system written for &unix;, but it is the
        most popular.  X's original development team had worked on another
        window system before writing X.  That system's name was
        <quote>W</quote> (for <quote>Window</quote>).  X is just the next
        letter in the Roman alphabet.</para>

      <para>X can be called <quote>X</quote>, <quote>X Window System</quote>,
          <quote>X11</quote>, and other terms.  Calling X11
          <quote>X Windows</quote> can offend some people;
          see &man.X.7; for a bit more insight on this.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The X Client/Server Model</title>

      <para>X was designed from the beginning to be network-centric, and
        adopts a <quote>client-server</quote> model.  In the X model, the
        <quote>X server</quote> runs on the computer that has the keyboard,
        monitor, and mouse attached.  The server is responsible for managing
        the display, handling input from the keyboard and mouse, and so on.
        Each X application (such as <application>XTerm</application>, or
        <application>&netscape;</application>) is a <quote>client</quote>.  A
        client sends messages to the server such as <quote>Please draw a
          window at these coordinates</quote>, and the server sends back
          messages such as <quote>The user just clicked on the OK
          button</quote>.</para>

      <para>If there is only one computer involved, such as in a home or small
        office environment, the X server and the X clients will be running on
        the same computer.  However, it is perfectly possible to run the X
        server on a less powerful desktop computer, and run X applications
        (the clients) on, say, the powerful and expensive machine that serves
        the office.  In this scenario the communication between the X client
        and server takes place over the network.</para>

      <para>This confuses some people, because the X terminology is
        exactly backward to what they expect.  They expect the <quote>X
          server</quote> to be the big powerful machine down the hall, and
        the <quote>X client</quote> to be the machine on their desk.</para>

      <para>Remember that the X server is the machine with the monitor and
        keyboard, and the X clients are the programs that display the
        windows.</para>

      <para>There is nothing in the protocol that forces the client and
        server machines to be running the same operating system, or even to
        be running on the same type of computer.  It is certainly possible to
        run an X server on &microsoft.windows; or Apple's &macos;, and there are
        various free and commercial applications available that do exactly
        that.</para>

      <para>The X server that ships with &os; is called
        <application>&xfree86;</application>, and is available for free, under a
        license very similar to the &os; license.  Commercial X servers for
        FreeBSD are also available, and ought to work with &os; .
        (Unconfirmed as of this writing.)</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Window Manager</title>

      <para>The X design philosophy is much like the &unix; design philosophy,
        <quote>tools, not policy</quote>.  This means that X does not try to
        dictate how a task is to be accomplished.  Instead, tools are provided
        to the user, and it is the user's responsibility to decide how to use
        those tools.</para>

      <para>This philosophy extends to X not dictating what windows should
        look like on screen, how to move them around with the mouse, what
        keystrokes should be used to move between windows (i.e.,
        <keycombo action="simul">
          <keycap>Alt</keycap>
          <keycap>Tab</keycap>
        </keycombo>, in the case of &microsoft.windows;), what the title bars
        on each window should look like, whether or not they have close
        buttons on them, and so on.</para>

      <para>Instead, X delegates this responsibility to an application called
        a <quote>Window Manager</quote>.  There are dozens of window
        managers available for X: <application>AfterStep</application>,
        <application>Blackbox</application>, <application>ctwm</application>,
        <application>Enlightenment</application>,
        <application>fvwm</application>, <application>Sawfish</application>,
        <application>twm</application>,
        <application>Window Maker</application>, and more.  Each of these
        window managers provides a different look and feel; some of them
        support <quote>virtual desktops</quote>; some of them allow customized
        keystrokes to manage the desktop; some have a <quote>Start</quote>
        button or similar device; some are <quote>themeable</quote>, allowing
        a complete change of look-and-feel by applying a new theme.  These
        window managers, and many more, are available in the
        <filename>x11-wm</filename> category of the Ports Collection.</para>

      <para>In addition, the <application>KDE</application> and
	<application>GNOME</application> desktop environments both have their
	own window managers which integrate with the desktop.</para>

      <para>Each window manager also has a different configuration mechanism;
        some expect configuration file written by hand, others feature
        GUI tools for most of the configuration tasks; at least one
        (<application>sawfish</application>) has a configuration file written
        in a dialect of the Lisp language.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Focus Policy</title>

        <para>Another feature the window manager is responsible for is the
          mouse <quote>focus policy</quote>.  Every windowing system
          needs some means of choosing a window to be actively receiving
          keystrokes, and should visibly indicate which window is active as
          well.</para>

        <para>A familiar focus policy is called <quote>click-to-focus</quote>.
          This is the model utilized by &microsoft.windows;, in which a window
          becomes active upon receiving a mouse click.</para>

        <para>X does not support any particular focus policy.  Instead, the
          window manager controls which window has the focus at any one time.
          Different window managers will support different focus methods.  All
          of them support click to focus, and the majority of them support
          several others.</para>

        <para>The most popular focus policies are:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>focus-follows-mouse</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The window that is under the mouse pointer is the
                window that has the focus.  This may not necessarily be
                the window that is on top of all the other windows.
                The focus is changed by pointing at another window, there
                is no need to click in it as well.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>sloppy-focus</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This policy is a small extension to focus-follows-mouse.
                With focus-follows-mouse, if the mouse is moved over the
                root window (or background) then no window has the focus,
                and keystrokes are simply lost.  With sloppy-focus, focus is
                only changed when the cursor enters a new window, and not
                when exiting the current window.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>click-to-focus</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The active window is selected by mouse click.  The
                window may then be <quote>raised</quote>, and appear in
                front of all other windows.  All keystrokes will now be
                directed to this window, even if the cursor is moved to
                another window.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <para>Many window managers support other policies, as well as
          variations on these.  Be sure to consult the documentation for
          the window manager itself.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Widgets</title>

      <para>The X approach of providing tools and not policy extends to the
        widgets seen on screen in each application.</para>

      <para><quote>Widget</quote> is a term for all the items in the user
        interface that can be clicked or manipulated in some way; buttons,
        check boxes, radio buttons, icons, lists, and so on.  &microsoft.windows;
        calls these <quote>controls</quote>.</para>

      <para>&microsoft.windows; and Apple's &macos; both have a very rigid widget
        policy.  Application developers are supposed to ensure that their
        applications share a common look and feel.  With X, it was not
        considered sensible to mandate a particular graphical style, or set
        of widgets to adhere to.</para>

      <para>As a result, do not expect X applications to have a common
        look and feel.  There are several popular widget sets and
        variations, including the original Athena widget set from MIT,
        <application>&motif;</application> (on which the widget set in
        &microsoft.windows; was modeled, all bevelled edges and three shades of
        grey), <application>OpenLook</application>, and others.</para>

      <para>Most newer X applications today will use a modern-looking widget
        set, either Qt, used by <application>KDE</application>, or
        <application>GTK</application>, used by the
        <application>GNOME</application>
        project.  In this respect, there is some convergence in
        look-and-feel of the &unix; desktop, which certainly makes things
        easier for the novice user.</para>

  <sect1 id="x-install">
    <title>Installing &xfree86;</title>

    <para>Before installing <application>&xfree86;</application>, decide on which
      version to run.  <application>&xfree86; 3.X</application> is a maintenance
      branch of <application>&xfree86;</application> development.  It is very
      stable, and it supports a huge number of graphics cards.  However, no new
      development is being done on the software.  <application>&xfree86;
      4.X</application> is a complete redesign of the system with many new
      features such as better support for fonts and anti-aliasing.
      Unfortunately this new architecture requires that the video drivers be
      rewritten, and some of the older cards that were supported in 3.X are not
      yet supported in 4.X.  As all new developments and support for new
      graphics cards are done on that branch, <application>&xfree86;
      4.X</application> is now the default version of the X Window System on
      &os;.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, either version of <application>&xfree86;</application>
      can be installed directly from the FreeBSD binaries provided on the
      <ulink url="http://www.XFree86.org/">&xfree86; web site</ulink>.  A binary
      package to use with &man.pkg.add.1; tool is also available for
      <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application>.  When the remote fetching
      feature of &man.pkg.add.1; is used, the version number of the
      package must be removed.  &man.pkg.add.1; will automatically fetch
      the latest version of the application.  So to fetch and install the
      package of <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application>, simply type:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r XFree86</userinput></screen>

    <para>You can also use the ports collection to install
      <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application>, for that you simply need
      to type the following commands:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11/XFree86-4</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

    <note><para>The examples above will install the complete
      <application>&xfree86;</application> distribution including the
      servers, clients, fonts etc.  Separate packages and ports for
      different parts of <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> are also
      available.</para></note>

    <para>The rest of this chapter will explain how to configure
      <application>&xfree86;</application>, and how to set up a productive desktop
      environment.</para>

<!-- Easiest way is from sysinstall for XFree86 4.X -->

      <title>Before Starting</title>

      <para>Before configuration of <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application>,
        the following information about the target system is needed:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Monitor specifications</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Video Adapter chipset</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Video Adapter memory</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <indexterm><primary>horizontal scan rate</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>vertical scan rate</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The specifications for the monitor are used by
        <application>&xfree86;</application> to determine the resolution and
        refresh rate to run at.  These specifications can usually be
        obtained from the documentation that came with the monitor or from
        the manufacturer's website.  There are two ranges of numbers that
        are needed, the horizontal scan rate and the vertical synchronization
        rate.</para>

      <para>The video adapter's chipset defines what driver module
        <application>&xfree86;</application> uses to talk to the graphics
        hardware.  With most chipsets, this can be automatically
        determined, but it is still useful to know in case the automatic
        detection does not work correctly.</para>

      <para>Video memory on the graphic adapter determines the
        resolution and color depth which the system can run at.  This is
        important to know so the user knows the limitations of the
        system.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring &xfree86; 4.X</title>

      <para>Configuration of <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> is
        a multi-step process.  The first step is to build an initial
        configuration file with the <option>-configure</option> option to
        <application>&xfree86;</application>.  As the super user, simply
        run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>XFree86 -configure</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will generate a skeleton
        <application>&xfree86;</application> configuration file in the
        <filename>/root</filename> directory called
        <filename>XF86Config.new</filename> (in fact the directory used
        is the one covered by the environment variable <envar>$HOME</envar>,
        and it will depend from the way you got the superuser rights).  The
        <application>&xfree86;</application> program will attempt to probe
        the graphics hardware on the system and will write a
        configuration file to load the proper drivers for the detected
        hardware on the target system.</para>

      <para>The next step is to test the existing
        configuration to verify that <application>&xfree86;</application>
        can work with the graphics
        hardware on the target system.  To perform this task, the user
        needs to run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>XFree86 -xf86config XF86Config.new</userinput></screen>

      <para>If a black and grey grid and an X mouse cursor appear,
        the configuration was successful.  To exit the test, just press
        <keycombo action="simul">
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
          <keycap>Alt</keycap>
          <keycap>Backspace</keycap>
        </keycombo> simultaneously.</para>

	<note><para>If the mouse does not work, be sure the device
	  has been configured.  See &man.moused.8 for more information</para></note>

      <indexterm><primary>XFree86 4 Tuning</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Next, tune the <filename>XF86Config.new</filename>
        configuration file to taste.  Open the file in a text editor such
        as &man.emacs.1; or &man.ee.1;.  First, add the
        frequencies for the target system's monitor.  These are usually
        expressed as a horizontal and vertical synchronization rate.  These
        values are added to the <filename>XF86Config.new</filename> file
        under the <literal>"Monitor"</literal> section:</para>

      <programlisting>Section "Monitor"
        Identifier   "Monitor0"
        VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
        ModelName    "Monitor Model"
        HorizSync    30-107
        VertRefresh  48-120
EndSection</programlisting>

      <para>The <varname>HorizSync</varname> and
        <varname>VertRefresh</varname> keywords may not exist in the
        configuration file.  If they do not, they need to be added, with
        the correct horizontal synchronization rate placed after the
        <varname>HorizSync</varname> keyword and the vertical
        synchronization rate after the <varname>VertRefresh</varname>
        keyword.  In the example above the target monitor's rates were
        entered.</para>

      <para>X allows DPMS (Energy Star) features to be used with capable
        monitors. The &man.xset.1; program controls the time-outs and can force
        standby, suspend, or off modes.  If you wish to enable DPMS features
        for your monitor, you must add the following line to the monitor
        section:</para>

      <programlisting>
        Option       "DPMS"</programlisting>

      <indexterm>
        <primary><command>XF86Config</command></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>While the <filename>XF86Config.new</filename>
        configuration file is still open in an editor, select
        the default resolution and color depth desired.  This is
        defined in the <literal>"Screen"</literal> section:</para>

      <programlisting>Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Card0"
        Monitor    "Monitor0"
        DefaultDepth 24
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth     24
                Modes     "1024x768"
        EndSubSection
EndSection</programlisting>

      <para>The <varname>DefaultDepth</varname> keyword describes
        the color depth to run at by default.  This can be overridden
        with the <command>-bpp</command> command line switch to
        &man.XFree86.1;.
        The <varname>Modes</varname> keyword
        describes the resolution to run at for the given color depth.
        Note that only VESA standard modes are supported as defined by
        the target system's graphics hardware.
        In the example above, the default color depth is twenty-four
        bits per pixel.  At this color depth, the accepted resolution is
        one thousand twenty-four pixels by seven hundred and sixty-eight
        pixels.</para>

      <para>Finally, write the configuration file and test it using
        the test mode given above.  If all is well, the configuration
        file needs to be installed in a common location where
        &man.XFree86.1;
        can find it.
        This is typically <filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename> or
        <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename>.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp XF86Config.new /etc/X11/XF86Config</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once the configuration file has been placed in a common
        location, configuration is complete.  In order to start
        <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> with &man.startx.1;,
        install the <filename role="package">x11/wrapper</filename> port.
        <application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> can also be started with
        &man.xdm.1;.</para>

      <note><para>There is also a graphical tool for configuration,
	&man.xf86cfg.1;, that comes with the
	<application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> distribution.  It
	allows to interactively define your configuration by choosing
	the appropriate drivers and settings.  This program can be used under console as well, just use the command <command>xf86cfg -textmode</command>.  For more details,
	refer to the &man.xf86cfg.1; manual page.</para></note>

        <indexterm><primary>Intel i810 graphic chipset</primary></indexterm>

        <para>Configuration with &intel; i810 integrated chipsets
          requires the <devicename>agpgart</devicename>
          AGP programming interface for <application>&xfree86;</application>
          to drive the card.  The &man.agp.4; driver is in the
	  <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel since releases
	  4.8-RELEASE and 5.0-RELEASE.  On prior releases, you will
	  have to add the following line:</para>

	<programlisting>device agp</programlisting>

	<para>in your kernel configuration file and rebuild a new
	  kernel.  Instead, you may want to load
	  the <filename>agp.ko</filename> kernel module
          automatically with the &man.loader.8; at boot time.
          For that, simply add this line to
          <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

        <programlisting>agp_load="YES"</programlisting>

        <para>Next, a
          device node needs to be created for the
          programming interface.  To create the AGP device node, run
          &man.MAKEDEV.8; in the <filename>/dev</filename>
          directory:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV agpgart</userinput></screen>

        <para>This will allow configuration of the hardware as any other
          graphics board.  Note on systems without the &man.agp.4;
	  driver compiled in the kernel, trying to load the module
	  with &man.kldload.8; will not work.  This driver has to be
	  in the kernel at boot time through being compiled in or
	  using <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

	<para>If you are using <application>&xfree86; 4.1.0</application> (or

    <title>Using Fonts in &xfree86;</title>

    <sect2 id="type1">
    <title>Type1 Fonts</title>
    <para>The default fonts that ship with
    <application>&xfree86;</application> are less than ideal for typical
    desktop publishing applications.  Large presentation fonts show up
    jagged and unprofessional looking, and small fonts in
    <application>&netscape;</application> are almost completely unintelligible.
    However, there are several free, high quality Type1 (&postscript;) fonts
    available which can be readily used
    with <application>&xfree86;</application>, either version 3.X or
    version 4.X.  For instance, the URW font collection
    (<filename role="package">x11-fonts/urwfonts</filename>) includes
    high quality versions of standard type1 fonts (<trademark class="registered">Times Roman</trademark>,
    <trademark class="registered">Helvetica</trademark>, <trademark class="registered">Palatino</trademark> and others).  The Freefonts collection
    (<filename role="package">x11-fonts/freefonts</filename>) includes
    many more fonts, but most of them are intended for use in
    graphics software such as the <application>Gimp</application>, and are not
    complete enough to serve as screen fonts.  In addition,
    <application>&xfree86;</application> can be configured to use
    &truetype; fonts with a minimum of effort: see the
    <link linkend="truetype">section on &truetype; fonts</link> later.</para>

    <para>To install the above Type1 font collections from the ports
        collection, run the following commands:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11-fonts/urwfonts</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

    <para>And likewise with the freefont or other collections.  To tell the X
      server that these fonts exist, add an appropriate line to the
      <filename>XF86Config</filename> file (in <filename>/etc/</filename> for
      <application>&xfree86;</application> version 3, or in
      <filename>/etc/X11/</filename> for version 4), which reads:</para>

      <programlisting>FontPath "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/URW/"</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, at the command line in the X session
        run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/URW</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp rehash</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will work but will be lost when the X session is closed,
    unless it is added to the startup file (<filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>
    for a normal <command>startx</command> session,
    or <filename>~/.xsession</filename> when logging in through a
    graphical login manager like <application>XDM</application>).
    A third way is to use the new
    <filename>XftConfig</filename> file: see the
    section on <link linkend="antialias">anti-aliasing</link>.
    </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="truetype">
    <title>&truetype; Fonts</title>

    <indexterm><primary>TrueType Fonts</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>fonts</primary>
      <secondary>TrueType</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para><application>&xfree86; 4.X</application> has built in support
    for rendering &truetype; fonts.  There are two different modules
    that can enable this functionality.  The freetype module is used
    in this example because it is more consistent with the other font
    rendering back-ends.  To enable the freetype module just add the
    following line to the <literal>"Module"</literal> section of the
    <filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename> file.</para>

    <programlisting>Load  "freetype"</programlisting>

    <para>For <application>&xfree86; 3.3.X</application>, a separate
      &truetype; font server is needed.
      <application>Xfstt</application> is commonly used for
      this purpose.  To install <application>Xfstt</application>,
      simply install the port
      <filename role="package">x11-servers/Xfstt</filename>.</para>

    <para>Now make a directory for the &truetype; fonts (for example,
      <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</filename>)
      and copy all of the &truetype; fonts into this directory.  Keep in
      mind that &truetype; fonts cannot be directly taken from a
      &macintosh;; they must be in &unix;/DOS/&windows; format for use by
      <application>&xfree86;</application>.  Once the files have been
      copied into this directory, use
      <application>ttmkfdir</application> to create a
      <filename>fonts.dir</filename> file, so that the X font renderer
      knows that these new files have been installed.
      <command>ttmkfdir</command> is available from the FreeBSD
      Ports Collection as
      <filename role="package">x11-fonts/ttmkfdir</filename>.</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ttmkfdir > fonts.dir</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now add the &truetype; directory to the font
      path.  This is just the same as described above for <link
      linkend="type1">Type1</link> fonts, that is, use</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp rehash</userinput></screen>

    <para>or add a <option>FontPath</option> line to the
       <filename>XF86Config</filename> file.</para>

      <para>That's it.  Now <application>&netscape;</application>,
        <application>Gimp</application>,
        <application>&staroffice;</application>, and all of the other X
        applications should now recognize the installed &truetype;
        fonts.  Extremely small fonts (as with text in a high resolution
        display on a web page) and extremely large fonts (within
        <application>&staroffice;</application>) will look much better
        now.</para>

    <title>Anti-Aliased Fonts</title>

    <indexterm><primary>anti-aliased fonts</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>fonts</primary>
      <secondary>anti-aliased</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>Anti-aliasing has been available in
      <application>&xfree86;</application> since 4.0.2.  However, font
      configuration was cumbersome before the introduction of
      <application>&xfree86;</application> 4.3.0.  Starting in version 4.3.0, 
      all fonts in <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/</filename> and
      <filename>~/.fonts/</filename> are automatically 
      made available for anti-aliasing to Xft-aware applications.  Not
      all applications are Xft-aware yet, but many have received Xft support.
      Examples of Xft-aware applications include Qt 2.3 and higher (the 
      toolkit for the <application>KDE</application> desktop), 
      Gtk+ 2.0 and higher (the toolkit for the 
      <application>GNOME</application> desktop), and 
      <application>Mozilla</application> 1.2 and higher.
    </para>

    <para>In order to control which fonts are anti-aliased, or to
      configure anti-aliasing properties, create (or edit, if it
      already exists) the file
      <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename>.  Several
      advanced features of the Xft font system can be tuned using
      this file; this section describes only some simple
      possibilities.  For more details, please see
      &man.fonts-conf.5;.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>XML</primary></indexterm>

    <para>This file must be in XML format.  Pay careful attention to
      case, and make sure all tags are properly closed.  The file
      begins with the usual XML header followed by a DOCTYPE
      definition, and then the <literal>&lt;fontconfig&gt;</literal> tag:</para>

    <programlisting>
      &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
      &lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
      &lt;fontconfig&gt;
    </programlisting>

    <para>As previously stated, all fonts in
      <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/</filename> as well as
      <filename>~/.fonts/</filename> are already made available to
      Xft-aware applications.  If you wish to add another directory
      outside of these two directory trees, add a line similar to the
      following to
      <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;dir&gt;/path/to/my/fonts&lt;/dir&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>After adding new fonts, and especially new font directories,
      you should run the following command to rebuild the font
      caches:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fc-cache -f</userinput></screen>

    <para>Anti-aliasing makes borders slightly fuzzy, which makes very
      small text more readable and removes <quote>staircases</quote> from
      large text, but can cause eyestrain if applied to normal text.  To
      exclude point sizes smaller than 14 point from anti-aliasing, include
      these lines:</para>

      <programlisting>        &lt;match target="font"&gt;
            &lt;test name="size" compare="less"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;14&lt;/double&gt;
            &lt;/test&gt;
            &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
            &lt;/edit&gt;
        &lt;/match&gt;</programlisting>

    <indexterm><primary>fonts</primary>
      <secondary>spacing</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>Spacing for some monospaced fonts may also be inappropriate
      with anti-aliasing.  This seems to be an issue with
      <application>KDE</application>, in particular.  One possible fix for
      this is to force the spacing for such fonts to be 100.  Add the
      following lines:</para>

     <programlisting>       &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
           &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
               &lt;string&gt;fixed&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;/test&gt;
           &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
               &lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
           &lt;/edit&gt;
        &lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
            &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;console&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/test&gt;
            &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/edit&gt;
        &lt;/match&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>(this aliases the other common names for fixed fonts as
        <literal>"mono"</literal>), and then add:</para>

      <programlisting>         &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
             &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                 &lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
             &lt;/test&gt;
             &lt;edit name="spacing" mode="assign"&gt;
                 &lt;int&gt;100&lt;/int&gt;
             &lt;/edit&gt;
         &lt;/match&gt;      </programlisting>

      <para>Certain fonts, such as Helvetica, may have a problem when
	anti-aliased.  Usually this manifests itself as a font that
	seems cut in half vertically.  At worst, it may cause
	applications such as <application>Mozilla</application> to
	crash.  To avoid this, consider adding the following to
	<filename>local.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>         &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
             &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                 &lt;string&gt;Helvetica&lt;/string&gt;
             &lt;/test&gt;
             &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
                 &lt;string&gt;sans-serif&lt;/string&gt;
             &lt;/edit&gt;
         &lt;/match&gt;        </programlisting>

      <para>Once you have finished editing
        <filename>local.conf</filename> make sure you end the file
        with the <literal>&lt;/fontconfig&gt;</literal> tag.  Not doing this will cause
        your changes to be ignored.</para>

       <para>The default font set that comes with 
         <application>&xfree86;</application> is not very
         desirable when it comes to anti-aliasing.  A much better
	 set of default fonts can be found in the 
	 <filename role="package">x11-fonts/bitstream-vera</filename>
	 port.  This port will install a
	 <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename> file
	 if one does not exist already.  If the file does exist,
	 the port will create a <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf-vera
	 </filename> file.  Merge the contents of this file into
	 <filename>/usr/X11R6/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename>, and the 
	 Bitstream fonts will automatically replace the default 
	 <application>&xfree86;</application> Serif, Sans Serif, and Monospaced 
	 fonts.</para>

       <para>Finally, users can add their own settings via their personal 
        <filename>.fonts.conf</filename> files.  To do this, each user should 
	simply create a <filename>~/.fonts.conf</filename>.  This file must 
	also be in XML format.</para>

       <indexterm><primary>LCD screen</primary></indexterm>
       <indexterm><primary>Fonts</primary>
         <secondary>LCD screen</secondary></indexterm>

       <para>One last point: with an LCD screen, sub-pixel sampling may be
        desired.  This basically treats the (horizontally separated)
        red, green and blue components separately to improve the horizontal
        resolution; the results can be dramatic.  To enable this, add the
        line somewhere in the <filename>local.conf</filename> file:</para>

       <programlisting>
         &lt;match target="font"&gt;
             &lt;test qual="all" name="rgba"&gt;
                 &lt;const&gt;unknown&lt;/const&gt;
             &lt;/test&gt;
             &lt;edit name="rgba" mode="assign"&gt;
                 &lt;const&gt;rgb&lt;/const&gt;
             &lt;/edit&gt;
         &lt;/match&gt;
       </programlisting>

       <note><para>Depending on the sort of display,
	 <literal>rgb</literal> may need to be changed to <literal>bgr</literal>,
	 <literal>vrgb</literal> or <literal>vbgr</literal>: experiment and
	 see which works best.</para></note>

       <indexterm><primary>Mozilla</primary></indexterm>
       <indexterm><primary>web browsers</primary>
         <secondary>Mozilla</secondary>
         <see>Mozilla</see></indexterm>

       <para>Anti-aliasing should be enabled the next time the X
         server is started.  However, programs must know how to take
         advantage of it.  At present, the Qt toolkit does,
         so the entire <application>KDE</application> environment can
         use anti-aliased fonts (see <xref
         linkend="x11-wm-kde-antialias"> on
         <application>KDE</application> for details).  Gtk+ and 
         <application>GNOME</application> can also be made to use 
         anti-aliasing via the <quote>Font</quote> capplet (see <xref
         linkend="x11-wm-gnome-antialias"> for details).  By default,
         <application>Mozilla</application> 1.2 and greater will 
         automatically use anti-aliasing. To disable this, rebuild 
         <application>Mozilla</application> with the
         <makevar>-DWITHOUT_XFT</makevar> flag.</para>

    <title>The X Display Manager</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Overview</title>

      <indexterm><primary>X Display Manager</primary></indexterm>
      <para>The X Display Manager (<application>XDM</application>) is
        an optional part of the X Window System that is used for login
        session management.  This is useful for several types of
        situations, including minimal <quote>X Terminals</quote>,
        desktops, and large network display
        servers.  Since the X Window System is network and protocol
        independent, there are a wide variety of possible configurations
        for running X clients and servers on different machines
        connected by a network.  <application>XDM</application> provides
        a graphical interface for choosing which display server to
        connect to, and entering authorization information such as a
        login and password combination.</para>

      <para>Think of <application>XDM</application> as
        providing the same functionality to the user as the
        &man.getty.8; utility (see <xref linkend="term-config"> for
          details).  That is, it performs system logins to the display
          being connected to and then runs a session manager on behalf of
          the user (usually an X window
          manager).  <application>XDM</application> then waits for this
          program to exit, signaling that the user is done and should be
          logged out of the display.  At this point,
          <application>XDM</application> can display the login and display
          chooser screens for the next user to login.</para>

      <title>Using XDM</title>

      <para>The <application>XDM</application> daemon program is
        located in <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm</filename>.  This program
        can be run at any time as <username>root</username> and it will
        start managing the X display on the local machine.  If
        <application>XDM</application> is to be run every
        time the machine boots up, a convenient way to do this is by
        adding an entry to <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>.  For more
        information about the format and usage of this file, see <xref
        linkend="term-etcttys">.  There is a line in the default
        <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> file for running the
        <application>XDM</application> daemon on a virtual terminal:</para>

      <screen>ttyv8   "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"  xterm   off secure</screen>

      <para>By default this entry is disabled; in order to enable it
        change field 5 from <literal>off</literal> to
        <literal>on</literal> and restart &man.init.8; using the
        directions in <xref linkend="term-hup">.  The first field, the
        name of the terminal this program will manage, is
        <literal>ttyv8</literal>.  This means that
        <application>XDM</application> will start running on the 9th
        virtual terminal.</para>

        <para>The protocol for connecting to

          the X Display Manager Connection Protocol (XDMCP).  This file

          machines.  By default, it allows any client to connect, but
          that does not matter unless the <filename>xdm-config</filename>
          is changed to listen for remote connections.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Xsetup_*</title>
        <para>These will be run automatically before displaying the

          display being used, named <filename>Xsetup_</filename> followed
          by the local display number (for instance
          <filename>Xsetup_0</filename>).  Typically these scripts will
          run one or two programs in the background such as

          that <application>XDM</application> is trying to start hangs
          for some reason, this is a good place to look for error
          messages.  These messages are also written to the user's

        server, edit the access control rules, and enable the connection
        listener.  By default these are set to conservative values.
        To make <application>XDM</application> listen for connections,
        first comment out a line in the <filename>xdm-config</filename>
        file:</para>

      <screen>! SECURITY: do not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests
! Comment out this line if you want to manage X terminals with xdm
DisplayManager.requestPort:     0</screen>

      <para>and then restart <application>XDM</application>.  Remember that
        comments in app-defaults files begin with a <quote>!</quote>
        character, not the usual <quote>#</quote>.  More strict
        access controls may be desired.  Look at the example
        entries in <filename>Xaccess</filename>, and refer to the

        <title>Installing GNOME</title>

        <para>The easiest way to install
          <application>GNOME</application> is with a package or 
	  through the ports collection:</para>

        <para>To install the <application>GNOME</application> package
          from the network, simply type:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r gnome2</userinput></screen>

        <para>To build <application>GNOME</application> from source, use
          the ports tree:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

        <para>Once <application>GNOME</application> is installed,
          the X server must be told to start
          <application>GNOME</application> instead of a default window
          manager.  If a custom <filename>.xinitrc</filename> is already in
          place, simply replace the line that starts the current window
          manager with one that starts
          <application>/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session</application> instead.
          If nothing special has been done to configuration file,
          then it is enough to simply type:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</userinput></screen>

        <para>Next, type <command>startx</command>, and the
          <application>GNOME</application> desktop environment will be
          started.</para>

        <note><para>If a display manager, like
          <application>XDM</application>, is being used, this will not work.
          Instead, create an executable <filename>.xsession</filename>
          file with the same command in it.  To do this, edit the file
          and replace the existing window manager command with
          <application>/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session</application>:
          </para></note>

        <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "#!/bin/sh" > ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session" >> ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod +x ~/.xsession</userinput></screen>

        <para>Another option is to configure the display manager to

          <application>gnome-session</application>.
          Include a label <literal>failsafe</literal>.</para>

        <para>Play with the other menus as well, they are mainly

        <para>Starting with version 4.0.2,

	  this extension.  Configuring this is described in <xref
          linkend="antialias"> on antialiasing X11 fonts.  So, with
          up-to-date software, anti-aliasing is possible on a

	  menu, go to

        <para><application>XFce</application> is a desktop environment
          based on the GTK

          more lightweight and meant for those who want a simple,
          efficient desktop which is nevertheless easy to use and
          configure.  Visually, it looks very much like
          <application>CDE</application>, found on commercial &unix;
          systems.  Some of <application>XFce</application>'s features
          are:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg_add -r xfce4</userinput></screen>

        <para>Alternatively, to build from source, use the ports

&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

        <para>Now, tell the X server to launch
         <application>XFce</application> the next time X is started.
         Simply type this:</para>

        <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "/usr/X11R6/bin/startxfce4" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</userinput></screen>

        <para>The next time X is started,
          <application>XFce</application> will be the desktop.
          As before, if a display manager like
          <filename>xdm</filename> is being used, create an
          <filename>.xsession</filename>, as described in the

          with the <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin/startxfce4</filename>
          command; or, configure the display manager to allow
          choosing a desktop at login time, as explained in
