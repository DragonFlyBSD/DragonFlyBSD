  <title>Installing FreeBSD</title>

    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <indexterm><primary>installation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>FreeBSD is provided with a text-based, easy to use installation
      program called <application>sysinstall</application>.  This is the
      default installation program for FreeBSD, although vendors are free to
      provide their own installation suite if they wish.  This chapter
      describes how to use <application>sysinstall</application> to install
      FreeBSD.</para>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you will know:</para>

	<para>The questions <application>sysinstall</application> will ask
	  you, what they mean, and how to answer them.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Before reading this chapter, you should:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Read the supported hardware list that shipped with the version
	  of FreeBSD you are installing, and verify that your hardware is
	  supported.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>In general, these installation instructions are written
        for &i386; (<quote>PC compatible</quote>) architecture
        computers.  Where applicable, instructions specific to other
        platforms (for example, Alpha) will be listed.  Although this
	guide is kept as up to date as possible, you may find minor
	differences between the installer and what is shown here.  It is
	suggested that you use this chapter as a general guide rather 
	than a literal installation manual.</para>

    <sect2 id="install-inventory">
      <title>Inventory Your Computer</title>

      <para>Before installing FreeBSD you should attempt to inventory the
	components in your computer.  The FreeBSD installation routines will
	show you the components (hard disks, network cards, CDROM drives, and
	so forth) with their model number and manufacturer.  FreeBSD will also
	attempt to determine the correct configuration for these devices,
	which includes information about IRQ and IO port usage.  Due to the
	vagaries of PC hardware this process is not always completely
	successful, and you may need to correct FreeBSD's determination of
	your configuration.</para>

      <para>If you already have another operating system installed, such as
	&windows; or Linux, it is a good idea to use the facilities provided
	by those operating systems to see how your hardware is already
	configured.  If you are not sure what settings an expansion
	card is using, you may find it printed on the card itself.  Popular IRQ
	numbers are 3, 5, and 7, and IO port addresses are normally written as
	hexadecimal numbers, such as 0x330.</para>

      <para>We recommend you print or write down this information before
	installing FreeBSD.  It may help to use a table, like this:</para>

      <title>Backup Your Data</title>
      
      <para>If the computer you will be installing FreeBSD on contains
	valuable data, then ensure you have it backed up, and that you have
	tested the backups before installing FreeBSD.  The FreeBSD
	installation routine will prompt you before writing any
	data to your disk, but once that process has started it cannot be
	undone.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-where">
      <title>Decide Where to Install FreeBSD</title>

      <para>If you want FreeBSD to use your entire hard disk, then there is nothing
	more to concern yourself with at this point &mdash; you can skip this
	section.</para>

      <para>However, if you need FreeBSD to co-exist with other operating
	systems then you need to have a rough understanding of how data is
	laid out on the disk, and how this affects you.</para>

      <sect3 id="install-where-i386">
	<title>Disk Layouts for the &i386;</title>

      <para>A PC disk can be divided into discrete chunks.  These chunks are
	called <firstterm>partitions</firstterm>.  By design, the PC only
	supports four partitions per disk.  These partitions are called
	<firstterm>primary partitions</firstterm>.  To work around this
	limitation and allow more than four partitions, a new partition type
	was created, the <firstterm>extended partition</firstterm>.  A disk
	may contain only one extended partition.  Special partitions, called
	<firstterm>logical partitions</firstterm>, can be created inside this
	extended partition.</para>

      <para>Each partition has a <firstterm>partition ID</firstterm>, which is
	a number used to identify the type of data on the partition.  FreeBSD
	partitions have the partition ID of <literal>165</literal>.</para>

      <para>In general, each operating system that you use will identify
	partitions in a particular way.  For example, DOS, and its
	descendants, like &windows;, assign each primary and logical partition a
	<firstterm>drive letter</firstterm>, starting with
	<devicename>C:</devicename>.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD must be installed into a primary partition.  FreeBSD can
	keep all its data, including any files that you create, on this one
	partition.  However, if you have multiple disks, then you can create a
	FreeBSD partition on all, or some, of them.  When you install FreeBSD,
	you must have one partition available.  This might be a blank
	partition that you have prepared, or it might be an existing partition
	that contains data that you no longer care about.</para>

      <para>If you are already using all the partitions on all your disks, then
	you will have to free one of them for FreeBSD using the tools
	provided by the other operating systems you use (e.g.,
	<command>fdisk</command> on DOS or &windows;).</para>

      <para>If you have a spare partition then you can use that.  However, you
	may need to shrink one or more of your existing partitions
	first.</para>

      <para>A minimal installation of FreeBSD takes as little as 100&nbsp;MB of disk
	space.  However, that is a <emphasis>very</emphasis> minimal install,
	leaving almost no space for your own files.  A more realistic minimum
	is 250&nbsp;MB without a graphical environment, and 350&nbsp;MB or more if you
	want a graphical user interface.  If you intend to install a lot of
	third party software as well, then you will need more space.</para>

      <para>You can use a commercial tool such as <application>&partitionmagic;</application>
	to resize your partitions to make space for
	FreeBSD.  The <filename>tools</filename> directory on the CDROM
	contains two free software tools which can carry out this task, namely
	<application>FIPS</application> and
	<application>PResizer</application>.  Documentation for both
	of these is available in the same directory.
	<application>FIPS</application>,
	<application>PResizer</application>, and
	<application>&partitionmagic;</application> can resize
	<acronym>FAT16</acronym> and <acronym>FAT32</acronym>
	partitions &mdash; used in &ms-dos; through &windows; ME.
	<application>&partitionmagic;</application> is the only known
	application that can resize <acronym>NTFS</acronym>.</para>

      <warning>
	<para>Incorrect use of these tools can delete the data on your disk.
	  Be sure that you have recent, working backups before using
	  them.</para>
      </warning>

      <example>
	<title>Using an Existing Partition Unchanged</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk that
	  already has a version of &windows; installed, and you have split the
	  disk into two drive letters, <devicename>C:</devicename> and
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>, each of which is 2&nbsp;GB in size.  You have
	  1&nbsp;GB of data on <devicename>C:</devicename>, and 0.5&nbsp;GB of data on
	  <devicename>D:</devicename>.</para>

	<para>This means that your disk has two partitions on it, one per
	  drive letter.  You can copy all your existing data from
	  <devicename>D:</devicename> to <devicename>C:</devicename>, which
	  will free up the second partition, ready for FreeBSD.</para>
      </example>

      <example>
	<title>Shrinking an Existing Partition</title>

	<para>Suppose that you have a computer with a single 4&nbsp;GB disk that
	  already has a version of &windows; installed.  When you installed
	  &windows; you created one large partition, giving you a
	  <devicename>C:</devicename> drive that is 4&nbsp;GB in size.  You are
	  currently using 1.5&nbsp;GB of space, and want FreeBSD to have 2&nbsp;GB of
	  space.</para>

	<para>In order to install FreeBSD you will need to either:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Backup your &windows; data, and then reinstall &windows;,
	      asking for a 2&nbsp;GB partition at install time.</para>
	  </listitem>

      <sect3>
	<title>Disk Layouts for the Alpha</title>

	<indexterm><primary>Alpha</primary></indexterm>

	<para>You will need a dedicated disk for FreeBSD on the
	  Alpha.  It is not possible to share a disk with another
	  operating system at this time.  Depending on the specific
	  Alpha machine you have, this disk can either be a SCSI disk
	  or an IDE disk, as long as your machine is capable of
	  booting from it.</para>

	<para>Following the conventions of the Digital / Compaq
	  manuals all SRM input is shown in uppercase.  SRM is case
	  insensitive.</para>

	<para>To find the names and types of disks in your machine, use
	  the <literal>SHOW DEVICE</literal> command from the SRM
	  console prompt:</para>

	<screen>&gt;&gt;&gt;<userinput>SHOW DEVICE</userinput>

pqb0.0.1.4.0               PQB0                       PCI EIDE</screen>

	<para>This example is from a Digital Personal Workstation
	  433au and shows three disks attached to the machine.  The
	  first is a CDROM drive called <devicename>DKA0</devicename> and
	  the other two are disks and are called
	  <devicename>DKC0</devicename> and
	  <devicename>DKC100</devicename> respectively.</para>

	<para>Disks with names of the form <devicename>DKx</devicename>
	  are SCSI disks.  For example <devicename>DKA100</devicename>
	  refers to a SCSI disk with SCSI target ID 1 on the first SCSI bus (A), 
	  whereas <devicename>DKC300</devicename> refers to a SCSI disk
	  with SCSI ID 3 on the third SCSI bus (C).  Devicename <devicename>
	  PKx</devicename> refers to the SCSI host bus adapter.  As
	  seen in the <literal>SHOW DEVICE</literal> output SCSI
	  CDROM drives are treated as any other SCSI hard disk drive.</para>

	<para>IDE disks have names similar to <devicename>DQx</devicename>,
	  while <devicename>PQx</devicename> is the associated IDE
	  controller.</para>

      <title>Collect Your Network Configuration Details</title>

      <para>If you intend to connect to a network as part of your FreeBSD
	installation (for example, if you will be installing from an FTP
	site or an
	NFS server), then you need to know your network configuration.  You
	will be prompted for this information during the installation so that
	FreeBSD can connect to the network to complete the install.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting to an Ethernet Network or Cable/DSL Modem</title>

	<para>If you connect to an Ethernet network, or you have an Internet
	  connection using an Ethernet adapter via cable or DSL, then you will need the following
	  information:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>IP address</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>IP address of the default gateway</para>

	<para>If you do not know this information, then ask your system
	  administrator or service provider.  They may say that this
	  information is assigned automatically, using
	  <firstterm>DHCP</firstterm>.  If so, make a note of this.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Connecting Using a Modem</title>

	<para>If you dial up to an ISP using a regular modem then you can
	  still install FreeBSD over the Internet, it will just take a very
	  long time.</para>

	<para>You will need to know:</para>

      <title>Check for FreeBSD Errata</title>
      
      <para>Although the FreeBSD project strives to ensure that each release
	of FreeBSD is as stable as possible, bugs do occasionally creep into
	the process.  On very rare occasions those bugs affect the
	installation process.  As these problems are discovered and fixed, they
	are noted in the <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/&rel.current;R/errata.html">FreeBSD Errata</ulink>, which is found on the FreeBSD web site.  You
	should check the errata before installing to make sure that there are
	no late-breaking problems which you should be aware of.</para>

      <para>Information about all the releases, including the errata for each
	release, can be found on the 
	<ulink
	url="&url.main;/releases/index.html">release

      <para>If you have purchased FreeBSD on CD or DVD then you already have

	(<xref linkend="install-floppies">).</para>

      <para>If you have not obtained the FreeBSD installation files you should
	skip ahead to <xref linkend="install-diff-media"> which explains how
	to prepare to install FreeBSD from any of the above.  After reading
	that section, you should come back here, and read on to 
	<xref linkend="install-floppies">.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="install-floppies">
      <title>Prepare the Boot Media</title>
      
      <para>The FreeBSD installation process is started by booting your
	computer into the FreeBSD installer&mdash;it is not a program you run
	within another operating system.  Your computer normally boots using
	the operating system installed on your hard disk, but it can also be
	configured to use a <quote>bootable</quote> floppy disk.
	Most modern computers can also
	boot from a CDROM in the CDROM drive.</para>

      <tip>
	<para>If you have FreeBSD on CDROM or DVD (either one you purchased
	  or you prepared yourself), and your computer allows you to boot from
	  the CDROM or DVD (typically a BIOS option called <quote>Boot
	    Order</quote> or similar), then you can skip this section.  The
	  FreeBSD CDROM and DVD images are bootable and can be used to install
	  FreeBSD without any other special preparation.</para>
      </tip>
    
      <para>To create boot floppy images, follow these steps:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Acquire the Boot Floppy Images</title>
	  
	  <para>The boot disks are available on your installation media
	    in the <filename>floppies/</filename> directory, and
	    can also be downloaded from the <ulink
	    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/">
	      floppies directory</ulink> for the &i386; architecture and from this <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/&rel.current;-RELEASE/floppies/">floppies directory</ulink> for the Alpha architecture.</para>

	  <para>The floppy images have a <filename>.flp</filename> extension.
	    The <filename>floppies/</filename> directory contains a number of
	    different images, and the ones you will need to use depends on the
	    version of FreeBSD you are installing, and in some cases, the
	    hardware you are installing to.  In most cases you will just need
	    two files, <filename>kern.flp</filename> and
	    <filename>mfsroot.flp</filename>.  Additional device drivers may
	    be necessary for some systems.  These drivers are provided
	    on the <filename>drivers.flp</filename> image.  Check
	    <filename>README.TXT</filename> in the same directory for the
	    most up to date information about these floppy images.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>Your FTP program must use <emphasis>binary mode</emphasis>
	      to download these disk images.  Some web browsers have been
	      known to use <emphasis>text</emphasis> (or
	      <emphasis>ASCII</emphasis>) mode, which will be apparent if you
	      cannot boot from the disks.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Prepare the Floppy Disks</title>
	  
	  <para>You must prepare one floppy disk per image file you had to
	    download.  It is imperative that these disks are free from
	    defects.  The easiest way to test this is to format the disks
	    for yourself.  Do not trust pre-formatted floppies.  The format
	    utility in &windows; will not tell about the presence of
	    bad blocks, it simply marks them as <quote>bad</quote>
	    and ignores them.  It is advised that you use brand new
	    floppies if choosing this installation route.</para>

	  <important>
	    <para>If you try to install FreeBSD and the installation
	      program crashes, freezes, or otherwise misbehaves, one of
	      the first things to suspect is the floppies.  Try writing
	      the floppy image files to new disks and try
	      again.</para>
	  </important>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Write the Image Files to the Floppy Disks</title>

      <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

      <note><para>From FreeBSD versions 5.0 and later, userconfig has been deprecated
	in favor of the new &man.device.hints.5; method.  For more information
	on &man.device.hints.5; please visit <xref linkend="device-hints"></para></note>

      <para>The <firstterm>kernel</firstterm> is the core of the operating
	system.  It is responsible for many things, including access to all
	the devices you may have on your system, such as hard disks, network
	cards, sound cards, and so on.  Each piece of hardware supported by
	the FreeBSD kernel has a driver associated with it.  Each driver has a
	two or three letter name, such as <devicename>sa</devicename> for the
	SCSI sequential access driver, or <devicename>sio</devicename> for the
	Serial I/O driver (which manages COM ports).</para>

      <para>When the kernel starts, each driver checks the system to see
	whether or not the hardware it supports exists on your system.  If it
	does, then the driver configures the hardware and makes it available
	to the rest of the kernel.</para>

      <para>This checking is commonly referred to as <firstterm>device
	  probing</firstterm>.  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to do
	this in a safe way.  Some hardware drivers do not co-exist well,
	and probing for one piece of hardware can sometimes leave
	another in an inconsistent state.  This is a basic
	limitation of the <acronym>PC</acronym> design.</para>

      <para>Many older devices are called ISA devices&mdash;as opposed
	to PCI devices.  The ISA specification requires each device to have
	some information hard coded into it, typically the Interrupt Request
	Line number (IRQ) and IO port address that the driver uses.  This
	information is commonly set by using physical
	<firstterm>jumpers</firstterm> on the card, or by using a DOS based
	utility.</para>

      <para>This was often a source of problems, because it was not possible
	to have two devices that shared the same IRQ or port address.</para>

      <para>Newer devices follow the PCI specification, which does not require
	this, as the devices are supposed to cooperate with the BIOS, and are
	told which IRQ and IO port addresses to use.</para>

      <para>If you have any ISA devices in your computer then FreeBSD's
	driver for that device will need to be configured with the IRQ and
	port address that you have set the card to.  This is why carrying out
	an inventory of	your hardware (see <xref
	linkend="install-inventory">) can be useful.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the default IRQs and memory ports used by some
	drivers clash.  This is because some ISA devices are shipped with IRQs
	or memory ports that clash.  The defaults in FreeBSD's drivers are
	deliberately set to mirror the manufacturer's defaults, so that, out
	of the box, as many devices as possible will work.</para>

      <para>This is almost never an issue when running FreeBSD day-to-day.
	Your computer will not normally contain two pieces of hardware that
	clash, because one of them would not work (irrespective of the
	operating system you are using).</para>

      <para>It becomes an issue when you are installing FreeBSD for the first
	time because the kernel used to carry out the install has to contain
	as many drivers as possible, so that many different hardware
	configurations can be supported.  This means that some of
	those drivers will have conflicting configurations.  The devices are
	probed in a strict order, and if you own a device that is probed late
	in the process, but conflicted with an earlier probe, then your
	hardware might not function or be probed correctly when you install
	FreeBSD.</para>

      <para>Because of this, the first thing you have the opportunity to do
	when installing FreeBSD is look at the list of drivers that are
	configured into the kernel, and either disable some of them, if you
	do not own that device, or confirm (and alter) the driver's
	configuration if you do own the device but the defaults are
	wrong.</para>

      <para>This probably sounds much more complicated than it actually
	is.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="kernel-config"> shows the first kernel
	configuration menu.  We recommend that you choose the
	<guimenuitem>Start kernel configuration in full-screen visual
	  mode</guimenuitem> option, as it presents the easiest interface for

	  <para>The procedure for changing the address on the hardware varies

      <title>BIOS Drive Numbering</title>

      <para>Before you install and configure FreeBSD on your system, there is an
	important subject that you should be aware of, especially if you have
	multiple hard drives.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Microsoft Windows</primary></indexterm>
      <para>In a PC running a BIOS-dependent operating system such as
	&ms-dos; or &microsoft.windows;, the BIOS is able to abstract the
	normal disk drive order, and
	the operating system goes along with the change.  This allows the user
	to boot from a disk drive other than the so-called <quote>primary
	  master</quote>.  This is especially convenient for some users who have
	found that the simplest and cheapest way to keep a system backup is to
	buy an identical second hard drive, and perform routine copies of the
	first drive to the second drive using 
	<application><trademark class="registered">Ghost</trademark></application> or <application>XCOPY</application>
	.  Then, if the
	first drive fails, or is attacked by a virus, or is scribbled upon by an
	operating system defect, he can easily recover by instructing the BIOS
	to logically swap the drives.  It is like switching the cables on the
	drives, but without having to open the case.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>SCSI</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>BIOS</primary></indexterm>
      <para>More expensive systems with SCSI controllers often include BIOS
	extensions which allow the SCSI drives to be re-ordered in a similar
	fashion for up to seven drives.</para>

      <para>A user who is accustomed to taking advantage of these features may
	become surprised when the results with FreeBSD are not as expected.
	FreeBSD does not use the BIOS, and does not know the <quote>logical BIOS
	  drive mapping</quote>.  This can lead to very perplexing situations,
	especially when drives are physically identical in geometry, and have
	also been made as data clones of one another.</para>

      <para>When using FreeBSD, always restore the BIOS to natural drive
	numbering before installing FreeBSD, and then leave it that way.  If you
	need to switch drives around, then do so, but do it the hard way, and
	open the case and move the jumpers and cables.</para>

	<title>An Illustration from the Files of Bill and Fred's Exceptional
	  Adventures:</title>
      
	<para>Bill breaks-down an older Wintel box to make another FreeBSD box
	  for Fred.  Bill installs a single SCSI drive as SCSI unit zero and
	  installs FreeBSD on it.</para>

	<para>Fred begins using the system, but after several days notices that
	  the older SCSI drive is reporting numerous soft errors and reports
	  this fact to Bill.</para>

	<para>After several more days, Bill decides it is time to address the
	  situation, so he grabs an identical SCSI drive from the disk drive
	  <quote>archive</quote> in the back room.  An initial surface scan
	  indicates that
	  this drive is functioning well, so Bill installs this drive as SCSI
	  unit four and makes an image copy from drive zero to drive four.  Now
	  that the new drive is installed and functioning nicely, Bill decides
	  that it is a good idea to start using it, so he uses features in the
	  SCSI BIOS to re-order the disk drives so that the system boots from
	  SCSI unit four.  FreeBSD boots and runs just fine.</para>

	<para>Fred continues his work for several days, and soon Bill and Fred
	  decide that it is time for a new adventure -- time to upgrade to a
	  newer version of FreeBSD.  Bill removes SCSI unit zero because it was
	  a bit flaky and replaces it with another identical disk drive from
	  the <quote>archive</quote>.  Bill then installs the new version of
	  FreeBSD onto the new SCSI unit zero using Fred's magic Internet FTP
	  floppies.  The installation goes well.</para>

	<para>Fred uses the new version of FreeBSD for a few days, and certifies
	  that it is good enough for use in the engineering department.  It is
	  time to copy all of his work from the old version.  So Fred mounts
	  SCSI unit four (the latest copy of the older FreeBSD version).  Fred
	  is dismayed to find that none of his precious work is present on SCSI
	  unit four.</para>

	<para>Where did the data go?</para>

	<para>When Bill made an image copy of the original SCSI unit zero onto
	  SCSI unit four, unit four became the <quote>new clone</quote>.
	  When Bill re-ordered the SCSI BIOS so that he could boot from
	  SCSI unit four, he was only fooling himself.
	  FreeBSD was still running on SCSI unit zero.
	  Making this kind of BIOS change will cause some or all of the Boot and
	  Loader code to be fetched from the selected BIOS drive, but when the
	  FreeBSD kernel drivers take-over, the BIOS drive numbering will be
	  ignored, and FreeBSD will transition back to normal drive numbering.
	  In the illustration at hand, the system continued to operate on the
	  original SCSI unit zero, and all of Fred's data was there, not on SCSI
	  unit four.  The fact that the system appeared to be running on SCSI
	  unit four was simply an artifact of human expectations.</para>

	<para>We are delighted to mention that no data bytes were killed or
	  harmed in any way by our discovery of this phenomenon.  The older SCSI
	  unit zero was retrieved from the bone pile, and all of Fred's work was
	  returned to him, (and now Bill knows that he can count as high as
	  zero).</para>

	<para>Although SCSI drives were used in this illustration, the concepts
	  apply equally to IDE drives.</para>

 In the next menu, you will need to set up a DOS-style ("fdisk")
 partitioning scheme for your hard disk. If you simply wish to devote
 all disk space to FreeBSD (overwriting anything else that might be on
 the disk(s) selected) then use the (A)ll command to select the default

 free space to FreeBSD, move to a partition marked "unused" and use the

      <para>Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> as instructed.  You will then be
	shown a list of all the hard drives that the kernel found when it
	carried out the device probes.  
	<xref linkend="sysinstall-fdisk-drive1"> shows an example from a
	system with two IDE disks.  They have been called
	<devicename>ad0</devicename> and <devicename>ad2</devicename>.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>You might be wondering why <devicename>ad1</devicename> is not
	listed here.  Why has it been missed?</para>

      <para>Consider what would happen if you had two IDE hard disks, one
	as the master on the first IDE controller, and one as the master on
	the second IDE controller.  If FreeBSD numbered these as it found
	them, as <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad1</devicename> then everything would work.</para>

      <para>But if you then added a third disk, as the slave device on the
	first IDE controller, it would now be <devicename>ad1</devicename>,
	and the previous <devicename>ad1</devicename> would become
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>.  Because device names (such as
	<devicename>ad1s1a</devicename>) are used to find filesystems, you
	may suddenly discover that some of your filesystems no longer
	appear correctly, and you would need to change your FreeBSD
	configuration.</para>
      
      <para>To work around this, the kernel can be configured to name IDE
	disks based on where they are, and not the order in which they were
	found.  With this scheme the master disk on the second IDE
	controller will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>, even if there are no
	<devicename>ad0</devicename> or <devicename>ad1</devicename>
	devices.</para>

      <para>This configuration is the default for the FreeBSD kernel, which
	is why this display shows <devicename>ad0</devicename> and
	<devicename>ad2</devicename>.  The machine on which this screenshot
	was taken had IDE disks on both master channels of the IDE
	controllers, and no disks on the slave channels.</para>

      <para>You should select the disk on which you want to install FreeBSD,
	and then press &gui.ok;.

      <para>The first section, covering the first two lines of the display,
	shows details about the currently selected disk, including its FreeBSD

      <para>The second section shows the slices that are currently on the
	disk, where they start and end, how large they are, the name FreeBSD
	gives them, and their description and sub-type.  This example shows two
	small unused slices, which are artifacts of disk layout schemes on the
	PC.  It also shows one large <acronym>FAT</acronym> slice, which almost certainly appears
	as <devicename>C:</devicename> in &ms-dos; / &windows;, and an extended
	slice, which may contain other drive letters for &ms-dos; / &windows;.</para>

      <para>The third section shows the commands that are available in

	The existing slices will be removed, and replaced with a small area
	flagged as <literal>unused</literal> (again, an artifact of PC disk
	layout), and then one large slice for FreeBSD.  If you do this, then
	you should select the newly created FreeBSD slice using the arrow
	keys, and press <keycap>S</keycap> to mark the slice as being
	bootable.  The screen will then look very similar to 
	<xref linkend="sysinstall-fdisk2">.  Note the
	<literal>A</literal> in the <literal>Flags</literal> column, which
	indicates that this slice is <emphasis>active</emphasis>, and will be

      <para>If you will be deleting an existing slice to make space for
	FreeBSD then you should select the slice using the arrow keys, and
	then press <keycap>D</keycap>.  You can then press <keycap>C</keycap>,
	and be prompted for size of slice you want to create.  Enter the
	appropriate figure and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  The default
        value in this box represents the largest possible slice you can
	make, which could be the largest contiguous block of unallocated
	space or the size of the entire hard disk.</para>
      
      <para>If you have already made space for FreeBSD (perhaps by using a

		  If you have more than one disk then you can put swap

		  swap, which effectively speeds up the act of swapping.  In
		  this case, calculate the total amount of swap you need
		  (e.g., 128&nbsp;MB), and then divide this by the number of disks
		  you have (e.g., two disks) to give the amount of swap you

 Would you like to install the FreeBSD ports collection? 

 This will give you ready access to over &os.numports; ported software packages,
 at a cost of around &ports.size; of disk space when "clean" and possibly much
 more than that if a lot of the distribution tarballs are loaded
 (unless you have the extra CDs from a FreeBSD CD/DVD distribution
 available and can mount it on /cdrom, in which case this is far less
 of a problem). 

 The ports collection is a very valuable resource and well worth having
 on your /usr partition, so it is advisable to say Yes to this option.

	    <para>This option instructs <application>sysinstall</application> to use the HTTP
	      protocol (like a web browser) to connect to a proxy
	      for all FTP operations.  The proxy will translate
	      the requests and send them to the FTP server.
	      This allows the user to pass through firewalls
	      that do not allow FTP at all, but offer a HTTP
	      proxy.
	      In this case, you have to specify the proxy in

      <para>For a proxy FTP server, you should usually give the name of the

	the real server.  For example, assuming you want to install from
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>, using the proxy FTP
	server <hostid role="fqdn">foo.example.com</hostid>, listening on port
	1024.</para>
      
      <para>In this case, you go to the options menu, set the FTP username
	to <literal>ftp@ftp.FreeBSD.org</literal>, and the password to your
	email address.  As your installation media, you specify FTP (or
	passive FTP, if the proxy supports it), and the URL
	<literal>ftp://foo.example.com:1234/pub/FreeBSD</literal>.</para>

      <para>Since <filename>/pub/FreeBSD</filename> from 
	<hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid> is proxied under

      <para>Configuring network services can be a daunting

	knowledge in this area.  Networking, including the Internet,
	is critical to all modern operating systems including &os;;
	as a result, it is very useful to have some understanding
	&os;'s extensive networking capabilities.  Doing this
	during the installation will ensure users have some
	understanding of the various services available to them.</para>

      <para>Network services are programs that accept input from
	anywhere on the network.  Every effort is made to make sure
	these programs will not do anything <quote>harmful</quote>.
	Unfortunately, programmers are not perfect and through time
	there have been cases where bugs in network services have been
	exploited by attackers to do bad things.  It is important that
	you only enable the network services you know that you need.  If
	in doubt it is best if you do not enable a network service until
	you find out that you do need it.  You can always enable it
	later by re-running <application>sysinstall</application> or by
	using the features provided by the
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenu>Networking</guimenu> option will display
	a menu similar to the one below:</para>

      <para>The first option, <guimenuitem>Interfaces</guimenuitem>, was previously covered during
	the <xref linkend="inst-network-dev">, thus this option can
	safely be ignored.</para>

      <para>Selecting the <guimenuitem>AMD</guimenuitem> option adds
	support for the <acronym>BSD</acronym> automatic mount utility.
	This is usually used in conjunction with the
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> protocol (see below)
	for automatically mounting remote file systems.
	No special configuration is required here.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>AMD Flags</guimenuitem>
	option.  When selected, a menu will pop up for you
	to enter specific <acronym>AMD</acronym> flags.
	The menu already contains a set of default options:</para>

      <screen>-a /.amd_mnt -l syslog /host /etc/amd.map /net /etc/amd.map</screen>

      <para>The <literal>-a</literal> option sets the default mount
	location which is specified here as
	<filename>/.amd_mnt</filename>.  The <literal>-l</literal>
	option specifies the default <filename>log</filename> file;
	however, when <literal>syslogd</literal> is used all log
	activity will be sent to the system log daemon.  The
	<filename role="directory">/host</filename> directory is used
	to mount an exported file system from a remote
	host, while <filename role="directory">/net</filename>
	directory is used to mount an exported file system from an
	<acronym>IP</acronym> address.  The
	<filename>/etc/amd.map</filename> file defines the default
	options for <acronym>AMD</acronym> exports.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Anon FTP</guimenuitem> option permits anonymous
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> connections.  Select this option to
	make this machine an anonymous <acronym>FTP</acronym> server.
	Be aware of the security risks involved with this option.
	Another menu will be displayed to explain the security risks
	and configuration in depth.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> configuration menu will set
	the machine up to be a gateway as explained previously.  This
	can be used to unset the <guimenuitem>Gateway</guimenuitem> option if you accidentally
	selected it during the installation process.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Inetd</guimenuitem> option can be used to configure
	or completely disable the &man.inetd.8; daemon as discussed
	above.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>Mail</guimenuitem> option is used to configure the system's
	default <acronym>MTA</acronym> or Mail Transfer Agent.
	Selecting this option will bring up the following menu:</para>

	    <imagedata fileref="install/mta-main" format="PNG">

      </figure>

      <para>Here you are offered a choice as to which
	<acronym>MTA</acronym> to install
	and set as the default.  An <acronym>MTA</acronym> is nothing
	more than a mail server which delivers email to users on the
	system or the Internet.</para>

      <para>Selecting <guimenuitem>Sendmail</guimenuitem> will install
	the popular <application>sendmail</application> server which
	is the &os; default.  The <guimenuitem>Sendmail local</guimenuitem> option
	will set <application>sendmail</application> to be the default
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>, but disable its ability to receive
	incoming email from the Internet.  The other options here,
	<guimenuitem>Postfix</guimenuitem> and
	<guimenuitem>Exim</guimenuitem> act similar to
	<guimenuitem>Sendmail</guimenuitem>.  They both deliver
	email; however, some users prefer these alternatives to the
	<application>sendmail</application>
	<acronym>MTA</acronym>.</para>

      <para>After selecting an <acronym>MTA</acronym>, or choosing
	not to select an MTA, the network configuration menu will appear
	with the next option being <guimenuitem>NFS client</guimenuitem>.</para>

      <para>The <guimenuitem>NFS client</guimenuitem> option will
	configure the system to communicate with a server via
	<acronym>NFS</acronym>.  An <acronym>NFS</acronym> server
	makes file systems available to other machines on the
	network via the <acronym>NFS</acronym> protocol.  If this is
	a stand alone machine, this option can remain unselected.
	The system may require more configuration later; see
	<xref linkend="network-nfs"> for more
	information about client and server configuration.</para>

      <para>Below that option is the <guimenuitem>NFS server</guimenuitem>
	option, permitting you to set the system up as an
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> server.  This adds the required
	information to start up the <acronym>RPC</acronym> remote
	procedure call services.  <acronym>RPC</acronym> is used to
	coordinate connections between hosts and programs.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>Ntpdate</guimenuitem> option,
	which deals with time synchronization.  When selected, a menu
	like the one below shows up:</para>

      <figure id="Ntpdate-config">

	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="install/ntp-config" format="PNG">
	  </imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>From this menu, select the server which is the closest
	to your location.  Selecting a close one will make the time
	synchronization more accurate as a server further from your
	location may have more connection latency.</para>

      <para>The next option is the <acronym>PCNFSD</acronym> selection.
	This option will install the
	<filename role="package">net/pcnfsd</filename> package from
	the ports collection.  This is a useful utility which provides
	<acronym>NFS</acronym> authentication services for systems which
	are unable to provide their own, such as Microsoft's
	&ms-dos; operating system.</para>

      <para>Now you must scroll down a bit to see the other
	options:</para>

      <para>The &man.rpcbind.8;, &man.rpc.statd.8;, and
	&man.rpc.lockd.8; utilities are all used for Remote Procedure
	Calls (<acronym>RPC</acronym>).
	The <command>rpcbind</command> utility manages communication
	between <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients, and is
	required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers to operate
	correctly.  The <application>rpc.statd</application> daemon interacts
	with the <application>rpc.statd</application> daemon on other hosts to
	provide status monitoring.  The reported status is usually held
	in the <filename>/var/db/statd.status</filename> file.  The
	next option listed here is the <guimenuitem>rpc.lockd</guimenuitem>
	option, which, when selected, will provide file locking
	services.  This is usually used with
	<application>rpc.statd</application> to monitor what hosts are
	requesting locks and how frequently they request them.
	While these last two options are marvelous for debugging, they
	are not required for <acronym>NFS</acronym> servers and clients
	to operate correctly.</para>

      <para>As you progress down the list the next item here is
	<guimenuitem>Routed</guimenuitem>, which is the routing daemon.  The
	&man.routed.8; utility manages network routing tables,
	discovers multicast routers, and supplies a copy of the routing
	tables to any physically connected host on the network upon
	request.  This is mainly used for machines which act as a
	gateway for the local network (see the &man.icmp.4; and
	&man.udp.4; manual pages).  When selected, a menu will be
	presented requesting the default location of the utility.
	The default location is already defined for you and can be
	selected with the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key.  You will then
	be presented with yet another menu, this time asking for the
	flags you wish to pass on to <application>routed</application>.  The
	default is <literal>-q</literal> and it should already appear
	on the screen.</para>

      <para>Next in line is the <guimenuitem>Rwhod</guimenuitem> option which,
	when selected, will start the &man.rwhod.8; daemon
	during system initialization.  The <command>rwhod</command>

      <para>The next to the last option in the list is for the

	<application>OpenSSH</application> and it is highly recommended
	over the standard <application>telnet</application> and
	<acronym>FTP</acronym> servers.  The <application>sshd</application>
	server is used to create a secure connection from one host to
	another by using encrypted connections.</para>

      <para>Finally there is the <guimenuitem>TCP Extensions</guimenuitem>
	option.  This enables the <acronym>TCP</acronym> Extensions
	defined in <acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1323 and
	<acronym>RFC</acronym>&nbsp;1644.  While on many hosts this can
	speed up connections, it can also cause some connections to be

 You have configured and been running the mouse daemon. 
 Choose "/dev/sysmouse" as the mouse port and "SysMouse" or
 "MouseSystems" as the mouse protocol in the X configuration utility. 

                                 [ OK ]

	Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to continue.</para>

      <para>Starting <application>xf86config</application> will display
	a brief introduction:</para>

      <screen>This program will create a basic XF86Config file, based on menu selections you
make.

The XF86Config file usually resides in /usr/X11R6/etc/X11 or /etc/X11. A sample
XF86Config file is supplied with XFree86; it is configured for a standard
VGA card and monitor with 640x480 resolution. This program will ask for a
pathname when it is ready to write the file.

You can either take the sample XF86Config as a base and edit it for your
configuration, or let this program produce a base XF86Config file for your
configuration and fine-tune it.

Before continuing with this program, make sure you know what video card
you have, and preferably also the chipset it uses and the amount of video
memory on your video card. SuperProbe may be able to help with this.

Press enter to continue, or ctrl-c to abort.</screen>

      <para>Pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> will start the mouse
	configuration.  Be sure to follow the instructions and use
	<quote>Mouse Systems</quote> as the mouse protocol and
	<devicename>/dev/sysmouse</devicename> as the mouse port even if
	using a PS/2 mouse is shown as an illustration.</para>

      <screen>First specify a mouse protocol type. Choose one from the following list:

 1.  Microsoft compatible (2-button protocol)
 2.  Mouse Systems (3-button protocol) & FreeBSD moused protocol
 3.  Bus Mouse
 4.  PS/2 Mouse
 5.  Logitech Mouse (serial, old type, Logitech protocol)
 6.  Logitech MouseMan (Microsoft compatible)
 7.  MM Series
 8.  MM HitTablet
 9.  Microsoft IntelliMouse

If you have a two-button mouse, it is most likely of type 1, and if you have
a three-button mouse, it can probably support both protocol 1 and 2. There are
two main varieties of the latter type: mice with a switch to select the
protocol, and mice that default to 1 and require a button to be held at
boot-time to select protocol 2. Some mice can be convinced to do 2 by sending
a special sequence to the serial port (see the ClearDTR/ClearRTS options).

Enter a protocol number: 2

You have selected a Mouse Systems protocol mouse. If your mouse is normally
in Microsoft-compatible mode, enabling the ClearDTR and ClearRTS options
may cause it to switch to Mouse Systems mode when the server starts.

Please answer the following question with either 'y' or 'n'.
Do you want to enable ClearDTR and ClearRTS? n

You have selected a three-button mouse protocol. It is recommended that you
do not enable Emulate3Buttons, unless the third button doesn't work.

Please answer the following question with either 'y' or 'n'.
Do you want to enable Emulate3Buttons? y

Now give the full device name that the mouse is connected to, for example
/dev/tty00. Just pressing enter will use the default, /dev/mouse.
On FreeBSD, the default is /dev/sysmouse.

Mouse device: /dev/sysmouse</screen>

Please answer the following question with either 'y' or 'n'.
Do you want to select additional XKB options (group switcher,
group indicator, etc.)? n</screen>

      <para>Next, we proceed to the configuration for the monitor.  Do not
	exceed the ratings of your monitor. Damage could occur.  If you
	have any doubts, do the configuration after you have the
	information.</para>

      <screen>Now we want to set the specifications of the monitor. The two critical
parameters are the vertical refresh rate, which is the rate at which the
whole screen is refreshed, and most importantly the horizontal sync rate,
which is the rate at which scanlines are displayed.

The valid range for horizontal sync and vertical sync should be documented
in the manual of your monitor. If in doubt, check the monitor database
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/Monitors to see if your monitor is there.

Press enter to continue, or ctrl-c to abort.



You must indicate the horizontal sync range of your monitor. You can either
select one of the predefined ranges below that correspond to industry-
standard monitor types, or give a specific range.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you do not specify a monitor type with a horizontal
sync range that is beyond the capabilities of your monitor. If in doubt,
choose a conservative setting.

    hsync in kHz; monitor type with characteristic modes
 1  31.5; Standard VGA, 640x480 @ 60 Hz
 2  31.5 - 35.1; Super VGA, 800x600 @ 56 Hz
 3  31.5, 35.5; 8514 Compatible, 1024x768 @ 87 Hz interlaced (no 800x600)
 4  31.5, 35.15, 35.5; Super VGA, 1024x768 @ 87 Hz interlaced, 800x600 @ 56 Hz
 5  31.5 - 37.9; Extended Super VGA, 800x600 @ 60 Hz, 640x480 @ 72 Hz
 6  31.5 - 48.5; Non-Interlaced SVGA, 1024x768 @ 60 Hz, 800x600 @ 72 Hz
 7  31.5 - 57.0; High Frequency SVGA, 1024x768 @ 70 Hz
 8  31.5 - 64.3; Monitor that can do 1280x1024 @ 60 Hz
 9  31.5 - 79.0; Monitor that can do 1280x1024 @ 74 Hz
10  31.5 - 82.0; Monitor that can do 1280x1024 @ 76 Hz
11  Enter your own horizontal sync range

Enter your choice (1-11): 6

You must indicate the vertical sync range of your monitor. You can either
select one of the predefined ranges below that correspond to industry-
standard monitor types, or give a specific range. For interlaced modes,
the number that counts is the high one (e.g. 87 Hz rather than 43 Hz).

 1  50-70
 2  50-90
 3  50-100
 4  40-150
 5  Enter your own vertical sync range

Enter your choice: 2

You must now enter a few identification/description strings, namely an
identifier, a vendor name, and a model name. Just pressing enter will fill
in default names.

The strings are free-form, spaces are allowed.
Enter an identifier for your monitor definition: Hitachi</screen>

      <para>The selection of a video card driver from a list is
	next.  If you pass your card on the list, continue to press
	<keycap>Enter</keycap> and the list will repeat.  Only an
	excerpt from the list is shown:</para>

      <screen>Now we must configure video card specific settings. At this point you can
choose to make a selection out of a database of video card definitions.
Because there can be variation in Ramdacs and clock generators even
between cards of the same model, it is not sensible to blindly copy
the settings (e.g. a Device section). For this reason, after you make a
selection, you will still be asked about the components of the card, with
the settings from the chosen database entry presented as a strong hint.

The database entries include information about the chipset, what driver to
run, the Ramdac and ClockChip, and comments that will be included in the
Device section. However, a lot of definitions only hint about what driver
to run (based on the chipset the card uses) and are untested.

If you can't find your card in the database, there's nothing to worry about.
You should only choose a database entry that is exactly the same model as
your card; choosing one that looks similar is just a bad idea (e.g. a
GemStone Snail 64 may be as different from a GemStone Snail 64+ in terms of
hardware as can be).

Now you must give information about your video card. This will be used for
the "Device" section of your video card in XF86Config.

You must indicate how much video memory you have. It is probably a good
idea to use the same approximate amount as that detected by the server you
intend to use. If you encounter problems that are due to the used server
not supporting the amount memory you have (e.g. ATI Mach64 is limited to
1024K with the SVGA server), specify the maximum amount supported by the
server.

How much video memory do you have on your video card:

 1  256K
 2  512K
 3  1024K
 4  2048K
 5  4096K
 6  Other

Enter your choice: 6

Amount of video memory in Kbytes: 8192

You must now enter a few identification/description strings, namely an
identifier, a vendor name, and a model name. Just pressing enter will fill
in default names (possibly from a card definition).

Your card definition is Matrox Millennium G200 8MB.

The strings are free-form, spaces are allowed.
Enter an identifier for your video card definition:</screen>

      <para>Next, the video modes are set for the resolutions
	desired.  Typically, useful ranges are 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768
	but those are a function of video card capability, monitor size,
	and eye comfort.  When selecting a color depth, select the highest
	mode that your card will support.</para>

      <screen>For each depth, a list of modes (resolutions) is defined. The default
resolution that the server will start-up with will be the first listed
mode that can be supported by the monitor and card.
Currently it is set to:

"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768" "1280x1024" for 8-bit
"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768" "1280x1024" for 16-bit
"640x480" "800x600" "1024x768" "1280x1024" for 24-bit

Modes that cannot be supported due to monitor or clock constraints will
be automatically skipped by the server.

 1  Change the modes for 8-bit (256 colors)
 2  Change the modes for 16-bit (32K/64K colors)
 3  Change the modes for 24-bit (24-bit color)
 4  The modes are OK, continue.

Enter your choice: 2

Select modes from the following list:

 1  "640x400"
 2  "640x480"
 3  "800x600"
 4  "1024x768"

 9  "1152x864"
 a  "1600x1200"
 b  "1800x1400"
 c  "512x384"

Please type the digits corresponding to the modes that you want to select.
For example, 432 selects "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480", with a
default mode of 1024x768.

Which modes? 432

You can have a virtual screen (desktop), which is screen area that is larger
than the physical screen and which is panned by moving the mouse to the edge
of the screen. If you don't want virtual desktop at a certain resolution,
you cannot have modes listed that are larger. Each color depth can have a
differently-sized virtual screen

Please answer the following question with either 'y' or 'n'.

    <para>A list of supported hardware is provided with each FreeBSD release
      in the FreeBSD Hardware Notes.  This document can usually be found in a

    <para>The following section covers basic installation troubleshooting,
      such as common problems people have reported.  There are also a few
      questions and answers for people wishing to dual-boot FreeBSD with
      &ms-dos;.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>What to Do If Something Goes Wrong</title>

      <para>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is
        impossible for probing to be 100% reliable, however, there are a
        few things you can do if it fails.</para>

      <para>Check the Hardware Notes document for your version of
        FreeBSD to make sure your hardware is
        supported.</para>

      <para>If your hardware is supported and you still experience
        lock-ups or other problems, reset your computer, and when the
        visual kernel configuration option is given, choose it.  This will
        allow you to go through your hardware and supply information to the
        system about it.  The kernel on the boot disks is configured
        assuming that most hardware devices are in their factory default
        configuration in terms of IRQs, IO addresses, and DMA channels.  If
        your hardware has been reconfigured, you will most likely need to
        use the configuration editor to tell FreeBSD where to find
        things.</para>

      <para>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present will
        cause a later probe for another device that is present to fail.  In
        that case, the probes for the conflicting driver(s) should be
        disabled.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Some installation problems can be avoided or alleviated
          by updating the firmware on various hardware components, most notably
          the motherboard.  The motherboard firmware may also be referred to
          as <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and most of the motherboard or computer
          manufactures have a website where the upgrades and upgrade information
          may be located.</para>

        <para>Most manufacturers strongly advise against upgrading the motherboard
          <acronym>BIOS</acronym> unless there is a good reason for doing so, which
          could possibly be a critical update of sorts.  The upgrade process
          <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, causing permanent damage to the
          <acronym>BIOS</acronym> chip.</para>
        </note>

      <warning>
        <para>Do not disable any drivers you will need during the
          installation, such as your screen (<devicename>sc0</devicename>).
	  If the installation wedges or fails mysteriously after leaving
	  the configuration editor, you have probably removed or changed
	  something you should not have.  Reboot and try again.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>In configuration mode, you can:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>List the device drivers installed in the kernel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Disable device drivers for hardware that is not present in
	    your system.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Change IRQs, DRQs, and IO port addresses used by a device
	    driver.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>After adjusting the kernel to match your hardware
        configuration, type <command>Q</command> to boot with the new
        settings.  Once the installation has completed, any changes you
        made in the configuration mode will be permanent so you do not have
        to reconfigure every time you boot.  It is still highly likely that
        you will eventually want to build a <link

      <title>Dealing with Existing &ms-dos; Partitions</title>

      <indexterm><primary>DOS</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Many users wish to install &os; on <acronym>PC</acronym>s inhabited by
	&microsoft; based operating systems.  For those instances, &os; has a
	utility known as <application>FIPS</application>.  This utility can be found
	in the <filename>tools</filename> directory on the install CD-ROM, or downloaded
	from one of various &os; mirrors.</para>

      <para>The <application>FIPS</application> utility allows you to split an
	existing &ms-dos; partition into two pieces, preserving the original
	partition and allowing you to install onto the second free piece.
	You first need to defragment your &ms-dos; partition using the &windows;;
	<application>Disk Defragmenter</application> utility (go into Explorer, right-click on
	the hard drive, and choose to defrag your hard drive), or use
	<application>Norton Disk Tools</application>.  Now you can run the
	<application>FIPS</application> utility.  It will prompt you for the rest of
	the information, just follow the on screen instructions.  Afterwards, you can
	reboot and install &os; on the new free slice.  See the <guimenuitem>Distributions</guimenuitem> menu
	for an estimate of how much free space you will need for the kind of
	installation you want.</para>

      <para>There is also a very useful product from PowerQuest
	(<ulink url="http://www.powerquest.com/">http://www.powerquest.com</ulink>) called
	<application>&partitionmagic;</application>.  This application has far more
	functionality than <application>FIPS</application>, and is highly recommended
	if you plan to add/remove operating systems often.  It does cost money, so if you
	plan to install &os; and keep it installed, <application>FIPS</application>
	will probably be fine for you.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using &ms-dos; and &windows; File Systems</title>

      <para>At this time, &os; does not support file systems compressed with the
	<application>Double Space&trade;</application> application.  Therefore the file
	system will need to be uncompressed before &os; can access the data.  This
	can be done by running the <application>Compression Agent</application>
	located in the <guimenuitem>Start</guimenuitem>&gt; <guimenuitem>Programs</guimenuitem> &gt;
	<guimenuitem>System Tools</guimenuitem> menu.</para>

      <para>&os; can support &ms-dos; based file systems.  This requires you use
	the &man.mount.msdos.8; command (in &os; 5.X, the command is &man.mount.msdosfs.8;)
	with the required parameters.  The utilities most common usage is:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount_msdos /dev/ad0s1 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>In this example, the &ms-dos; file system is located on the first partition of
	the primary hard disk.  Your situation may be different, check the output from
	the <command>dmesg</command>, and <command>mount</command> commands.  They should
	produce enough information too give an idea of the partition layout.</para>

      <note><para>Extended &ms-dos; file systems are usually mapped after the &os;
	partitions.  In other words, the slice number may be higher than the ones
	&os; is using.  For instance, the first &ms-dos; partition may be
	<filename>/dev/ad0s1</filename>, the &os; partition may be
	<filename>/dev/ad0s2</filename>, with the extended &ms-dos; partition being
	located on <filename>/dev/ad0s3</filename>.  To some, this can be confusing
	at first.</para></note>

      <para>NTFS partitions can also be mounted in a similar manner
	using the &man.mount.ntfs.8; command.</para>

      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>serial console</primary></indexterm>
      <para>This type of installation is called a <quote>headless
	install</quote>, because the machine that you are trying to install
	FreeBSD on either does not have a monitor attached to it, or does not
	even have a VGA output.  How is this possible you ask? Using a
        serial console.  A serial console is basically using another
        machine to act as the main display and keyboard for a
        system.  To do this, just follow the steps to create
        installation floppies, explained in <xref
        linkend="install-floppies">.</para>

      <para>To modify these floppies to boot into a serial console, follow
	these steps:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Enabling the Boot Floppies to Boot into a Serial Console</title>
  	    <indexterm>
	      <primary><command>mount</command></primary>
	    </indexterm>
	    <para>If you were to boot into the floppies that you just
	      made, FreeBSD would boot into its normal install mode.  We
	      want FreeBSD to boot into a serial console for our
	      install.  To do this, you have to mount the
	      <filename>kern.flp</filename> floppy onto your FreeBSD
	      system using the &man.mount.8; command.</para>

            <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/fd0 /mnt</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now that you have the floppy mounted, you must
	      change into the <filename role="directory">/mnt</filename> directory:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Here is where you must set the floppy to boot into a
	      serial console.  You have to make a file called
	      <filename>boot.config</filename> containing 
	      <literal>/boot/loader -h</literal>.  All this does is pass a flag to the bootloader to
	      boot into a serial console.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>echo "/boot/loader -h" > boot.config</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now that you have your floppy configured correctly,
	      you must unmount the floppy using the &man.umount.8;
	      command:</para>

            <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>umount /mnt</userinput></screen>

	    <para>Now you can remove the floppy from the floppy
	      drive.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Connecting Your Null Modem Cable</title>

  	    <indexterm><primary>null modem cable</primary></indexterm>
	    <para>You now need to connect a null modem cable between
	      the two machines.  Just connect the cable to the serial
	      ports of the 2 machines.  <emphasis>A normal serial cable
	      will not work here</emphasis>, you need a null modem
	      cable because it has some of the wires inside crossed
	      over.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Booting Up for the Install</title>

	    <para>It is now time to go ahead and start the install.  Put
	      the <filename>kern.flp</filename> floppy in the floppy
	      drive of the machine you are doing the headless install
	      on, and power on the machine.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <title>Connecting to Your Headless Machine</title>
	    <indexterm>
	      <primary><command>cu</command></primary>
	    </indexterm>
	    <para>Now you have to connect to that machine with

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cu -l /dev/cuaa0</userinput></screen>
	  </step>
      </procedure>

      <para>That's it! You should now be able to control the headless machine
	through your <command>cu</command> session.  It will ask you to
	put in the <filename>mfsroot.flp</filename>, and then it will come up
	with a selection of what kind of terminal to use.  Select the
	FreeBSD color console and proceed with your install!</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para>If you must install from floppy disk (which we suggest you
	do <emphasis>not</emphasis> do), either due to unsupported
	hardware or simply because you insist on doing things the hard
	way, you must first prepare some floppies for the installation.</para>

	<para>At a minimum, you will need as many 1.44&nbsp;MB or 1.2&nbsp;MB floppies
	  as it takes to hold all the files in the
	  <filename>bin</filename> (binary distribution) directory.  If
	  you are preparing the floppies from DOS, then they
	  <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> be formatted using the &ms-dos;
	  <command>FORMAT</command> command.  If you are using &windows;,
	  use Explorer to format the disks (right-click on the
	  <devicename>A:</devicename> drive, and select <quote>Format</quote>.</para>

	<para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> trust factory pre-formatted
	  floppies.  Format them again yourself, just to be sure.  Many
	  problems reported by our users in the past have resulted from
	  the use of improperly formatted media, which is why we are
	  making a point of it now.</para>

	<para>If you are creating the floppies on another FreeBSD machine,
	  a format is still not a bad idea, though you do not need to put
	  a DOS filesystem on each floppy.  You can use the
	  <command>disklabel</command> and <command>newfs</command>
	  commands to put a UFS filesystem on them instead, as the
	  following sequence of commands (for a 3.5" 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy)
	  illustrates:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fdformat -f 1440 fd0.1440</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>disklabel -w -r fd0.1440 floppy3</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -t 2 -u 18 -l 1 -i 65536 /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Use <literal>fd0.1200</literal> and
	    <literal>floppy5</literal> for 5.25" 1.2&nbsp;MB disks.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Then you can mount and write to them like any other
	  filesystem.</para>

	<para>After you have formatted the floppies, you will need to copy
	  the files to them.  The distribution files are split into chunks
	  conveniently sized so that five of them will fit on a conventional
	  1.44&nbsp;MB floppy.  Go through all your floppies, packing as many
	  files as will fit on each one, until you have all of the
	  distributions you want packed up in this fashion.  Each
	  distribution should go into a subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.:
	  <filename>a:\bin\bin.aa</filename>,
	  <filename>a:\bin\bin.ab</filename>, and so on.</para>

	<para>Once you come to the Media screen during the install
	  process, select <quote>Floppy</quote> and you will be prompted
	  for the rest.</para>

	<para>To prepare for an installation from an &ms-dos; partition,
	  copy the files from the distribution into a directory
          called <filename>freebsd</filename> in the root directory of the
	  partition.  For example, <filename>c:\freebsd</filename>.  The

	  reproduced within this directory, so we suggest using the DOS
	  <command>xcopy</command> command if you are copying it from a CD.
	  For example, to prepare for a minimal installation of
	  FreeBSD:</para>

	<screen><prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>md c:\freebsd</userinput>
<prompt>C:\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>xcopy e:\bin c:\freebsd\bin\ /s</userinput>

	  distribution from <ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">ftp.FreeBSD.org</ulink>.
	  Each distribution is in its own directory; for example, the

	<para>For as many distributions you wish to install from an &ms-dos;

	</indexterm>
	<para>Installing from tape is probably the easiest method, short
	  of an online FTP install or CDROM install.  The installation
	  program expects the files to be simply tarred onto the tape.
	  After getting all of the distribution files you are interested
	  in, simply tar them onto the tape:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /freebsd/distdir</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tar cvf /dev/rwt0 dist1 ... dist2</userinput></screen>

	<para>When you perform the installation, you should make
	  sure that you leave enough room in some temporary directory
	  (which you will be allowed to choose) to accommodate the
	  <emphasis>full</emphasis> contents of the tape you have created.
	  Due to the non-random access nature of tapes, this method of
	  installation requires quite a bit of temporary storage.  You
	  should expect to require as much temporary storage as you have
	  data written on tape.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>When starting the installation, the tape must be in the

	</indexterm>
	<para>There are three types of network installations available.
	  Serial port (SLIP or PPP), Parallel port (PLIP (laplink cable)),
	  or Ethernet (a standard Ethernet controller (includes some
	  PCMCIA)).</para>

	<para>The SLIP support is rather primitive, and limited primarily
	  to hard-wired links, such as a serial cable running between a
	  laptop computer and another computer.  The link should be
	  hard-wired as the SLIP installation does not currently offer a
	  dialing capability; that facility is provided with the PPP
	  utility, which should be used in preference to SLIP whenever
	  possible.</para>

	<para>If you are using a modem, then PPP is almost certainly
	  your only choice.  Make sure that you have your service
	  provider's information handy as you will need to know it fairly
	  early in the installation process.</para>  

	<para>If you use PAP or CHAP to connect your ISP (in other words, if
	  you can connect to the ISP in &windows; without using a script), then
	  all you will need to do is type in <command>dial</command> at the
	  <application>ppp</application> prompt.  Otherwise, you will need to
	  know how to dial your ISP using the <quote>AT commands</quote>
	  specific to your modem, as the PPP dialer provides only a very
	  simple terminal emulator.  Please refer to the user-ppp <link
	  linkend="userppp">handbook</link> and <ulink
	  url="../faq/ppp.html">FAQ</ulink> entries for further information.
	  If you have problems, logging can be directed to the screen using
	  the command <command>set log local ...</command>.</para>

	<para>If a hard-wired connection to another FreeBSD (2.0-R or
	  later) machine is available, you might also consider installing
	  over a <quote>laplink</quote> parallel port cable.  The data rate
	  over the parallel port is much higher than what is typically
	  possible over a serial line (up to 50&nbsp;kbytes/sec), thus resulting
	  in a quicker installation.</para>

	<para>Finally, for the fastest possible network installation, an
	  Ethernet adapter is always a good choice!  FreeBSD supports most
	  common PC Ethernet cards; a table of supported cards (and their
	  required settings) is provided in the Hardware Notes for each
	  release of FreeBSD.  If you are using one of the supported PCMCIA
	  Ethernet cards, also be sure that it is plugged in
	  <emphasis>before</emphasis> the laptop is powered on!  FreeBSD does
	  not, unfortunately, currently support hot insertion of PCMCIA cards
	  during installation.</para>

	<para>You will also need to know your IP address on the network,
	  the netmask value for your address class, and the name of your
	  machine.  If you are installing over a PPP connection and do not
	  have a static IP, fear not, the IP address can be dynamically
	  assigned by your ISP.  Your system administrator can tell you
	  which values to use for your particular network setup.  If you
	  will be referring to other hosts by name rather than IP address,
	  you will also need a name server and possibly the address of a
	  gateway (if you are using PPP, it is your provider's IP address)
	  to use in talking to it.  If you want to install by FTP via a
	  HTTP proxy, you will also need the proxy's address.
	  If you do not know the answers to all or most of these questions,
	  then you should really probably talk to your system administrator
	  or ISP <emphasis>before</emphasis> trying this type of
	  installation.</para>

	    <secondary>network</secondary>
	    <tertiary>NFS</tertiary>
	  </indexterm>
	  <para>The NFS installation is fairly straight-forward.  Simply
	    copy the FreeBSD distribution files you want onto an NFS server
	    and then point the NFS media selection at it.</para>

	  <para>If this server supports only <quote>privileged port</quote>
	    (as is generally the default for Sun workstations), you will
	    need to set this option in the Options menu before
	    installation can proceed.</para>

	  <para>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which suffers
	    from very slow transfer rates, you may also wish to toggle the
	    appropriate Options flag.</para>

	  <para>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must
	    support subdir mounts, for example, if your FreeBSD&nbsp;&rel.current; distribution
	    directory lives on:
	    <filename>ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, then
	    <hostid>ziggy</hostid> will have to allow the direct mounting
	    of <filename>/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</filename>, not just
	    <filename>/usr</filename> or
	    <filename>/usr/archive/stuff</filename>.</para>

	  <para>In FreeBSD's <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file, this
	    is controlled by the <option>-alldirs</option> options.  Other NFS
	    servers may have different conventions.  If you are getting
	    <quote>permission denied</quote> messages from the server, then
	    it is likely that you do not have this enabled
	    properly.</para>
