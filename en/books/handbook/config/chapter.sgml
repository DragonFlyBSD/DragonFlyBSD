    <para>One of the important aspects of &os; is system configuration.
      Correct system configuration will help prevent headaches during future upgrades.
      This chapter will explain much of the &os; configuration process,
      including some of the parameters which
      can be set to tune a &os; system.

	<title>Base Partitions</title>

	<para>When laying out file systems with &man.disklabel.8;
	  or &man.sysinstall.8;, remember that hard
	  drives transfer data faster from the outer
	  tracks to the inner.
	  Thus smaller and heavier-accessed file systems
	  should be closer to the outside of the drive, while
	  larger partitions like <filename>/usr</filename> should be placed
	  toward the inner.  It is a good idea to create
	  partitions in a similar order to: root, swap,
	  <filename>/var</filename>, <filename>/usr</filename>.</para>

	<para>The size of <filename>/var</filename>
	  reflects the intended machine usage.
	  <filename>/var</filename> is used to hold
	  mailboxes, log files, and printer spools.  Mailboxes and log
	  files can grow to unexpected sizes depending
	  on how many users exist and how long log
	  files are kept.  Most users would never require a gigabyte,
	  but remember that <filename>/var/tmp</filename>
	  must be large enough to contain packages.
	  </para>

	<para>The <filename>/usr</filename> partition holds much
	  of the files required to support the system, the &man.ports.7;
	  collection (recommended) and the source code (optional).  Both
	  of which are optional at install time.
	  At least 2 gigabytes would be recommended for this partition.</para>

	<para>When selecting partition sizes, keep the space
	  requirements in mind.  Running out of space in
	  one partition while barely using another can be a
	  hassle.</para>

	<note><para>Some users have found that &man.sysinstall.8;'s
	    <literal>Auto-defaults</literal> partition sizer will
	    sometimes select smaller than adequate <filename>/var</filename>
	    and <filename>/</filename> partitions.  Partition wisely and
	    generously.</para></note>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="swap-design">
	<title>Swap Partition</title>

	<indexterm><primary>swap sizing</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>swap partition</primary></indexterm>

	<para>As a rule of thumb, the swap partition should be
	  about double the size of system memory (RAM).  For example,
	  if the machine has 128&nbsp;megabytes of memory,
	  the swap file should be 256&nbsp;megabytes.  Systems with
	  less memory may perform better with more swap.
	  Less than 256&nbsp;megabytes of swap is not recommended and
	  memory expansion should be considered.
	  The kernel's VM paging algorithms are tuned to
	  perform best when the swap partition is at least two times the
	  size of main memory.  Configuring too little swap can lead to
	  inefficiencies in the VM page scanning code and might create
	  issues later if more memory is added.</para>

	<para>On larger systems with multiple SCSI disks (or
	  multiple IDE disks operating on different controllers), it is
	  recommend that a swap is configured on each drive (up
	  to four drives).  The swap partitions should be
	  approximately the same size.  The kernel can handle arbitrary
	  sizes but internal data structures scale to 4 times the
	  largest swap partition.  Keeping the swap partitions near the
	  same size will allow the kernel to optimally stripe swap space
	  across disks.
	  Large swap sizes are fine, even if swap is not
	  used much.  It might be easier to recover
	  from a runaway program before being forced to reboot.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Why Partition?</title>

	<para>Several users think a single large partition will be fine,
	  but there are several reasons why this is a bad idea.
	  First, each partition has different operational
	  characteristics and separating them allows the file system to
	  tune accordingly.  For example, the root
	  and <filename>/usr</filename> partitions are read-mostly, without
	  much writing.  While a lot of reading and writing could
	  occur in <filename>/var</filename> and
	  <filename>/var/tmp</filename>.</para>

	<para>By properly partitioning a system, fragmentation
	  introduced in the smaller write heavy partitions
	  will not bleed over into the mostly-read partitions.
	  Keeping the write-loaded partitions closer to
	  the disk's edge,
	  will
	  increase I/O performance in the partitions where it occurs
	  the most.  Now while I/O
	  performance in the larger partitions may be needed,
	  shifting them more toward the edge of the disk will not
	  lead to a significant performance improvement over moving
	  <filename>/var</filename> to the edge.
	  Finally, there are safety concerns.  A smaller, neater root
	  partition which is mostly read-only has a greater
	  chance of surviving a bad crash.</para>

    <title>Core Configuration</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>rc files</primary>
      <secondary><filename>rc.conf</filename></secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The principal location for system configuration information
      is within <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This file
      contains a wide range of configuration information, principally
      used at system startup to configure the system.  Its name
      directly implies this; it is configuration information for the
      <filename>rc*</filename> files.</para>

    <para>An administrator should make entries in the
      <filename>rc.conf</filename> file to
      override the default settings from
      <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename>.  The defaults file
      should not be copied verbatim to <filename>/etc</filename> - it
      contains default values, not examples.  All system-specific
      changes should be made in the <filename>rc.conf</filename>
      file itself.</para>

    <para>A number of strategies may be applied in clustered
      applications to separate site-wide configuration from
      system-specific configuration in order to keep administration
      overhead down.  The recommended approach is to place site-wide
      configuration into another file,
      such as <filename>/etc/rc.conf.site</filename>, and then include
      this file into <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, which will
      contain only system-specific information.</para>

    <para>As <filename>rc.conf</filename> is read by &man.sh.1; it is
      trivial to achieve this.  For example:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>rc.conf:</para>
<programlisting>	. rc.conf.site
	hostname="node15.example.com"
	network_interfaces="fxp0 lo0"
	ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1"</programlisting></listitem>
      <listitem><para>rc.conf.site:</para>
<programlisting>	defaultrouter="10.1.1.254"
	saver="daemon"
	blanktime="100"</programlisting></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <filename>rc.conf.site</filename> file can then be
      distributed to every system using <command>rsync</command> or a
      similar program, while the <filename>rc.conf</filename> file
      remains unique.</para>

    <para>Upgrading the system using &man.sysinstall.8;
      or <command>make world</command> will not overwrite the
      <filename>rc.conf</filename>
      file, so system configuration information will not be lost.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="configtuning-appconfig">
    <title>Application Configuration</title>

    <para>Typically, installed applications have their own
      configuration files, with their own syntax, etc.  It is
      important that these files be kept separate from the base
      system, so that they may be easily located and managed by the
      package management tools.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>/usr/local/etc</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Typically, these files are installed in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc</filename>.  In the case where an
      application has a large number of configuration files, a
      subdirectory will be created to hold them.</para>

    <para>Normally, when a port or package is installed, sample
      configuration files are also installed.  These are usually
      identified with a <filename>.default</filename> suffix.  If there
      are no existing
      configuration files for the application, they will be created by
      copying the <filename>.default</filename> files.</para>

    <para>For example, consider the contents of the directory
    <filename>/usr/local/etc/apache</filename>:</para>

<literallayout class="monospaced">-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2184 May 20  1998 access.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2184 May 20  1998 access.conf.default
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   9555 May 20  1998 httpd.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   9555 May 20  1998 httpd.conf.default
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  12205 May 20  1998 magic
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  12205 May 20  1998 magic.default
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2700 May 20  1998 mime.types
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2700 May 20  1998 mime.types.default
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   7980 May 20  1998 srm.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   7933 May 20  1998 srm.conf.default</literallayout>

    <para>The file sizes show that only the <filename>srm.conf</filename>
      file has been changed.  A later update of the <application>Apache</application> port would not
      overwrite this changed file.</para>

  <sect1 id="configtuning-starting-services">
    <title>Starting Services</title>

    <indexterm><primary>services</primary></indexterm>

    <para>It is common for a system to host a number of services.
      These may be started in several different fashions, each having
      different advantages.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Software installed from a port or the packages collection
      will often place a script in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> which is invoked at
      system startup with a <option>start</option> argument, and at
      system shutdown with a <option>stop</option> argument.
      This is the recommended way for
      starting system-wide services that are to be run as
      <username>root</username>, or that
      expect to be started as <username>root</username>.
      These scripts are registered as
      part of the installation of the package, and will be removed
      when the package is removed.</para>

    <para>A generic startup script in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> looks like:</para>

    <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
echo -n ' FooBar'

case "$1" in
start)
        /usr/local/bin/foobar
        ;;
stop)
        kill -9 `cat /var/run/foobar.pid`
        ;;
*)
        echo "Usage: `basename $0` {start|stop}" >&2
        exit 64
        ;;
esac

exit 0
    </programlisting>

    <para>The startup scripts of &os; will look in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> for scripts that have an
      <literal>.sh</literal> extension and are executable by
      <username>root</username>.  Those scripts that are found are called with
      an option <option>start</option> at startup, and <option>stop</option>
      at shutdown to allow them to carry out their purpose.  So if you wanted
      the above sample script to be picked up and run at the proper time during
      system startup, you should save it to a file called
      <filename>FooBar.sh</filename> in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> and make sure it is
      executable.  You can make a shell script executable with &man.chmod.1;
      as shown below:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chmod 755 <replaceable>FooBar.sh</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>Some services expect to be invoked by &man.inetd.8; when a
      connection is received on a suitable port.  This is common for
      mail reader servers (POP and IMAP, etc.).  These services are
      enabled by editing the file <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>.
      See &man.inetd.8; for details on editing this file.</para>

    <para>Some additional system services may not be covered by the
      toggles in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  These are
      traditionally enabled by placing the command(s) to invoke them
      in <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>.  As of &os;&nbsp;3.1 there
      is no default <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>; if it is
      created by the administrator it will however be honored in the
      normal fashion.  Note that <filename>rc.local</filename> is
      generally regarded as the location of last resort; if there is a
      better place to start a service, do it there.</para>

    <note><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> place any commands in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  To start daemons, or
      run any commands at boot time, place a script in
      <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename> instead.</para>
    </note>

    <para>It is also possible to use the &man.cron.8; daemon to start
      system services.  This approach has a number of advantages, not
      least being that because &man.cron.8; runs these processes as the
      owner of the <command>crontab</command>, services may be started
      and maintained by non-<username>root</username> users.</para>

    <para>This takes advantage of a feature of &man.cron.8;: the
      time specification may be replaced by <literal>@reboot</literal>,
      which will
      cause the job to be run when &man.cron.8; is started shortly after
      system boot.</para>

    <title>Configuring the <command>cron</command> Utility</title>

    <indexterm><primary>cron</primary>
      <secondary>configuration</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>One of the most useful utilities in &os; is &man.cron.8;.  The
      <command>cron</command> utility runs in the background and constantly
      checks the <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> file.  The <command>cron</command>
      utility also checks the <filename>/var/cron/tabs</filename> directory, in
      search of new <filename>crontab</filename> files.  These
      <filename>crontab</filename> files store information about specific
      functions which <command>cron</command> is supposed to perform at
      certain times.</para>

    <para>The <command>cron</command> utility uses two different
      types of configuration files, the system crontab and user crontabs. The
      only difference between these two formats is the sixth field.  In the
      system crontab, the sixth field is the name of a user for the command
      to run as. This gives the system crontab the ability to run commands
      as any user. In a user crontab, the sixth field is the command to run,
      and all commands run as the user who created the crontab; this is an
      important security feature.</para>

    <note>
      <para>User crontabs allow individual users to schedule tasks without the 
        need for root privileges. Commands in a user's crontab run with the 
        permissions of the user who owns the crontab.</para>

      <para>The <username>root</username> user can have a user crontab just like
        any other user. This one is different from
        <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> (the system crontab). Because of the
        system crontab, there's usually no need to create a user crontab
        for <username>root</username>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Let us take a look at the <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> file
      (the system crontab):</para>


    <programlisting># /etc/crontab - root's crontab for &os;

      <callout arearefs="co-comments">
	<para>Like most &os; configuration files, the <literal>#</literal>
	  character represents a comment.  A comment can be placed in
	  the file as a reminder of what and why a desired action is performed.

	  be interpreted as part of the command; they must be on a new line.
	  Blank lines are ignored.</para>
      </callout>

      <callout arearefs="co-env">

	  omitted, <command>cron</command> will use the default, which is

      <callout arearefs="co-field-descr">

	  <literal>who</literal>, and <literal>command</literal>.  These
	  are almost all self explanatory.  <literal>minute</literal> is the time in minutes the
	  command will be run.  <literal>hour</literal> is similar to the <literal>minute</literal> option, just in
	  hours.  <literal>mday</literal> stands for day of the month.  <literal>month</literal> is similar to <literal>hour</literal>
	  and <literal>minute</literal>, as it designates the month.  The <literal>wday</literal> option stands for
	  day of the week.  All these fields must be numeric values, and follow
	  the twenty-four hour clock.  The <literal>who</literal> field is special,
	  and only exists in the <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> file.
	  This field specifies which user the command should be run as.
	  When a user installs his or her <filename>crontab</filename> file, they
	  will not have this option. Finally, the <literal>command</literal> option is listed.

    <title>Using rc under FreeBSD 5.X</title>

    <indexterm><primary>rcNG</primary></indexterm>

    <para>&os; has recently integrated the NetBSD
      <filename>rc.d</filename> system for system initialization.
      Users should notice the files listed in the
      <filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> directory.  Many of these files
      are for basic services which can be controlled with the
      <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option>,
      and <option>restart</option> options.
      For instance, &man.sshd.8; can be restarted with the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/sshd restart</userinput></screen>

    <para>This procedure is similar for other services.  Of course,
      services are usually started automatically as specified in
      &man.rc.conf.5;.  For example, enabling the Network Address
      Translation daemon at startup is as simple as adding the
      following line to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>natd_enable="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>If a <option>natd_enable="NO"</option> line is already
       present, then simply change the <option>NO</option> to
       <option>YES</option>.  The rc scripts will automatically load
       any other dependent services during the next reboot, as
       described below.</para>

    <para>Since the <filename>rc.d</filename> system is primarily
      intended to start/stop services at system startup/shutdown time,
      the standard <option>start</option>,
      <option>stop</option> and <option>restart</option> options will only
      perform their action if the appropriate
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> variables are set.  For
      instance the above <command>sshd restart</command> command will
      only work if <varname>sshd_enable</varname> is set to
      <option>YES</option> in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  To
      <option>start</option>, <option>stop</option> or
      <option>restart</option> a service regardless of the settings in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the commands should be
      prefixed with <quote>force</quote>.  For instance to restart
      <command>sshd</command> regardless of the current
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> setting, execute the following
      command:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/sshd forcerestart</userinput></screen>

    <para>It is easy to check if a service is enabled in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> by running the appropriate
      <filename>rc.d</filename> script with the option
      <option>rcvar</option>.  Thus, an administrator can check that
      <command>sshd</command> is in fact enabled in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> by running:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/sshd rcvar</userinput>
# sshd
$sshd_enable=YES</screen>

    <note>
      <para>The second line (<literal># sshd</literal>) is the output
        from the <command>sshd</command> command, not a <username>root</username>
        console.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To determine if a service is running, a
      <option>status</option> option is available.  For instance to
      verify that <command>sshd</command> is actually started:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/etc/rc.d/sshd status</userinput>
sshd is running as pid 433.</screen>

    <para>It is also possible to <option>reload</option> a service.
      This will attempt to send a signal to an individual service, forcing the
      service to reload its configuration files.  In most cases this
      means sending the service a <literal>SIGHUP</literal>
      signal.</para>

    <para>The <application>rcNG</application> structure is not only used for network services, it also
      contributes to most of the system initialization.  For
      instance, consider the <filename>bgfsck</filename> file.  When
      this script is executed, it will print out the following
      message:</para>

    <screen>Starting background file system checks in 60 seconds.</screen>

    <para>Therefore this file is used for background file system
      checks, which are done only during system initialization.</para>

    <para>Many system services depend on other services to function
      properly.  For example, NIS and other RPC-based services may
      fail to start until after the <command>rpcbind</command>
      (portmapper) service has started.  To resolve this issue,
      information about dependencies and other meta-data is included
      in the comments at the top of each startup script.  The
      &man.rcorder.8; program is then used to parse these comments
      during system initialization to determine the order in which
      system services should be invoked to satisfy the dependencies.
      The following words may be included at the top of each startup
      file:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>PROVIDE</literal>: Specifies the services this file provides.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>REQUIRE</literal>: Lists services which are required for this
	  service.  This file will run <emphasis>after</emphasis>
	  the specified services.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>BEFORE</literal>: Lists services which depend on this service.
	  This file will run <emphasis>before</emphasis>
	  the specified services.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>KEYWORD: &os; or NetBSD.  This is used for *BSD dependent features.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By using this method, an administrator can easily control system
      services without the hassle of <quote>runlevels</quote> like
      some other &unix; operating systems.</para>

    <para>Additional information about the &os; 5.X
      <filename>rc.d</filename> system can be found in the &man.rc.8;
      and &man.rc.subr.8; manual pages.</para>

    <title>Setting Up Network Interface Cards</title>

    <indexterm><primary>network card configuration</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Nowadays we can not think about a computer without thinking
      about a network connection.  Adding and configuring a network
      card is a common task for any &os; administrator.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Locating the Correct Driver</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>network card configuration</primary>
	<secondary>locating the driver</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Before you begin, you should know the model of the card
	you have, the chip it uses, and whether it is a PCI or ISA card.
	&os; supports a wide variety of both PCI and ISA cards.
	Check the Hardware Compatibility List for your release to see
	if your card is supported.</para>

      <para>Once you are sure your card is supported, you need
	to determine the proper driver for the card.  The file
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT</filename> will give you
	the list of network interfaces drivers with some information
	about the supported chipsets/cards.  If you have doubts about
	which driver is the correct one, read the manual page of the
	driver.  The manual page will give you more information about
	the supported hardware and even the possible problems that
	could occur.</para>

      <para>If you own a common card, most of the time you will not
	have to look very hard for a driver.  Drivers for common
	network cards are present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	kernel, so your card should show up during boot, like so:</para>

<screen>dc0: &lt;82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX&gt; port 0xa000-0xa0ff mem 0xd3800000-0xd38
000ff irq 15 at device 11.0 on pci0
dc0: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:da
miibus0: &lt;MII bus&gt; on dc0
ukphy0: &lt;Generic IEEE 802.3u media interface&gt; on miibus0
ukphy0:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto
dc1: &lt;82c169 PNIC 10/100BaseTX&gt; port 0x9800-0x98ff mem 0xd3000000-0xd30
000ff irq 11 at device 12.0 on pci0
dc1: Ethernet address: 00:a0:cc:da:da:db
miibus1: &lt;MII bus&gt; on dc1
ukphy1: &lt;Generic IEEE 802.3u media interface&gt; on miibus1
ukphy1:  10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto</screen>

      <para>In this example, we see that two cards using the &man.dc.4;
	driver are present on the system.</para>

      <para>To use your network card, you will need to load the proper
	driver.  This may be accomplished in one of two ways.  The
	easiest way is to simply load a kernel module for your network
	card with &man.kldload.8;.  A module is not available for all
	network card drivers (ISA cards and cards using the &man.ed.4;
	driver, for example).  Alternatively, you may statically compile
	the support for your card into your kernel.  Check
	<filename>/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT</filename> and the
	manual page of the driver to know what to add in your kernel
	configuration file.  For more information about recompiling your
	kernel, please see <xref linkend="kernelconfig">.  If your card
	was detected at boot by your kernel (<filename>GENERIC</filename>)
	you do not have to build a new kernel.</para>

	<primary>Network card configuration</primary>
	<secondary>configuration</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Once the right driver is loaded for the network card, the
	card needs to be configured.  As with many other things, the
	network card may have been configured at installation time by
	<application>sysinstall</application>.</para>

      <para>To display the configuration for the network interfaces on
	your system, enter the following command:</para>

<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>ifconfig</userinput>

tun0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500</screen>

      <note>
	<para>Old versions of &os; may require the <option>-a</option>
	  option following &man.ifconfig.8;, for more details about the
	  correct syntax of &man.ifconfig.8;, please refer to the manual
	  page.  Note also that entries concerning IPv6
	  (<literal>inet6</literal> etc.) were omitted in this

      <para>&os; uses the driver name followed by the order in

      <para>it would indicate the card has not been configured.</para>

      <para>To configure your card, you need <username>root</username>
	privileges.  The network card configuration can be done from the
	command line with &man.ifconfig.8; but you would have to do it
	after each reboot of the system.  The file
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> is where to add the network
	card's configuration.</para>

      <para>Open <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> in your favorite
	editor.  You need to add a line for each network card present on
	the system, for example in our case, we added these lines:</para>

<programlisting>ifconfig_dc0="inet 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
ifconfig_dc1="inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 media 10baseT/UTP"</programlisting>

      <para>You have to replace <devicename>dc0</devicename>,
	<devicename>dc1</devicename>, and so on, with
	the correct device for your cards, and the addresses with the
	proper ones.  You should read the card driver and
	&man.ifconfig.8; manual pages for more details about the allowed
	options and also &man.rc.conf.5; manual page for more
	information on the syntax of
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>If you configured the network during installation, some
	lines about the network card(s) may be already present.  Double
	check <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> before adding any
	lines.</para>

      <para>You will also have to edit the file
	<filename>/etc/hosts</filename> to add the names and the IP
	addresses of various machines of the LAN, if they are not already
	there.  For more information please refer to &man.hosts.5;
	and to <filename>/usr/share/examples/etc/hosts</filename>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Testing and Troubleshooting</title>

      <para>Once you have made the necessary changes in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, you should reboot your
	system.  This will allow the change(s) to the interface(s) to
	be applied, and verify that the system restarts without any
	configuration errors.</para>

      <para>Once the system has been rebooted, you should test the

	<title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>network card configuration</primary>
	<secondary>troubleshooting</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Troubleshooting hardware and software configurations is always
	a pain, and a pain which can be alleviated by checking the simple
	things first.  Is your network cable plugged in?  Have you properly
	configured the network services?  Did you configure the firewall
	correctly?  Is the card you are using supported by &os;?  Always
	check the hardware notes before sending off a bug report.  Update
	your version of &os; to the latest STABLE version.  Check the
	mailing list archives, or perhaps search the Internet.</para>

      <para>If the card works, yet performance is poor, it would be
	worthwhile to read over the &man.tuning.7; manual page.  You
	can also check the network configuration as incorrect network
	settings can cause slow connections.</para>

      <para>Some users experience one or two <quote>device
	timeouts</quote>, which is normal for some cards.  If they
	continue, or are bothersome, you may wish to be sure the
	device is not conflicting with another device.  Double check
	the cable connections.  Perhaps you may just need to get
	another card.</para>

      <para>At times, users see a few <errorname>watchdog timeout</errorname>
	errors.  The first thing to do here is to check your network
	cable. Many cards require a PCI slot which supports Bus
	Mastering. On some old motherboards, only one PCI slot allows
	it (usually slot 0). Check the network card and the
	motherboard documentation to determine if that may be the
	problem.</para>

      <para><errorname>No route to host</errorname> messages occur if the

    <title>Virtual Hosts</title>

    <indexterm><primary>virtual hosts</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>IP aliases</primary></indexterm>

    <para>A very common use of &os; is virtual site hosting, where
      one server appears to the network as many servers.  This is
      achieved by assigning multiple network addresses to a single
      interface.</para>

    <para>A given network interface has one <quote>real</quote> address,
      and may have any number of <quote>alias</quote> addresses.
      These aliases are
      normally added by placing alias entries in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>An alias entry for the interface <devicename>fxp0</devicename>
      looks like:</para>

<programlisting>ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"</programlisting>

    <para>Note that alias entries must start with alias0 and proceed
      upwards in order, (for example, _alias1, _alias2, and so on).
      The configuration process will stop at the first missing number.
    </para>

    <para>The calculation of alias netmasks is important, but
      fortunately quite simple.  For a given interface, there must be
      one address which correctly represents the network's netmask.
      Any other addresses which fall within this network must have a
      netmask of all <literal>1</literal>s.</para>

    <para>For example, consider the case where the
      <devicename>fxp0</devicename> interface is
      connected to two networks, the <hostid role="ipaddr">10.1.1.0</hostid>
      network with a netmask of <hostid role="netmask">255.255.255.0</hostid>
      and the <hostid role="ipaddr">202.0.75.16</hostid> network with
      a netmask of <hostid role="netmask">255.255.255.240</hostid>.
      We want the system to appear at <hostid role="ipaddr">10.1.1.1</hostid>
      through <hostid role="ipaddr">10.1.1.5</hostid> and at
      <hostid role="ipaddr">202.0.75.17</hostid> through
      <hostid role="ipaddr">202.0.75.20</hostid>.</para>

    <para>The following entries configure the adapter correctly for
      this arrangement:</para>

<programlisting> ifconfig_fxp0="inet 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"

    <para>In some cases it may be desirable to modify read-only &man.sysctl.8;
      values.  While this is not recommended, it is also sometimes unavoidable.</para>

    <para>For instance on some laptop models the &man.cardbus.4; device will
      not probe memory ranges, and fail with errors which look similar to:</para>

    <screen>cbb0: Could not map register memory
device_probe_and_attach: cbb0 attach returned 12</screen>

    <para>Cases like the one above usually require the modification of some
      default &man.sysctl.8; settings which are set read only.  To overcome
      these situations a user can put &man.sysctl.8; <quote>OIDs</quote>
      in their local <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  Default
      settings are located in the <filename>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</filename>

    <para>Fixing the problem mentioned above would require a user to set
      <option>hw.pci.allow_unsupported_io_range=1</option> in the aforementioned
      file.  Now &man.cardbus.4; will work properly.</para>

	<para>The <varname>vfs.vmiodirenable</varname> sysctl variable
	  may be set to either 0 (off) or 1 (on); it is 1 by default.
	  This variable controls how directories are cached by the
	  system.  Most directories are small, using just a single
	  fragment (typically 1&nbsp;K) in the file system and less
	  (typically 512&nbsp;bytes) in the buffer cache.
	  However, when operating in the default mode the buffer
	  cache will only cache a fixed number of directories even if
	  you have a huge amount of memory.  Turning on this sysctl
	  allows the buffer cache to use the VM Page Cache to cache the
	  directories, making all the memory available for caching
	  directories.  However,

 	  Note that setting too high a value (exceeding the buffer cache's

 	<para>The <varname>vm.swap_idle_enabled</varname> sysctl variable
 	  is useful in large multi-user systems where you have lots of
 	  users entering and leaving the system and lots of idle processes.
 	  Such systems tend to generate a great deal of continuous pressure

 	  the swapout hysteresis (in idle seconds) via
 	  <varname>vm.swap_idle_threshold1</varname> and
 	  <varname>vm.swap_idle_threshold2</varname> allows you to depress
 	  the priority of memory pages associated with idle processes more
 	  quickly then the normal pageout algorithm.  This gives a helping
 	  hand to the pageout daemon.  Do not turn this option on unless
 	  you need it, because the tradeoff you are making is essentially
 	  pre-page memory sooner rather than later; thus eating more swap
 	  and disk bandwidth.  In a small system this option will have a
 	  determinable effect but in a large system that is already doing
 	  moderate paging this option allows the VM system to stage whole

	<para>&os;&nbsp;4.3 flirted with turning off IDE write caching.
	  This reduced write bandwidth to IDE disks but was considered
	  necessary due to serious data consistency issues introduced
	  by hard drive vendors.  The problem is that IDE
	  drives lie about when a write completes.  With IDE write
	  caching turned on, IDE hard drives not only write data
	  to disk out of order, but will sometimes delay writing some
	  blocks indefinitely when under heavy disk loads.  A crash or
	  power failure may cause serious file system corruption.
	  &os;'s default was changed to be safe.  Unfortunately, the
	  result was such a huge performance loss that we changed
	  write caching back to on by default after the release.  You
	  should check the default on your system by observing the
	  <varname>hw.ata.wc</varname> sysctl variable.  If IDE write
	  caching is turned off, you can turn it back on by setting
	  the kernel variable back to 1.  This must be done from the

      <para>The &man.tunefs.8; program can be used to fine-tune a

	now we are only concerned with toggling Soft Updates on and
	off, which is done by:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>tunefs -n enable /filesystem</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>tunefs -n disable /filesystem</userinput></screen>

      <para>A filesystem cannot be modified with &man.tunefs.8; while

      <para>Soft Updates drastically improves meta-data performance, mainly
        file creation and deletion, through the use of a memory cache.  We
        recommend to use Soft Updates on all of your file systems.  There
        are two downsides to Soft Updates that you should be aware of:  First,
        Soft Updates guarantees filesystem consistency in the case of a crash
        but could very easily be several seconds (even a minute!) behind
        updating the physical disk.  If your system crashes you may lose more
        work than otherwise.  Secondly, Soft Updates delays the freeing of
        filesystem blocks.  If you have a filesystem (such as the root
	filesystem) which is almost full, performing a major update, such as
        <command>make installworld</command>, can cause the filesystem to run
	out of space and the update to fail.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>More Details about Soft Updates</title>

	<indexterm>
	  <primary>Soft Updates</primary>
	  <secondary>details</secondary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>There are two traditional approaches to writing a file
	  systems meta-data back to disk.  (Meta-data updates are
	  updates to non-content data like inodes or
	  directories.)</para>

	<para>Historically, the default behavior was to write out
	  meta-data updates synchronously.  If a directory had been
	  changed, the system waited until the change was actually
	  written to disk.  The file data buffers (file contents) were
	  passed through the buffer cache and backed up
	  to disk later on asynchronously.  The advantage of this
	  implementation is that it operates safely.  If there is
	  a failure during an update, the meta-data are always in a
	  consistent state.  A file is either created completely
	  or not at all.  If the data blocks of a file did not find
	  their way out of the buffer cache onto the disk by the time
	  of the crash, &man.fsck.8; is able to recognize this and
	  repair the filesystem by setting the file length to
	  0.  Additionally, the implementation is clear and simple.
	  The disadvantage is that meta-data changes are slow.  An
	  <command>rm -r</command>, for instance, touches all the files
	  in a directory sequentially, but each directory
	  change (deletion of a file) will be written synchronously
	  to the disk.  This includes updates to the directory itself,
	  to the inode table, and possibly to indirect blocks
	  allocated by the file.  Similar considerations apply for
	  unrolling large hierarchies (<command>tar -x</command>).</para>

	<para>The second case is asynchronous meta-data updates.  This
  	  is the default for Linux/ext2fs and
  	  <command>mount -o async</command> for *BSD ufs.  All
  	  meta-data updates are simply being passed through the buffer
  	  cache too, that is, they will be intermixed with the updates
  	  of the file content data.  The advantage of this
  	  implementation is there is no need to wait until each
  	  meta-data update has been written to disk, so all operations
  	  which cause huge amounts of meta-data updates work much
  	  faster than in the synchronous case.  Also, the
  	  implementation is still clear and simple, so there is a low
  	  risk for bugs creeping into the code.  The disadvantage is
  	  that there is no guarantee at all for a consistent state of
  	  the filesystem.  If there is a failure during an operation
  	  that updated large amounts of meta-data (like a power
  	  failure, or someone pressing the reset button),
	  the filesystem
  	  will be left in an unpredictable state.  There is no opportunity
  	  to examine the state of the filesystem when the system
  	  comes up again; the data blocks of a file could already have
  	  been written to the disk while the updates of the inode
  	  table or the associated directory were not.  It is actually
  	  impossible to implement a <command>fsck</command> which is
  	  able to clean up the resulting chaos (because the necessary
  	  information is not available on the disk).  If the
	  filesystem has been damaged beyond repair, the only choice
	  is to use &man.newfs.8; on it and restore it from backup.
	  </para>

	<para>The usual solution for this problem was to implement
	  <emphasis>dirty region logging</emphasis>, which is also
	  referred to as <emphasis>journaling</emphasis>, although that
	  term is not used consistently and is occasionally applied
	  to other forms of transaction logging as well.  Meta-data
	  updates are still written synchronously, but only into a
	  small region of the disk.  Later on they will be moved
	  to their proper location.  Because the logging
	  area is a small, contiguous region on the disk, there
	  are no long distances for the disk heads to move, even
	  during heavy operations, so these operations are quicker
	  than synchronous updates.
	  Additionally the complexity of the implementation is fairly
	  limited, so the risk of bugs being present is low.  A disadvantage
	  is that all meta-data are written twice (once into the
	  logging region and once to the proper location) so for
	  normal work, a performance <quote>pessimization</quote>
	  might result.  On the other hand, in case of a crash, all
	  pending meta-data operations can be quickly either rolled-back
	  or completed from the logging area after the system comes
	  up again, resulting in a fast filesystem startup.</para>

	<para>Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley FFS,
	   solved this problem with Soft Updates: all pending
	   meta-data updates are kept in memory and written out to disk
	   in a sorted sequence (<quote>ordered meta-data
	   updates</quote>).  This has the effect that, in case of
	   heavy meta-data operations, later updates to an item
	   <quote>catch</quote> the earlier ones if the earlier ones are still in
	   memory and have not already been written to disk.  So all
	   operations on, say, a directory are generally performed in
	   memory before the update is written to disk (the data
	   blocks are sorted according to their position so
	   that they will not be on the disk ahead of their meta-data).
	   If the system crashes, this causes an implicit <quote>log
	   rewind</quote>: all operations which did not find their way
	   to the disk appear as if they had never happened.  A
	   consistent filesystem state is maintained that appears to
	   be the one of 30 to 60 seconds earlier.  The
	   algorithm used guarantees that all resources in use
	   are marked as such in their appropriate bitmaps: blocks and inodes.
	   After a crash, the only resource allocation error
	   that occurs is that resources are
	   marked as <quote>used</quote> which are actually <quote>free</quote>.
	   &man.fsck.8; recognizes this situation,
	   and frees the resources that are no longer used.  It is safe to
	   ignore the dirty state of the filesystem after a crash by
	   forcibly mounting it with <command>mount -f</command>.  In
	   order to free resources that may be unused, &man.fsck.8;
	   needs to be run at a later time.  This is the idea behind
	   the <emphasis>background fsck</emphasis>: at system startup
	   time, only a <emphasis>snapshot</emphasis> of the
	   filesystem is recorded.  The <command>fsck</command> can be
	   run later on.  All file systems can then be mounted
	   <quote>dirty</quote>, so the system startup proceeds in
	   multiuser mode.  Then, background <command>fsck</command>s
	   will be scheduled for all file systems where this is required, to free
	   resources that may be unused.  (File systems that do not use
	   Soft Updates still need the usual foreground
	   <command>fsck</command> though.)</para>

	 <para>The advantage is that meta-data operations are nearly as
	   fast as asynchronous updates (i.e. faster than with
	   <emphasis>logging</emphasis>, which has to write the
	   meta-data twice).  The disadvantages are the complexity of
	   the code (implying a higher risk for bugs in an area that
	   is highly sensitive regarding loss of user data), and a
	   higher memory consumption.  Additionally there are some
	   idiosyncrasies one has to get used to.
	   After a crash, the state of the filesystem appears to be
	   somewhat <quote>older</quote>.  In situations where
	   the standard synchronous approach would have caused some
	   zero-length files to remain after the
	   <command>fsck</command>, these files do not exist at all
	   with a Soft Updates filesystem because neither the meta-data
	   nor the file contents have ever been written to disk.
	   Disk space is not released until the updates have been
	   written to disk, which may take place some time after
	   running <command>rm</command>.  This may cause problems
	   when installing large amounts of data on a filesystem
	   that does not have enough free space to hold all the files
	   twice.</para>

	  sysctl variable to <literal>1</literal>.  The system will attempt
	  to calculate the bandwidth delay product for each connection and
	  limit the amount of data queued to the network to just the amount
	  required to maintain optimum throughput.</para>

	<para>This feature is useful if you are serving data over modems,
	  Gigabit Ethernet, or even high speed WAN links (or any other link
	  with a high bandwidth delay product), especially if you are also

	  <literal>6144</literal> may be beneficial.  However, note that
	  setting high minimums may effectively disable bandwidth limiting
	  depending on the link.  The limiting feature reduces the amount of
	  data built up in intermediate route and switch packet queues as
	  well as reduces the amount of data built up in the local host's
	  interface queue.  With fewer packets queued up, interactive
	  connections, especially over slow modems, will also be able to
	  operate with lower <emphasis>Round Trip Times</emphasis>.  However,
	  note that this feature only effects data transmission (uploading
	  / server side).  It has no effect on data reception (downloading).
	</para>

	<para>Adjusting <varname>net.inet.tcp.inflight_stab</varname> is

	  stabilize the algorithm and improve responsiveness to changing
	  conditions, but it can also result in higher ping times over slow
	  links (though still much lower than you would get without the
	  inflight algorithm).  In such cases, you may wish to try reducing
	  this parameter to 15, 10, or 5; and may also have to reduce
	  <varname>net.inet.tcp.inflight_min</varname> (for example, to

      simple enough to add.  You have three ways to increase swap
      space: adding a new hard drive, enabling swap over NFS, and
      creating a swap file on an existing partition.</para>

    <title>Power and Resource Management</title>

    <para>It is very important to utilize hardware resources in an
      efficient manner.  Before <acronym>ACPI</acronym> was introduced,
      it was very difficult and inflexible for operating systems to manage
      the power usage and thermal properties of a system.  The hardware was
      controlled by some sort of <acronym>BIOS</acronym> embedded
      interface, such as <emphasis>Plug and Play BIOS (PNPBIOS)</emphasis>, or
      <emphasis>Advanced Power Management (APM)</emphasis> and so on.
      Power and Resource Management is one of the key components of a modern
      operating system.  For example, you may want an operating system to
      monitor system limits (and possibly alert you) in case your system
      temperature increased unexpectedly.</para>

    <para>In this section of the &os; Handbook, we will provide
      comprehensive information about <acronym>ACPI</acronym>.  References
      will be provided for further reading at the end.  Please be aware
      that <acronym>ACPI</acronym> is available on &os;&nbsp;5.X and
      above systems as a default kernel module.  For &os;&nbsp;4.9,
      <acronym>ACPI</acronym> can be enabled by adding the line
      <literal>device acpi</literal> to a kernel configuration and
      rebuilding.</para>

    <sect2 id="acpi-intro">
      <title>What Is ACPI?</title>

      <para>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
	(<acronym>ACPI</acronym>) is a standard written by
	an alliance of vendors to provide a standard interface for
	hardware resources and power management (hence the name).
	It is a key element in <emphasis>Operating System-directed
	configuration and Power Management</emphasis>, i.e.: it provides
	more control and flexibility to the operating system
	(<acronym>OS</acronym>).
	Modern systems <quote>stretched</quote> the limits of the
	current Plug and Play interfaces (such as APM, which is used in
	&os;&nbsp;4.X), prior to the introduction of
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym>.  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> is the direct
	successor to <acronym>APM</acronym>
	(Advanced Power Management).</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="acpi-old-spec">
      <title>Shortcomings of Advanced Power Management (APM)</title>

      <para>The <emphasis>Advanced Power Management (APM)</emphasis>
      facility control's the power usage of a system based on its
      activity.  The APM BIOS is supplied by the (system) vendor and
      it is specific to the hardware platform.  An APM driver in the
      OS mediates access to the <emphasis>APM Software Interface</emphasis>,
      which allows management of power levels.</para>

      <para>There are four major problems in APM.  Firstly, power
      management is done by the (vendor-specific) BIOS, and the OS
      does not have any knowledge of it.  One example of this, is when
      the user sets idle-time values for a hard drive in the APM BIOS,
      that when exceeded, it (BIOS) would spin down the hard drive,
      without the consent of the OS.  Secondly, the APM logic is
      embedded in the BIOS, and it operates outside the scope of the
      OS.  This means users can only fix problems in their APM BIOS by
      flashing a new one into the ROM; which, is a very dangerous
      procedure, and if it fails, it could leave the system in an
      unrecoverable state. Thirdly, APM is a vendor-specific
      technology, which, means that there is a lot or parity
      (duplication of efforts) and bugs found in one vendor's BIOS,
      may not be solved in others.  Last but not the least, the APM
      BIOS did not have enough room to implement a sophisticated power
      policy, or one that can adapt very well to the purpose of the
      machine.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Plug and Play BIOS (PNPBIOS)</emphasis> was
      unreliable in many situations.  PNPBIOS is 16-bit technology,
      so the OS has to use 16-bit emulation in order to
      <quote>interface</quote> with PNPBIOS methods.</para>

      <para>The &os; <acronym>APM</acronym> driver is documented in
      the &man.apm.4; manual page.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="acpi-config">
      <title>Configuring <acronym>ACPI</acronym></title>

      <para>The <filename>acpi.ko</filename> driver is loaded by default
	at start up by the &man.loader.8; and should <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	be compiled into the kernel.  The reasoning behind this is that modules
	are easier to work with, say if switching to another <filename>acpi.ko</filename>
	without doing a kernel rebuild.  This has the advantage of making testing easier.
	Another reason is that starting <acronym>ACPI</acronym> after a system has been
	brought up is not too useful, and in some cases can be fatal.  In doubt, just
	disable <acronym>ACPI</acronym> all together. This driver should not and can not
	be unloaded because the system bus uses it for various hardware interactions.
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> can be disabled with the &man.acpiconf.8; utility.
	In fact most of the interaction with <acronym>ACPI</acronym> can be done via
	&man.acpiconf.8;.  Basically this means, if anything about <acronym>ACPI</acronym>
	is in the &man.dmesg.8; output, then most likely it is already running.</para>

      <note><para><acronym>ACPI</acronym> and <acronym>APM</acronym> cannot coexist and
	should be used separately.  The last one to load will terminate if the driver
	notices the other running.</para></note>

      <para>In the simplest form, <acronym>ACPI</acronym> can be used to put the
	system into a sleep mode with &man.acpiconf.8;, the <option>-s</option>
	flag, and a <literal>1-5</literal> option.  Most users will only need
	<literal>1</literal>.  Option <literal>5</literal> will do a soft-off
	which is the same action as:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>halt -p</userinput></screen>

      <para>The other options are available.  Check out the &man.acpiconf.8;

      <title>Background</title>

      <para><acronym>ACPI</acronym> is present in all modern computers
	that conform to the ia32 (x86), ia64 (Itanium), and amd64 (AMD)
	architectures.  The full standard has many features including
	<acronym>CPU</acronym> performance management, power planes
	control, thermal zones, various battery systems, embedded
	controllers, and bus enumeration.  Most systems implement less
	than the full standard.  For instance, a desktop system usually
	only implements the bus enumeration parts while a laptop might
	have cooling and battery management support as well.  Laptops
	also have suspend and resume, with their own associated
	complexity.</para>

      <para>An <acronym>ACPI</acronym>-compliant system has various
	components.  The <acronym>BIOS</acronym> and chipset vendors
	provide various fixed tables (e.g., <acronym>FADT</acronym>)
	in memory that specify things like the <acronym>APIC</acronym>
	map (used for <acronym>SMP</acronym>), config registers, and
	simple configuration values.  Additionally, a table of bytecode
	(the <firstterm>Differentiated System Description Table</firstterm>
	<acronym>DSDT</acronym>) is provided that specifies a
	tree-like name space of devices and methods.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>ACPI</acronym> driver must parse the fixed

      <title>Common Problems</title>

      <para>For <acronym>ACPI</acronym> to work correctly, all the parts
	have to work correctly.  Here are some common problems, in order
	of frequency of appearance, and some possible workarounds or
	fixes.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Suspend/Resume</title>

	<para><acronym>ACPI</acronym> has three suspend to
	  <acronym>RAM</acronym> (<acronym>STR</acronym>) states,
	  <literal>S1</literal>-<literal>S3</literal>, and one suspend
	  to disk state (<literal>STD</literal>), called
	  <literal>S4</literal>.  <literal>S5</literal> is
	  <quote>soft off</quote> and is the normal state your system
	  is in when plugged in but not powered up.
	  <literal>S4</literal> can actually be implemented two separate
	  ways.  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>BIOS</acronym> is a
	  <acronym>BIOS</acronym>-assisted suspend to disk.
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>OS</acronym> is implemented
	  entirely by the operating system.</para>

	<para>Start by checking <command>sysctl</command>
	  <option>hw.acpi</option> for the suspend-related items.  Here
	  are the results for my Thinkpad:</para>

	<screen>hw.acpi.supported_sleep_state: S3 S4 S5</screen>
	<screen>hw.acpi.s4bios: 0</screen>

	<para>This means that I can use <command>acpiconf -s</command>
	  to test <literal>S3</literal>,
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>OS</acronym>, and
	  <literal>S5</literal>.  If <option>s4bios</option> was one
	  (<literal>1</literal>), I would have
	  <literal>S4</literal><acronym>BIOS</acronym>
	  support instead of <literal>S4</literal>
	  <acronym>OS</acronym>.</para>

	<para>When testing suspend/resume, start with
	  <literal>S1</literal>, if supported.  This state is most
	  likely to work since it doesn't require much driver support.
	  No one has implemented <literal>S2</literal> but if you have
	  it, it's similar to <literal>S1</literal>.  The next thing
	  to try is <literal>S3</literal>.  This is the deepest
	  <acronym>STR</acronym> state and requires a lot of driver
	  support to properly reinitialize your hardware.  If you have
	  problems resuming, feel free to email the &a.acpi.name; list but
	  do not expect the problem to be resolved since there are a lot
	  of drivers/hardware that need more testing and work.</para>

	<para>To help isolate the problem, remove as many drivers from
	  your kernel as possible.  If it works, you can narrow down
	  which driver is the problem by loading drivers until it fails
	  again.  Typically binary drivers like
	  <filename>nvidia.ko</filename>, <application>X11</application>
	  display drivers, and <acronym>USB</acronym> will have the most
	  problems while Ethernet interfaces usually work fine.  If you
	  can load/unload the drivers ok, you can automate this by
	  putting the appropriate commands in
	  <filename>/etc/rc.suspend</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.resume</filename>.  There is a
	  commented-out example for unloading and loading a driver.  Try
	  setting <option>hw.acpi.reset_video</option> to zero (0) if
	  your display is messed up after resume.  Try setting longer or
	  shorter values for <option>hw.acpi.sleep_delay</option> to see
	  if that helps.</para>

	<para>Another thing to try is load a recent Linux distribution
	  with <acronym>ACPI</acronym> support and test their
	  suspend/resume support on the same hardware.  If it works
	  on Linux, it's likely a &os; driver problem and narrowing down
	  which driver causes the problems will help us fix the problem.
	  Note that the <acronym>ACPI</acronym> maintainers do not
	  usually maintain other drivers (e.g sound,
	  <acronym>ATA</acronym>, etc.) so any work done on tracking
	  down a driver problem should probably eventually be posted
	  to the &a.current.name; list and mailed to the driver
	  maintainer.  If you are feeling adventurous, go ahead and
	  start putting some debugging &man.printf.3;s in a problematic
	  driver to track down where in its resume function it
	  hangs.</para>

	<para>Finally, try disabling <acronym>ACPI</acronym> and
	  enabling <acronym>APM</acronym> instead.  If suspend/resume
	  works with <acronym>APM</acronym>, you may be better off
	  sticking with <acronym>APM</acronym>, especially on older
	  hardware (pre-2000).  It took vendors a while to get
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> support correct and older hardware is
	  more likely to have <acronym>BIOS</acronym> problems with
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym>.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>System Hangs (temporary or permanent)</title>

	<para>Most system hangs are a result of lost interrupts or an
	  interrupt storm.  Chipsets have a lot of problems based on how
	  the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> configures interrupts before boot,
	  correctness of the <acronym>APIC</acronym>
	  (<acronym>MADT</acronym>) table, and routing of the
	  <firstterm>System Control Interrupt</firstterm>
	  (<acronym>SCI</acronym>).</para>

	<para>Interrupt storms can be distinguished from lost interrupts
	  by checking the output of <command>vmstat -i</command>
	  and looking at the line that has
	  <literal>acpi0</literal>.  If the counter is increasing at more
	  than a couple per second, you have an interrupt storm.  If the
	  system appears hung, try breaking to <acronym>DDB</acronym>
	  (<keycombo action="simul"><keycap>CTRL</keycap>
	  <keycap>ALT</keycap><keycap>ESC</keycap></keycombo> on
	  console) and type <option>show interrupts</option>.</para>

	<para>Your best hope when dealing with interrupt problems is to
	  try disabling <acronym>APIC</acronym> support with
	  <literal>hint.apic.0.disabled="1"</literal> in
	  <filename>loader.conf</filename>.</para>

	<para>Panics are relatively rare for <acronym>ACPI</acronym> and
	  are the top priority to be fixed.  The first step is to
	  isolate the steps to reproduce the panic (if possible)
	  and get a backtrace.  Follow the advice for enabling
	  <option>options DDB</option> and setting up a serial console
	  (see <xref linkend="serialconsole-ddb">)
	  or setting up a &man.dump.8; partition.  You can get a
	  backtrace in <acronym>DDB</acronym> with
	  <option>tr</option>.  If you have to handwrite the
	  backtrace, be sure to at least get the lowest five (5) and top
	  five (5) lines in the trace.</para>

	<para>Then, try to isolate the problem by booting with
	  <acronym>ACPI</acronym> disabled.  If that works, you can
	  isolate the <acronym>ACPI</acronym> subsystem by using various
	  values of <option>debug.acpi.disable</option>.  See the
	  &man.acpi.4; manual page for some examples.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>System Powers Up After Suspend or Shutdown</title>
	<para>First, try setting
	  <option>hw.acpi.disable_on_poweroff=</option><quote>0</quote>
	  in &man.loader.conf.5;.  This keeps <acronym>ACPI</acronym>
	  from disabling various events during the shutdown process.
	  Some systems need this value set to <quote>1</quote> (the
	  default) for the same reason.  This usually fixes
	  the problem of a system powering up spontaneously after a
	  suspend or poweroff.</para>

	<title>Other Problems</title>

	<para>If you have other problems with <acronym>ACPI</acronym>
	  (working with a docking station, devices not detected, etc.),
	  please email a description to the mailing list as well;
	  however, some of these issues may be related to unfinished
	  parts of the <acronym>ACPI</acronym> subsystem so they might
	  take a while to be implemented.  Please be patient and
	  prepared to test patches we may send you.</para>

      <title><acronym>ASL</acronym>, <command>acpidump</command>, and
        <acronym>IASL</acronym></title>

      <para>The most common problem is the <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
	vendors providing incorrect (or outright buggy!) bytecode.  This
	is usually manifested by kernel console messages like
	this:</para>

      <screen>ACPI-1287: *** Error: Method execution failed [\\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.FIGD._STA] (Node 0xc3f6d160), AE_NOT_FOUND</screen>

      <para>Often, you can resolve these problems by updating your
	<acronym>BIOS</acronym> to the latest revision.  Most console
	messages are harmless but if you have other problems like
	battery status not working, they're a good place to start
	looking for problems in the <acronym>AML</acronym>.  The
	bytecode, known as <acronym>AML</acronym>, is compiled from a
	source language called <acronym>ASL</acronym>.  The
	<acronym>AML</acronym> is found in the table known as the
	<acronym>DSDT</acronym>.  To get a copy of your
	<acronym>ASL</acronym>, use &man.acpidump.8;.  You should use
	both the <option>-t</option> (show contents of the fixed tables)
	and <option>-d</option> (disassemble <acronym>AML</acronym> to
	<acronym>ASL</acronym>) options.  See the
	<link linkend="ACPI-submitdebug">Submitting Debugging
	Information</link> section for an example syntax.</para>

      <para>The simplest first check you can do is to recompile your
	<acronym>ASL</acronym> to check for errors.  Warnings can
	usually be ignored but errors are bugs that will usually prevent
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> from working correctly.  To recompile
	your <acronym>ASL</acronym>, issue the following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>iasl your.asl</userinput></screen>

      <title>Fixing Your <acronym>ASL</acronym></title>

      <para>In the long run, our goal is for almost everyone to have
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> work without any user intervention.  At
	this point, however, we are still developing workarounds for
	common mistakes made by the <acronym>BIOS</acronym> vendors.
	The Microsoft interpreter (<filename>acpi.sys</filename> and
	<filename>acpiec.sys</filename>) does not strictly check for
	adherence to the standard, and thus many <acronym>BIOS</acronym>
	vendors who only test <acronym>ACPI</acronym> under Windows
	never fix their <acronym>ASL</acronym>.  We hope to continue to
	identify and document exactly what non-standard behavior is
	allowed by Microsoft's interpreter and replicate it so &os; can
	work without forcing users to fix the <acronym>ASL</acronym>.
	As a workaround and to help us identify behavior, you can fix
	the <acronym>ASL</acronym> manually.  If this works for you,
	please send a &man.diff.1; of the old and new
	<acronym>ASL</acronym> so we can possibly work around the buggy
	behavior in <acronym>ACPI-CA</acronym> and thus make your fix
	unnecessary.</para>

      <para>Here is a list of common error messages, their cause, and
	how to fix them:</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>_OS dependencies</title>

	<para>Some <acronym>AML</acronym> assumes the world consists of
	  various Windows versions.  You can tell &os; to claim it is
	  any <acronym>OS</acronym> to see if this fixes problems you
	  may have.  An easy way to override this is to set
	  <option>hw.acpi.osname</option>=<quote>Windows 2001</quote>
	  in <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> or other similar
	  strings you find in the <acronym>ASL</acronym>.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Missing Return statements</title>

	<para>Some methods do not explicitly return a value as the
	  standard requires.  While <acronym>ACPI-CA</acronym>
	  does not handle this, &os; has a workaround that allows it to
	  return the value implicitly.  You can also add explicit
	  Return statements where required if you know what value should
	  be returned.  To force <command>iasl</command> to compile the
	  <acronym>ASL</acronym>, use the <option>-f</option>
	  flag.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Overriding the Default <acronym>AML</acronym></title>

	<para>After you customize <filename>your.asl</filename>, you
	  will want to compile it, run:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>iasl your.asl</userinput></screen>

	<para>You can add the <option>-f</option> flag to force creation
	  of the <acronym>AML</acronym>, even if there are errors during
	  compilation.  Remember that some errors (e.g., missing Return
	  statements) are automatically worked around by the
	  interpreter.</para>

	<para><filename>DSDT.aml</filename> is the default output
	  filename for <command>iasl</command>.  You can load this
	  instead of your <acronym>BIOS</acronym>'s buggy copy (which
	  is still present in flash memory) by editing
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> as
	  follows:</para>

	<programlisting>acpi_dsdt_load="YES"
acpi_dsdt_name="/boot/DSDT.aml"</programlisting>

	<para>Be sure to copy your <filename>DSDT.aml</filename> to the
	  <filename role="directory">/boot</filename> directory.</para>

      <title>Getting Debugging Output From
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym></title>

      <para>The <acronym>ACPI</acronym> driver has a very flexible
	debugging facility.  It allows you to specify a set of subsystems
	as well as the level of verbosity.  The subsystems you wish to
	debug are specified as <quote>layers</quote> and are broken down
	into <acronym>ACPI-CA</acronym> components (ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS)
	and <acronym>ACPI</acronym> hardware support (ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS).
	The verbosity of debugging output is specified as the
	<quote>level</quote> and ranges from ACPI_LV_ERROR (just report
	errors) to ACPI_LV_VERBOSE (everything).  The
	<quote>level</quote> is a bitmask so multiple options can be set
	at once, separated by spaces.  In practice, you will want to use
	a serial console to log the output if it is so long
	it flushes the console message buffer.  A full list of the
	individual layers and levels is found in the &man.acpi.4; manual
	page.</para>

      <para>Debugging output is not enabled by default.  To enable it,
	add <option>options ACPI_DEBUG</option> to your kernel config
	if <acronym>ACPI</acronym> is compiled into the kernel.  You can
	add <option>ACPI_DEBUG=1</option> to your
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> to enable it globally.  If
	it is a module, you can recompile just your
	<filename>acpi.ko</filename> module as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /sys/modules/acpi/acpi
&amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp;
make ACPI_DEBUG=1</userinput></screen>

      <para>Install <filename>acpi.ko</filename> in
	<filename role="directory">/boot/kernel</filename> and add your
	desired level and layer to <filename>loader.conf</filename>.
	This example enables debug messages for all
	<acronym>ACPI-CA</acronym> components and all
	<acronym>ACPI</acronym> hardware drivers
	(<acronym>CPU</acronym>, <acronym>LID</acronym>, etc.)  It will
	only output error messages, the least verbose level.</para>

      <programlisting>debug.acpi.layer="ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS"
debug.acpi.level="ACPI_LV_ERROR"</programlisting>

      <para>If the information you want is triggered by a specific event
	(say, a suspend and then resume), you can leave out changes to
	<filename>loader.conf</filename> and instead use
	<command>sysctl</command> to specify the layer and level after
	booting and preparing your system for the specific event.  The
	<command>sysctl</command>s are named the same as the tunables
	in <filename>loader.conf</filename>.</para>
