    <title>Adding Disks</title>

    <para>Lets say we want to add a new SCSI disk to a machine that
      currently only has a single drive.  First turn off the computer
      and install the drive in the computer following the instructions
      of the computer, controller, and drive manufacturer.  Due to the
      wide variations of procedures to do this, the details are beyond
      the scope of this document.</para>

    <para>Login as user <username>root</username>.  After you have installed the
      drive, inspect <filename>/var/run/dmesg.boot</filename> to ensure the new
      disk was found.  Continuing with our example, the newly added drive will
      be <devicename>da1</devicename> and we want to mount it on
      <filename>/1</filename> (if you are adding an IDE drive, the device name
      will be <devicename>wd1</devicename> in pre-4.0 systems, or
      <devicename>ad1</devicename> in most 4.X systems).</para>

    <indexterm><primary>partitions</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>slices</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary><command>fdisk</command></primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Because FreeBSD runs on IBM-PC compatible computers, it must
      take into account the PC BIOS partitions.  These are different
      from the traditional BSD partitions.  A PC disk has up to four
      BIOS partition entries.  If the disk is going to be truly
      dedicated to FreeBSD, you can use the
      <emphasis>dedicated</emphasis> mode.  Otherwise, FreeBSD will
      have to live within one of the PC BIOS partitions.  FreeBSD
      calls the PC BIOS partitions <emphasis>slices</emphasis> so as
      not to confuse them with traditional BSD partitions.  You may
      also use slices on a disk that is dedicated to FreeBSD, but used
      in a computer that also has another operating system installed.
      This is to not confuse the <command>fdisk</command> utility of
      the other operating system.</para>

    <para>In the slice case the drive will be added as
      <filename>/dev/da1s1e</filename>.  This is read as: SCSI disk,
      unit number 1 (second SCSI disk), slice 1 (PC BIOS partition 1),
      and <filename>e</filename> BSD partition.  In the dedicated
      case, the drive will be added simply as
      <filename>/dev/da1e</filename>.</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Navigating <application>Sysinstall</application></title>

	  <para>You may use <command>/stand/sysinstall</command> to
	    partition and label a new disk using its easy to use menus.
	    Either login as user <username>root</username> or use the
	    <command>su</command> command.  Run
	    <command>/stand/sysinstall</command> and enter the
	    <literal>Configure</literal> menu.  Within the
	    <literal>FreeBSD Configuration Menu</literal>, scroll down and
	    select the <literal>Fdisk</literal> option.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title><application>fdisk</application> Partition Editor</title>
	  <para>Once inside <application>fdisk</application>, we can type <userinput>A</userinput> to
	    use the entire disk for FreeBSD.  When asked if you want to
	    <quote>remain cooperative with any future possible operating
	      systems</quote>, answer <literal>YES</literal>.  Write the
	    changes to the disk using <userinput>W</userinput>.  Now exit the
	    FDISK editor by typing <userinput>q</userinput>.  Next you will be
	    asked about the Master Boot Record.  Since you are adding a
	    disk to an already running system, choose
	    <literal>None</literal>.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Disk Label Editor</title>
	  <indexterm><primary>BSD partitions</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>Next, you need to exit <application>sysinstall</application>
            and start it again.  Follow the directions above, although this
            time choose the <literal>Label</literal> option. This will
	    enter the <literal>Disk Label Editor</literal>.  This
	    is where you will create the traditional BSD partitions.  A
	    disk can have up to eight partitions, labeled
	    <literal>a-h</literal>.
	    A few of the partition labels have special uses.  The
	    <literal>a</literal> partition is used for the root partition
	    (<filename>/</filename>).  Thus only your system disk (e.g,
	    the disk you boot from) should have an <literal>a</literal>
	    partition.  The <literal>b</literal> partition is used for
	    swap partitions, and you may have many disks with swap
	    partitions.  The <literal>c</literal> partition addresses the
	    entire disk in dedicated mode, or the entire FreeBSD slice in
	    slice mode.  The other partitions are for general use.</para>

	  <para><application>sysinstall</application>'s Label editor
	    favors the <literal>e</literal>
	    partition for non-root, non-swap partitions.  Within the
	    Label editor, create a single file system by typing
	    <userinput>C</userinput>.  When prompted if this will be a FS
	    (file system) or swap, choose <literal>FS</literal> and type in a
	    mount point (e.g, <filename>/mnt</filename>).  When adding a
	    disk in post-install mode, <application>sysinstall</application>
	    will not create entries
	    in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> for you, so the mount point
	    you specify is not important.</para>

	  <para>You are now ready to write the new label to the disk and
	    create a file system on it.  Do this by typing
	    <userinput>W</userinput>.  Ignore any errors from
	    <application>sysinstall</application> that
	    it could not mount the new partition.  Exit the Label Editor
	    and <application>sysinstall</application> completely.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Finish</title>

	  <para>The last step is to edit <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
	    to add an entry for your new disk.</para>

	<title>Concatenated Disk Driver (CCD) Configuration</title>
	<para>When choosing a mass storage solution the most important
	  factors to consider are speed, reliability, and cost.  It is 
	  rare to have all three in balance; normally a fast, reliable mass
	  storage device is expensive, and to cut back on cost either speed
	  or reliability must be sacrificed.</para>

          <para>In designing the system described below, cost was chosen
          as  the most important factor, followed by speed, then reliability.
          Data transfer speed for this system is ultimately
          constrained by the network.  And while reliability is very important,
          the CCD drive described below serves online data that is already
          fully backed up on CD-R's and can easily be replaced.</para>  

          <para>Defining your own requirements is the first step
          in choosing a mass storage solution.  If your requirements prefer
          speed or reliability over cost, your solution will differ from
          the system described in this section.</para>


	<sect4 id="ccd-installhw">
	  <title>Installing the Hardware</title>

	  <para>In addition to the IDE system disk, three Western 
            Digital 30GB, 5400 RPM IDE disks form the core
            of the CCD disk described below providing approximately
	    90GB of online storage.  Ideally,
	    each IDE disk would have its own IDE controller
	    and cable, but to minimize cost, additional 
	    IDE controllers were not used.  Instead the disks were
	    configured with jumpers so that each IDE controller has
            one master, and one slave.</para>

	  <para>Upon reboot, the system BIOS was configured to
	    automatically detect the disks attached.  More importantly,
	    FreeBSD detected them on reboot:</para>

	  <programlisting>ad0: 19574MB &lt;WDC WD205BA&gt; [39770/16/63] at ata0-master UDMA33
ad1: 29333MB &lt;WDC WD307AA&gt; [59598/16/63] at ata0-slave UDMA33
ad2: 29333MB &lt;WDC WD307AA&gt; [59598/16/63] at ata1-master UDMA33
ad3: 29333MB &lt;WDC WD307AA&gt; [59598/16/63] at ata1-slave UDMA33</programlisting>

 	  <note><para>If FreeBSD does not detect all the disks, ensure
 	    that you have jumpered them correctly.  Most IDE drives
 	    also have a <quote>Cable Select</quote> jumper.  This is
 	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> the jumper for the master/slave
 	    relationship.  Consult the drive documentation for help in
 	    identifying the correct jumper.</para></note>
 
 	  <para>Next, consider how to attach them as part of the file
 	    system.  You should research both &man.vinum.8; (<xref
 	    linkend="vinum-vinum">) and &man.ccd.4;.  In this
 	    particular configuration, &man.ccd.4; was chosen.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="ccd-setup">
	  <title>Setting Up the CCD</title>

 	  <para>The driver &man.ccd.4; allows you to take
  	    several identical disks and concatenate them into one
  	    logical file system.  In order to use
 	    &man.ccd.4;, you need a kernel with
 	    &man.ccd.4; support built in.
 	    Add this line to your kernel configuration file, rebuild, and 
 	    reinstall the kernel:</para>

	  <programlisting>pseudo-device   ccd     4</programlisting>

	  <para>On 5.X systems, you have to use instead the following
	    line:</para>

	  <programlisting>device   ccd</programlisting>

	  <note><para>In FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X, it is not necessary to specify
	    a number of &man.ccd.4; devices, as the &man.ccd.4; device driver is now
	    self-cloning &mdash; new device instances will automatically be
	    created on demand.</para></note>

	  <para>The &man.ccd.4; support can also be
	    loaded as a kernel loadable module in FreeBSD 3.0 or
	    later.</para>

 	  <para>To set up &man.ccd.4;, you must first use
 	    &man.disklabel.8; to label the disks:</para>

	  <programlisting>disklabel -r -w ad1 auto
disklabel -r -w ad2 auto
disklabel -r -w ad3 auto</programlisting>

 	  <para>This creates a disklabel for <devicename>ad1c</devicename>, <devicename>ad2c</devicename> and <devicename>ad3c</devicename> that
  	    spans the entire disk.</para>

	  <note><para>Since &os;&nbsp;5.1-RELEASE, the &man.bsdlabel.8;
	    utility replaces the old &man.disklabel.8; program.  With
	    &man.bsdlabel.8; a number of obsolete options and parameters
	    have been retired; in the examples above the option
	    <option>-r</option> should be removed.  For more
	    information, please refer to the &man.bsdlabel.8;
	    manual page.</para></note>

 	  <para>The next step is to change the disk label type.  You
 	    can use &man.disklabel.8; to edit the
 	    disks:</para>

	  <programlisting>disklabel -e ad1
disklabel -e ad2
disklabel -e ad3</programlisting>

 	  <para>This opens up the current disk label on each disk with
 	    the editor specified by the <envar>EDITOR</envar>
 	    environment variable, typically &man.vi.1;.</para>

	  <para>An unmodified disk label will look something like
	    this:</para>

	  <programlisting>8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  c: 60074784        0    unused        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)</programlisting>

 	  <para>Add a new <literal>e</literal> partition for &man.ccd.4; to use. This
 	    can usually be copied from the <literal>c</literal> partition,
 	    but the <option>fstype</option> <emphasis>must</emphasis>
 	    be <userinput>4.2BSD</userinput>.  The disk label should
 	    now look something like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  c: 60074784        0    unused        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)
  e: 60074784        0    4.2BSD        0     0     0   # (Cyl.    0 - 59597)</programlisting>

	<sect4 id="ccd-buildingfs">

            <para>The device node for

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>CDs have a number of features that differentiate them from
	conventional disks. Initially, they were not writable by the
	user. They are designed so that they can be read continuously without
	delays to move the head between tracks. They are also much easier
	to transport between systems than similarly sized media were at the
	time.</para>

      <para>CDs do have tracks, but this refers to a section of data to
	be read continuously and not a physical property of the disk. To
	produce a CD on FreeBSD, you prepare the data files that are going
	to make up the tracks on the CD, then write the tracks to the
	CD.</para>

      </indexterm>
      <para>The ISO 9660 file system was designed to deal with these
	differences. It unfortunately codifies file system limits that were
	common then. Fortunately, it provides an extension mechanism that
	allows properly written CDs to exceed those limits while still
	working with systems that do not support those extensions.</para>

      <para>The <filename role="package">sysutils/mkisofs</filename>

      <para>Which tool to use to burn the CD depends on whether your CD burner
	is ATAPI or something else. ATAPI CD burners use the <command><link

	the base system. SCSI and USB CD burners should use
	<command><link linkend="cdrecord">cdrecord</link></command> from
	the <filename role="package">sysutils/cdrtools</filename> port.</para>

      <para><command>burncd</command> has a limited number of
	supported drives. To find out if a drive is supported, see the
	<ulink url="http://www.freebsd.dk/ata/">CD-R/RW supported

    <sect2 id="mkisofs">
      <title>mkisofs</title>

      <para><filename role="package">sysutils/mkisofs</filename> produces an ISO 9660 file system
	that is an image of a directory tree in the &unix; file system name
	space. The simplest usage is:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkisofs -o <replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable> <replaceable>/path/to/tree</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>file systems</primary>
        <secondary>ISO 9660</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>This command will create an <replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable>
	containing an ISO 9660 file system that is a copy of the tree at
	<replaceable>/path/to/tree</replaceable>. In the process, it will
	map the file names to names that fit the limitations of the
	standard ISO 9660 file system, and will exclude files that have
	names uncharacteristic of ISO file systems.</para>

      </indexterm>
      <para>A number of options are available to overcome those
	restrictions. In particular, <option>-R</option> enables the
	Rock Ridge extensions common to &unix; systems, <option>-J</option>
	enables Joliet extensions used by Microsoft systems, and
	<option>-hfs</option> can be used to create HFS file systems used
	by &macos;.</para>

      <para>For CDs that are going to be used only on FreeBSD systems,
	<option>-U</option> can be used to disable all filename
	restrictions. When used with <option>-R</option>, it produces a
	file system image that is identical to the FreeBSD tree you started
	from, though it may violate the ISO 9660 standard in a number of
	ways.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>CDROMs</primary>
        <secondary>creating bootable</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The last option of general use is <option>-b</option>. This is
	used to specify the location of the boot image for use in producing an
	<quote>El Torito</quote> bootable CD. This option takes an
	argument which is the path to a boot image from the top of the
	tree being written to the CD. So, given that
	<filename>/tmp/myboot</filename> holds a bootable FreeBSD system
	with the boot image in
	<filename>/tmp/myboot/boot/cdboot</filename>, you could produce the
	image of an ISO 9660 file system in
	<filename>/tmp/bootable.iso</filename> like so:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkisofs -U -R -b boot/cdboot -o /tmp/bootable.iso /tmp/myboot</userinput></screen>

      <para>Having done that, if you have <devicename>vn</devicename>
	(FreeBSD&nbsp;4.X), or <devicename>md</devicename>
	(FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X)
	configured in your kernel, you can mount the file system with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>vnconfig -e vn0c /tmp/bootable.iso</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/vn0c /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>for FreeBSD&nbsp;4.X, and for FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /tmp/bootable.iso -u 0</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/md0 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>At which point you can verify that <filename>/mnt</filename>
	and <filename>/tmp/myboot</filename> are identical.</para>

      <para>There are many other options you can use with
	<filename role="package">sysutils/mkisofs</filename> to fine-tune its behavior.  In particular:
	modifications to an ISO 9660 layout and the creation of Joliet
	and HFS discs.  See the	&man.mkisofs.8; manual page for details.</para>

      </indexterm>
      <para>If you have an ATAPI CD burner, you can use the
	<command>burncd</command> command to burn an ISO image onto a
	CD. <command>burncd</command> is part of the base system, installed
	as <filename>/usr/sbin/burncd</filename>.  Usage is very simple, as
	it has few options:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>burncd -f <replaceable>cddevice</replaceable> data <replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable> fixate</userinput></screen>

      <para>Will burn a copy of <replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable> on
	<replaceable>cddevice</replaceable>. The default device is
	<filename>/dev/acd0</filename> (or <filename>/dev/acd0c</filename> under &os;&nbsp;4.X). See &man.burncd.8; for options to
	set the write speed, eject the CD after burning, and write audio
	data.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="cdrecord">
      <title>cdrecord</title>

      <para>If you do not have an ATAPI CD burner, you will have to use
	<command>cdrecord</command> to burn your
	CDs. <command>cdrecord</command> is not part of the base system;
	you must install it from either the port at <filename role="package">sysutils/cdrtools</filename>
	or the appropriate
	package. Changes to the base system can cause binary versions of
	this program to fail, possibly resulting in a
	<quote>coaster</quote>. You should therefore either upgrade the
	port when you upgrade your system, or if you are <link
	linkend="stable">tracking -STABLE</link>, upgrade the port when a
	new version becomes available.</para>

      <para>While <command>cdrecord</command> has many options, basic usage
	is even simpler than <command>burncd</command>. Burning an ISO 9660
	image is done with:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cdrecord dev=<replaceable>device</replaceable> <replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The tricky part of using <command>cdrecord</command> is finding
	the <option>dev</option> to use. To find the proper setting, use
	the <option>-scanbus</option> flag of <command>cdrecord</command>,
	which might produce results like this:</para>
      <indexterm>

      <title>Duplicating Data CDs</title>

      <para>You can copy a data CD to a image file that is
	functionally equivalent to the image file created with
	<filename role="package">sysutils/mkisofs</filename>, and you can use it to duplicate
	any data CD.  The example given here assumes that your CDROM
	device is <devicename>acd0</devicename>.  Substitute your
	correct CDROM device.  Under &os;&nbsp;4.X, a <literal>c</literal> must be appended
	to the end of the device name to indicate the entire partition
	or, in the case of CDROMs, the entire disc.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dd if=/dev/acd0 of=file.iso bs=2048</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now that you have an image, you can burn it to CD as
	described above.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="mounting-cd">
      <title>Using Data CDs</title>

      <para>Now that you have created a standard data CDROM, you
	probably want to mount it and read the data on it.  By
	default, &man.mount.8; assumes that a file system is of type
	<literal>ufs</literal>.  If you try something like:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/cd0 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>you will get a complaint about <errorname>Incorrect super
	  block</errorname>, and no mount. The CDROM is not a
	  <literal>UFS</literal> file system, so attempts to mount it
	  as such will fail.  You just need to tell &man.mount.8; that
	  the file system is of type <literal>ISO9660</literal>, and
	  everything will work.  You do this by specifying the
	  <option>-t cd9660</option> option &man.mount.8;. For
	  example, if you want to mount the CDROM device,
	  <devicename>/dev/cd0</devicename>, under
	  <filename>/mnt</filename>, you would execute:</para>

          <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>Note that your device name
	(<devicename>/dev/cd0</devicename> in this example) could be
	different, depending on the interface your CDROM uses. Also,
	the <option>-t cd9660</option> option just executes
	&man.mount.cd9660.8;. The above example could be shortened
	to:</para>

<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount_cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>You can generally use data CDROMs from any vendor in this
	way.  Disks with certain ISO 9660 extensions might behave
	oddly, however.  For example, Joliet disks store all filenames
	in two-byte Unicode characters.  The FreeBSD kernel does not
	speak Unicode (yet!), so non-English characters show up as
	question marks.  (If you are running FreeBSD 4.3 or later, the
	CD9660 driver includes hooks to load an appropriate Unicode
	conversion table on the fly.  Modules for some of the common
	encodings are available via the
	<filename role="package">sysutils/cd9660_unicode</filename> port.)</para>

      <para>Occasionally, you might get <errorname>Device not
	configured</errorname> when trying to mount a CDROM.  This
	usually means that the CDROM drive thinks that there is no
	disk in the tray, or that the drive is not visible on the bus.
	It can take a couple of seconds for a CDROM drive to realize
	that it has been fed, so be patient.</para>

      <para>Sometimes, a SCSI CDROM may be missed because it did not
	have enough time to answer the bus reset.  If you have a SCSI
	CDROM please add the following option to your kernel
	configuration and <link linkend="kernelconfig-building">rebuild your kernel</link>.</para>

      <programlisting>options SCSI_DELAY=15000</programlisting>

      <para>This tells your SCSI bus to pause 15 seconds during boot,
	to give your CDROM drive every possible chance to answer the
	bus reset.</para>

    <sect2 id="rawdata-cd">
      <title>Burning Raw Data CDs</title>

      <para>You can choose to burn a file directly to CD, without
	creating an ISO 9660 file system.  Some people do this for
	backup purposes.  This runs more quickly than burning a
	standard CD:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>burncd -f /dev/acd1 -s 12 data archive.tar.gz fixate</userinput></screen>

      <para>In order to retrieve the data burned to such a CD, you

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>tar xzvf /dev/acd1</userinput></screen>

      <para>You cannot mount this disk as you would a normal CDROM.
	  Such a CDROM cannot be read under any operating system
	  except FreeBSD.  If you want to be able to mount the CD, or
	  share data with another operating system, you must use
	  <filename role="package">sysutils/mkisofs</filename> as described above.</para>

      <title>Using the ATAPI/CAM Driver</title>

      <para>This driver allows ATAPI devices (CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD

	so allows the use of applications like <filename
	role="package">sysutils/cdrdao</filename> or
	&man.cdrecord.1;.</para>

      <para>To use this driver, you will need to add the following
	lines to your kernel configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>device atapicam
device scbus
device cd
device pass</programlisting>

      <para>You also need the following line in your kernel
	configuration file:</para>

      <programlisting>device ata</programlisting>

      <para>which should already be present.</para>

      <para>Then rebuild, install your new kernel, and reboot your

	like so:</para>

      <screen>acd0: CD-RW &lt;MATSHITA CD-RW/DVD-ROM UJDA740&gt; at ata1-master PIO4
cd0 at ata1 bus 0 target 0 lun 0

cd0: 16.000MB/s transfers
cd0: Attempt to query device size failed: NOT READY, Medium not present - tray closed</screen>

      <para>The drive could now be accessed via the
	<filename>/dev/cd0</filename> device name, for example to
	mount a CD-ROM on <filename>/mnt</filename>, just type the
	following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -t cd9660 <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> /mnt</userinput></screen>

      <para>As <username>root</username>, you can run the following
	command to get the SCSI address of the burner:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>camcontrol devlist</userinput>
&lt;MATSHITA CDRW/DVD UJDA740 1.00&gt;   at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (pass0,cd0)</screen>

      <para>So <literal>1,0,0</literal> will be the SCSI address to
	use with &man.cdrecord.1; and other SCSI application.</para>

    </indexterm>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Compared to the CD, the DVD is the next generation of
	optical media storage technology.  The DVD can hold more data
	than any CD and is nowadays the standard for video
	publishing.</para>

      <para>Five physical recordable formats can be defined for what
	we will call a recordable DVD:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>DVD-R: This was the first DVD recordable format
	    available.  The DVD-R standard is defined by the <ulink
	    url="http://www.dvdforum.com/forum.shtml">DVD Forum</ulink>.
	    This format is write once.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>DVD-RW: This is the rewriteable version of
	    the DVD-R standard.  A DVD-RW can be rewritten about 1000
	    times.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>DVD-RAM: This is also a rewriteable format
	    supported by the DVD Forum.  A DVD-RAM can be seen as a
	    removable hard drive.  However, this media is not
	    compatible with most DVD-ROM drives and DVD-Video players;
	    only a few DVD writers support the DVD-RAM format.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>DVD+RW: This is a rewriteable format defined by
	    the <ulink url="http://www.dvdrw.com/">DVD+RW
	    Alliance</ulink>.  A DVD+RW can be rewritten about 1000
	    times.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>DVD+R: This format is the write once variation
	    of the DVD+RW format.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>A single layer recordable DVD can hold up to
	4,700,000,000&nbsp;bytes which is actually 4.38&nbsp;GB or
	4485&nbsp;MB (1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes).</para>

      <note>
	<para>A distinction must be made between the physical media and
	  the application.   For example, a DVD-Video is a specific
	  file layout that can be written on any recordable DVD
	  physical media: DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW etc.  Before choosing
	  the type of media, you must be sure that both the burner and the
	  DVD-Video player (a standalone player or a DVD-ROM drive on
	  a computer) are compatible with the media under consideration.</para></note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>

      <para>The program &man.growisofs.1; will be used to perform DVD
	recording.  This command is part of the
	<application>dvd+rw-tools</application> utilities (<filename
	role="package">sysutils/dvd+rw-tools</filename>).  The
	<application>dvd+rw-tools</application> support all DVD media
	types.</para>

      <para>These tools use the SCSI subsystem to access to the
	devices, therefore the <link linkend="atapicam">ATAPI/CAM
	support</link> must be added to your kernel.</para>

      <para>You also have to enable DMA access for ATAPI devices, this
	can be done in adding the following line to the
	<filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>hw.ata.atapi_dma="1"</programlisting>

      <para>Before attempting to use the
	<application>dvd+rw-tools</application> you should consult the
	<ulink
	url="http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/hcn.html">dvd+rw-tools'
	hardware compatibility notes</ulink> for any information
	related to your DVD burner.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Burning Data DVDs</title>

      <para>The &man.growisofs.1; command is a frontend to <link
	linkend="mkisofs">mkisofs</link>, it will invoke
	&man.mkisofs.8; to create the file system layout and will
	perform the write on the DVD.  This means you do not need to
	create an image of the data before the burning process.</para>
	
      <para>To burn onto a DVD+R or a DVD-R the data from the <filename
	role="directory">/path/to/data</filename> directory, use the
	following command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -dvd-compat -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -J -R <replaceable>/path/to/data</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The options <option>-J -R</option> are passed to
	&man.mkisofs.8; for the file system creation (in this case: an
	ISO 9660 file system with Joliet and Rock Ridge extensions),
	consult the &man.mkisofs.8; manual page for more
	details.</para>

      <para>The option <option>-Z</option> is used for the initial
	session recording in any case: multiple sessions or not.  The
	DVD device, <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable>, must be
	changed according to your configuration.  The
	<option>-dvd-compat</option> parameter will close the disk,
	the recording will be unappendable.  In return this should provide better
	media compatibility with DVD-ROM drives.</para>

      <para>It is also possible to burn a pre-mastered image, for
	example to burn the image
	<replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable>, we will run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -dvd-compat -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable>=<replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The write speed should be detected and automatically set
	according to the media and the drive being used.  If you want
	to force the write speed, use the <option>-speed=</option>
	parameter.  For more information, read the &man.growisofs.1;
	manual page.</para>

      <title>Burning a DVD-Video</title>

      <para>A DVD-Video is a specific file layout based on ISO 9660
	and the micro-UDF (M-UDF) specifications.  The DVD-Video also
	presents a specific data structure hierarchy, it is the reason
	why you need a particular program such as <filename
	role="package">multimedia/dvdauthor</filename> to author the
	DVD.</para>

      <para>If you already have an image of the DVD-Video file system,
	just burn it in the same way as for any image, see the
	previous section for an example.  If you have made the DVD
	authoring and the result is in, for example, the directory
	<filename role="directory">/path/to/video</filename>, the
	following command should be used to burn the DVD-Video:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -dvd-video <replaceable>/path/to/video</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The <option>-dvd-video</option> option will be passed down to
	&man.mkisofs.8; and will instruct it to create a DVD-Video file system
	layout.  Beside this, the <option>-dvd-video</option> option
	implies <option>-dvd-compat</option> &man.growisofs.1;
	option.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using a DVD+RW</title>

      <para>Unlike CD-RW, a virgin DVD+RW needs to be formatted before
	first use.  The &man.growisofs.1; program will take care of it
	automatically whenever appropriate, which is the
	<emphasis>recommended</emphasis> way.  However you can use the
	<command>dvd+rw-format</command> command to format the
	DVD+RW:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dvd+rw-format <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>You need to perform this operation just once, keep in mind
	that only virgin DVD+RW medias need to be formatted.  Then you
	can burn the DVD+RW in the way seen in previous
	sections.</para>

      <para>If you want to burn new data (burn a totally new file
	system not append some data) onto a DVD+RW, you do not need to
	blank it, you just have to write over the previous recording
	(in performing a new initial session), like this:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -J -R <replaceable>/path/to/newdata</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>DVD+RW format offers the possibility to easily append data
	to a previous recording.  The operation consists in merging a
	new session to the existing one, it is not multisession
	writing, &man.growisofs.1; will <emphasis>grow</emphasis> the
	ISO 9660 file system present on the media.</para>

      <para>For example, if we want to append data to our previous
	DVD+RW, we have to use the following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -M <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -J -R <replaceable>/path/to/nextdata</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>The same &man.mkisofs.8; options we used to burn the
	initial session should be used during next writes.</para>

      <note>
	<para>You may want to use the <option>-dvd-compat</option>
	  option if you want better media compatibility with DVD-ROM
	  drives.  In the DVD+RW case, this will not prevent you from
	  adding data.</para>
      </note>

      <para>If for any reason you really want to blank the media, do
	the following:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable>=<replaceable>/dev/zero</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <title>Using a DVD-RW</title>

      <para>A DVD-RW accepts two disc formats: the incremental
	sequential one and the restricted overwrite.  By default
	DVD-RW discs are in sequential format.</para>

      <para>A virgin DVD-RW can be directly written without the need
	of a formatting operation, however a non-virgin DVD-RW in
	sequential format needs to be blanked before to be able to
	write a new initial session.</para>

      <para>To blank a DVD-RW in sequential mode, run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dvd+rw-format -blank=full <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <note>
	<para>A full blanking (<option>-blank=full</option>) will take
	  about one hour on a 1x media.  A fast blanking can be
	  performed using the <option>-blank</option> option if the
	  DVD-RW will be recorded in Disk-At-Once (DAO) mode.  To burn
	  the DVD-RW in DAO mode, use the command:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -use-the-force-luke=dao -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable>=<replaceable>imagefile.iso</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	<para>The <option>-use-the-force-luke=dao</option> option
	  should not be required since &man.growisofs.1; attempts to
	  detect minimally (fast blanked) media and engage DAO
	  write.</para>

	<para>In fact one should use restricted overwrite mode with
	  any DVD-RW, this format is more flexible than the default
	  incremental sequential one.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To write data on a sequential DVD-RW, use the same
	instructions as for the other DVD formats:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -Z <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -J -R <replaceable>/path/to/data</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>If you want to append some data to your previous
	recording, you will have to use the &man.growisofs.1;
	<option>-M</option> option.  However, if you perform data
	addition on a DVD-RW in incremental sequential mode, a new
	session will be created on the disc and the result will be a
	multi-session disc.</para>

      <para>A DVD-RW in restricted overwrite format does not need to
	be blanked before a new initial session, you just have to
	overwrite the disc with the <option>-Z</option> option, this
	is similar to the DVD+RW case.  It is also possible to grow an
	existing ISO 9660 file system written on the disc in a same
	way as for a DVD+RW with the <option>-M</option> option.  The
	result will be a one-session DVD.</para>

      <para>To put a DVD-RW in the restricted overwrite format, the
	following command must be used:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dvd+rw-format <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>To change back to the sequential format use:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>dvd+rw-format -blank=full <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Multisession</title>

      <para>Very few DVD-ROM and DVD-Video players support
	multisession DVDs, they will most of time, hopefully, only read
	the first session.  DVD+R, DVD-R and DVD-RW in sequential
	format can accept multiple sessions, the notion of multiple
	sessions does not exist for the DVD+RW and the DVD-RW
	restricted overwrite formats.</para>

      <para>Using the following command after an initial (non-closed)
	session on a DVD+R, DVD-R, or DVD-RW in sequential format,
	will add a new session to the disc:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>growisofs -M <replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable> -J -R <replaceable>/path/to/nextdata</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>Using this command line with a DVD+RW or a DVD-RW in restricted
	overwrite mode, will append data in merging the new session to
	the existing one.  The result will be a single-session disc.
	This is the way used to add data after an initial write on these
	medias.</para>

      <note>
	<para>Some space on the media is used between each session for
	  end and start of sessions.  Therefore, one should add
	  sessions with large amount of data to optimize media space.
	  The number of sessions is limited to 154 for a DVD+R and
	  about 2000 for a DVD-R.</para>

      <para>To obtain more information about a DVD, the
	<command>dvd+rw-mediainfo
	<replaceable>/dev/cd0</replaceable></command> command can be

    <title>Creating and Using Floppy Disks</title>

    <para>Storing data on floppy disks is sometimes useful, for
      example when one does not have any other removable storage media
      or when one needs to transfer small amounts of data to another
      computer.</para>

    <para>This section will explain how to use floppy disks in
      FreeBSD.  It will primarily cover formatting and usage of
      3.5inch DOS floppies, but the concepts are similar for other
      floppy disk formats.</para>

	<title>The Device</title>

	<para>Floppy disks are accessed through entries in
	  <filename>/dev</filename>, just like other devices.  To
	  access the raw floppy disk in 4.X and earlier releases, one
	  uses
	  <filename>/dev/fd<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>,
	  where <replaceable>N</replaceable> stands for the drive
	  number, usually 0, or
	  <filename>/dev/fd<replaceable>NX</replaceable></filename>,
	  where <replaceable>X</replaceable> stands for a
	  letter.</para>

	<para>In 5.0 or newer releases, simply use
	  <filename>/dev/fd<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>The Disk Size in 4.X and Earlier Releases</title>

	  <para>There are also <filename>/dev/fd<replaceable>N</replaceable>.<replaceable>size</replaceable></filename>
	    devices, where <replaceable>size</replaceable> is a floppy disk
	    size in kilobytes.  These entries are used at low-level format
	    time to determine the disk size.  1440kB is the size that will be 
	    used in the following examples.</para>

	  <para>Sometimes the entries under <filename>/dev</filename> will
	    have to be (re)created.  To do that, issue:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /dev && ./MAKEDEV "fd*"</userinput></screen>

	  <title>The Disk Size in 5.0 and Newer Releases</title>

	  <para>In 5.0, &man.devfs.5; will automatically
	    manage device nodes in <filename>/dev</filename>, so use of
	    <command>MAKEDEV</command> is not necessary.</para>
	  
	  <para>The desired disk size is passed to &man.fdformat.1; through
	    the <option>-f</option> flag.  Supported sizes are listed in
	  &man.fdcontrol.8;, but be advised that 1440kB is what works best.</para>

	<title>Formatting</title>

	<para>A floppy disk needs to be low-level formated before it
	  can be used.  This is usually done by the vendor, but
	  formatting is a good way to check media integrity.  Although
	  it is possible to force larger (or smaller) disk sizes,
	  1440kB is what most floppy disks are designed for.</para>

	<para>To low-level format the floppy disk you need to use
	  &man.fdformat.1;.  This utility expects the device name as an
	  argument.</para>

	  <para>Make note of any error messages, as these can help
	    determine if the disk is good or bad.</para>

	<sect4>
	  <title>Formatting in 4.X and Earlier Releases</title>

	  <para>Use the
	    <filename>/dev/fd<replaceable>N</replaceable>.<replaceable>size</replaceable></filename>
	    devices to format the floppy.  Insert a new 3.5inch floppy
	    disk in your drive and issue:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/usr/sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0.1440</userinput></screen>

      <title>The Disk Label</title>

      <para>After low-level formatting the disk, you will need to
	place a disk label on it.  This disk label will be destroyed
	later, but it is needed by the system to determine the size of
	the disk and its geometry later.</para>

      <para>The new disk label will take over the whole disk, and will
	contain all the proper information about the geometry of the
	floppy.  The geometry values for the disk label are listed in
	<filename>/etc/disktab</filename>.</para>

      <para>You can run now &man.disklabel.8; like so:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/sbin/disklabel -B -r -w /dev/fd0 fd1440</userinput></screen>

      <note><para>Since &os;&nbsp;5.1-RELEASE, the &man.bsdlabel.8;
	utility replaces the old &man.disklabel.8; program.  With
	&man.bsdlabel.8; a number of obsolete options and parameters
	have been retired; in the example above the option
	<option>-r</option> should be removed.  For more
	information, please refer to the &man.bsdlabel.8;
	manual page.</para></note>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The File System</title>

      <para>Now the floppy is ready to be high-level formated. This
	will place a new file system on it, which will let FreeBSD read
	and write to the disk.  After creating the new file system, the
	disk label is destroyed, so if you want to reformat the disk, you
	will have to recreate the disk label.</para>

      <para>The floppy's file system can be either UFS or FAT.
	 FAT is generally a better choice for floppies.</para>

      <para>To put a new file system on the floppy, issue:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>/sbin/newfs_msdos /dev/fd0</userinput></screen>

      <para>The disk is now ready for use.</para>

      <title>Using the Floppy</title>

      <para>To use the floppy, mount it with &man.mount.msdos.8; (in
	4.X and earlier releases) or &man.mount.msdosfs.8; (in 5.0 or
	newer releases).  One can also use

      <para>8mm tapes are the most common SCSI tape drives; they are the best
	choice of exchanging tapes.  Nearly every site has an Exabyte 2&nbsp;GB 8mm
	tape drive.  8mm drives are reliable, convenient and quiet. Cartridges
	are inexpensive and small (4.8 x 3.3 x 0.6 inches; 122 x 84 x 15 mm).
	One downside of 8mm tape is relatively short head and tape life due to
	the high rate of relative motion of the tape across the heads.</para>

      <para>Data throughput ranges from ~250&nbsp;kB/s to ~500&nbsp;kB/s.  Data sizes start
	at 300&nbsp;MB and go up to 7&nbsp;GB.  Hardware compression, available with
	most of these drives, approximately doubles the capacity.  These
	drives are available as single units or multi-drive tape libraries
	with 6 drives and 120 tapes in a single cabinet.  Tapes are changed
	automatically by the unit.  Library capacities reach 840+&nbsp;GB.</para>

      <para>The Exabyte <quote>Mammoth</quote> model supports 12&nbsp;GB on one tape
	(24&nbsp;GB with compression) and costs approximately twice as much as
	conventional tape drives.</para>

      <para>Data is recorded onto the tape using helical-scan, the heads are
	positioned at an angle to the media (approximately 6 degrees).  The
	tape wraps around 270 degrees of the spool that holds the heads.  The
	spool spins while the tape slides over the spool.  The result is a
	high density of data and closely packed tracks that angle across the
	tape from one edge to the other.</para>

      <para>QIC-150 tapes and drives are, perhaps, the most common tape drive
	and media around.  QIC tape drives are the least expensive <quote>serious</quote>
	backup drives.  The downside is the cost of media.  QIC tapes are
	expensive compared to 8mm or 4mm tapes, up to 5 times the price per GB
	data storage.  But, if your needs can be satisfied with a half-dozen
	tapes, QIC may be the correct choice.  QIC is the
	<emphasis>most</emphasis> common tape drive.  Every site has a QIC
	drive of some density or another.  Therein lies the rub, QIC has a
	large number of densities on physically similar (sometimes identical)
	tapes.  QIC drives are not quiet.  These drives audibly seek before
	they begin to record data and are clearly audible whenever reading,
	writing or seeking.  QIC tapes measure (6 x 4 x 0.7 inches; 15.2 x
	10.2 x 1.7 mm).  <link

	ranges from 40&nbsp;MB to 15&nbsp;GB.  Hardware compression is available on many
	of the newer QIC drives.  QIC drives are less frequently installed;
	they are being supplanted by DAT drives.</para>

      <para>Data is recorded onto the tape in tracks.  The tracks run along
	the long axis of the tape media from one end to the other.  The number
	of tracks, and therefore the width of a track, varies with the tape's
	capacity.  Most if not all newer drives provide backward-compatibility
	at least for reading (but often also for writing).  QIC has a good

	mechanism opens this gate to extract the tape leader.  The tape leader
	has an oval hole in it which the drive uses to <quote>hook</quote> the tape.  The
	take-up spool is located inside the tape drive.  All the other tape

	both the supply and take-up spools located inside the tape cartridge
	itself.</para>

      <para>Data throughput is approximately 1.5&nbsp;MB/s, three times the throughput of
	4mm, 8mm, or QIC tape drives.  Data capacities range from 10&nbsp;GB to 20&nbsp;GB

      <para><application>Amanda</application> (Advanced Maryland
        Network Disk Archiver) is a client/server backup system,
        rather than a single program.  An <application>Amanda</application> server will backup to
        a single tape drive any number of computers that have <application>Amanda</application>
        clients and a network connection to the <application>Amanda</application> server.  A
        common problem at sites with a number of large disks is
        that the length of time required to backup to data directly to tape
        exceeds the amount of time available for the task.  <application>Amanda</application>
        solves this problem.  <application>Amanda</application> can use a <quote>holding disk</quote> to
        backup several file systems at the same time.  <application>Amanda</application> creates
        <quote>archive sets</quote>: a group of tapes used over a period of time to
        create full backups of all the file systems listed in <application>Amanda</application>'s
        configuration file.  The <quote>archive set</quote> also contains nightly
        incremental (or differential) backups of all the file systems.
        Restoring a damaged file system requires the most recent full
        backup and the incremental backups.</para>

      <para>The configuration file provides fine control of backups and the
	network traffic that <application>Amanda</application> generates.  <application>Amanda</application> will use any of the
	above backup programs to write the data to tape.  <application>Amanda</application> is available
	as either a port or a package, it is not installed by default.</para>

      <title>Do Nothing</title>

      <para><quote>Do nothing</quote> is not a computer program, but it is the
	most widely used backup strategy.  There are no initial costs.  There
	is no backup schedule to follow.  Just say no.  If something happens
	to your data, grin and bear it!</para>

      <para>If your time and your data is worth little to nothing, then
	<quote>Do nothing</quote> is the most suitable backup program for your
	computer.  But beware, &unix; is a useful tool, you may find that within
	six months you have a collection of files that are valuable to
	you.</para>

      <para><quote>Do nothing</quote> is the correct backup method for
	<filename>/usr/obj</filename> and other directory trees that can be
	exactly recreated by your computer.  An example is the files that
	comprise the HTML or &postscript; version of this Handbook.
	These document formats have been created from SGML input
	files.  Creating backups of the HTML or &postscript; files is
	not necessary.  The SGML files are backed up regularly.</para>

	file systems is <command>dump</command>.  Elizabeth created file systems containing
	a large variety of unusual conditions (and some not so unusual ones)
	and tested each program by doing a backup and restore of those
	file systems.  The peculiarities included: files with holes, files with
	holes and a block of nulls, files with funny characters in their
	names, unreadable and unwritable files, devices, files that change
	size during the backup, files that are created/deleted during the
	backup and more.  She presented the results at LISA V in Oct. 1991.

      <sect3>
	<title>Before the Disaster</title>

	<para>There are only four steps that you need to perform in
	  preparation for any disaster that may occur.</para>
	<indexterm>
    <primary><command>disklabel</command></primary>
  </indexterm>

	<para>First, print the disklabel from each of your disks
	  (e.g. <command>disklabel da0 | lpr</command>), your file system table
	  (<filename>/etc/fstab</filename>) and all boot messages,
	  two copies of
	  each.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>fix-it floppies</primary></indexterm>
	<para>Second, determine that the boot and fix-it floppies
	  (<filename>boot.flp</filename> and <filename>fixit.flp</filename>)
	  have all your devices.  The easiest way to check is to reboot your
	  machine with the boot floppy in the floppy drive and check the boot
	  messages.  If all your devices are listed and functional, skip on to
	  step three.</para>

	<para>Otherwise, you have to create two custom bootable
	  floppies which have a kernel that can mount all of your disks
	  and access your tape drive.  These floppies must contain:
	  <command>fdisk</command>, <command>disklabel</command>,
	  <command>newfs</command>, <command>mount</command>, and
	  whichever backup program you use.  These programs must be
	  statically linked.  If you use <command>dump</command>, the
	  floppy must contain <command>restore</command>.</para>

	<para>Third, create backup tapes regularly.  Any changes that you make
	  after your last backup may be irretrievably lost.  Write-protect the
	  backup tapes.</para>

	<para>Fourth, test the floppies (either <filename>boot.flp</filename>
	  and <filename>fixit.flp</filename> or the two custom bootable
	  floppies you made in step two.) and backup tapes.  Make notes of the
	  procedure.  Store these notes with the bootable floppy, the
	  printouts and the backup tapes.  You will be so distraught when
	  restoring that the notes may prevent you from destroying your backup
	  tapes (How? In place of <command>tar xvf /dev/sa0</command>, you
	  might accidentally type <command>tar cvf /dev/sa0</command> and
	  over-write your backup tape).</para>

	<para>For an added measure of security, make bootable floppies and two
	  backup tapes each time.  Store one of each at a remote location.  A
	  remote location is NOT the basement of the same office building.  A
	  number of firms in the World Trade Center learned this lesson the
	  hard way.  A remote location should be physically separated from
	  your computers and disk drives by a significant distance.</para>

    <title>File System Snapshots</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>file systems</primary>
      <secondary>snapshots</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    
      <para>FreeBSD&nbsp;5.0 offers a new feature in conjunction with
	<link linkend="soft-updates">Soft Updates</link>: File system snapshots.</para>

      <para>Snapshots allow a user to create images of specified file
	systems, and treat them as a file.
	Snapshot files must be created in the file system that the
	action is performed on, and a user may create no more than 20
	snapshots per file system.  Active snapshots are recorded
	in the superblock so they are persistent across unmount and
	remount operations along with system reboots.  When a snapshot
	is no longer required, it can be removed with the standard &man.rm.1;
	command.  Snapshots may be removed in any order,
	however all the used space may not be acquired because another snapshot will
	possibly claim some of the released blocks.</para>

      <para>During initial creation, the <option>schg</option> flag (see the &man.chflags.1; manual page)
	is set to ensure that even <username>root</username> cannot write to the snapshot.
	The &man.unlink.1; command makes an exception for snapshot files
	since it allows them to be removed
	with the <option>schg</option> flag set, so it is not necessary to
	clear the <option>schg</option> flag before removing a snapshot file.</para>

      <para>Snapshots are created with the &man.mount.8; command.  To place
	a snapshot of <filename>/var</filename> in the file
	<filename>/var/snapshot/snap</filename> use the following
	command:</para>

<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -u -o snapshot /var/snapshot/snap /var</userinput></screen>

      <para>Alternatively, you can use &man.mksnap.ffs.8; to create
	a snapshot:</para>
<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mksnap_ffs /var /var/snapshot/snap</userinput></screen>

      <para>Once a snapshot has been created, it has several
	uses:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Some administrators will use a snapshot file for backup purposes,
	    because the snapshot can be transfered to CDs or tape.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>File integrity, &man.fsck.8; may be ran on the snapshot.
	    Assuming that the file system was clean when it was mounted, you
	    should always get a clean (and unchanging) result.
	    This is essentially what the
	    background &man.fsck.8; process does.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>Run the &man.dump.8; utility on the snapshot.
	    A dump will be returned that is consistent with the
	    file system and the timestamp of the snapshot.  &man.dump.8;
	    can also take a snapshot, create a dump image and then
	    remove the snapshot in one command using the
	    <option>-L</option> flag.</para>
	</listitem>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>&man.mount.8; the snapshot as a frozen image of the file system.
	    To &man.mount.8; the snapshot
	    <filename>/var/snapshot/snap</filename> run:</para>

<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /var/snapshot/snap -u 4</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount -r /dev/md4 /mnt</userinput></screen>

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>You can now walk the hierarchy of your frozen <filename>/var</filename>
	file system mounted at <filename>/mnt</filename>.  Everything will
	be in the same state it was during the snapshot creation time.
	The only exception is that any earlier snapshots will appear
	as zero length files.  When the use of a snapshot has delimited,
	it can be unmounted with:</para>

<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>umount /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mdconfig -d -u 4</userinput></screen>

    <para>Quotas are an optional feature of the operating system that
      allow you to limit the amount of disk space and/or the number of
      files a user or members of a group may allocate on a per-file
      system basis. This is used most often on timesharing systems where
      it is desirable to limit the amount of resources any one user or
      group of users may allocate.  This will prevent one user or group
      of users from consuming all of the available disk space.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring Your System to Enable Disk Quotas</title>

      <para>Before attempting to use disk quotas, it is necessary to make
	sure that quotas are configured in your kernel.  This is done by
	adding the following line to your kernel configuration
	file:</para>

      <programlisting>options QUOTA</programlisting>

      <para>The stock <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel does not have
	this enabled by default, so you will have to configure, build and
	install a custom kernel in order to use disk quotas.  Please refer
	to <xref linkend="kernelconfig"> for more information on kernel
	configuration.</para>

      <para>Next you will need to enable disk quotas in
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.  This is done by adding the
	line:</para>

      <programlisting>enable_quotas="YES"</programlisting>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>disk quotas</primary>
        <secondary>checking</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>For finer control over your quota startup, there is an
	additional configuration variable available. Normally on bootup,
	the quota integrity of each file system is checked by the
	&man.quotacheck.8; program.  The
	&man.quotacheck.8; facility insures that the data in
	the quota database properly reflects the data on the file system.
	This is a very time consuming process that will significantly
	affect the time your system takes to boot. If you would like to
	skip this step, a variable in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	is made available for the purpose:</para>

      <programlisting>check_quotas="NO"</programlisting>

      <para>If you are running FreeBSD prior to 3.2-RELEASE, the
	configuration is simpler, and consists of only one variable.  Set
	the following in your <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>check_quotas="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>Finally you will need to edit <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
	to enable disk quotas on a per-file system basis.  This is where
	you can either enable user or group quotas or both for all of your
	file systems.</para>

      <para>To enable per-user quotas on a file system, add the
	<option>userquota</option> option to the options field in the
	<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> entry for the file system you want
	to enable quotas on.  For example:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/da1s2g   /home    ufs rw,userquota 1 2</programlisting>

      <para>Similarly, to enable group quotas, use the
	<option>groupquota</option> option instead of
	<option>userquota</option>.  To enable both user and
	group quotas, change the entry as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>/dev/da1s2g    /home    ufs rw,userquota,groupquota 1 2</programlisting>

      <para>By default, the quota files are stored in the root directory of
	the file system with the names <filename>quota.user</filename> and
	<filename>quota.group</filename> for user and group quotas
	respectively.  See &man.fstab.5; for more
	information.  Even though the &man.fstab.5; manual page says that
	you can specify
	an alternate location for the quota files, this is not recommended
	because the various quota utilities do not seem to handle this
	properly.</para>

      <para>At this point you should reboot your system with your new
	kernel.  <filename>/etc/rc</filename> will automatically run the
	appropriate commands to  create the initial quota files for all of
	the quotas you enabled in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, so
	there is no need to manually create any zero length quota
	files.</para>

      <para>In the normal course of operations you should not be required
	to run the &man.quotacheck.8;,
	&man.quotaon.8;, or &man.quotaoff.8;
	commands manually.  However, you may want to read their manual pages
	just to be familiar with their operation.</para>

      <title>Setting Quota Limits</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>disk quotas</primary>
        <secondary>limits</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Once you have configured your system to enable quotas, verify
	that they really are enabled.  An easy way to do this is to
	run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>quota -v</userinput></screen>
	  
      <para>You should see a one line summary of disk usage and current
	quota limits for each file system that quotas are enabled
	on.</para>

      <para>You are now ready to start assigning quota limits with the
	&man.edquota.8; command.</para>

      <para>You have several options on how to enforce limits on the
	amount of disk space a user or group may allocate, and how many
	files they may create.  You may limit allocations based on disk
	space (block quotas) or number of files (inode quotas) or a
	combination of both.  Each of these limits are further broken down
	into two categories: hard and soft limits.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>hard limit</primary></indexterm>
      <para>A hard limit may not be exceeded.  Once a user reaches his
	hard limit he may not make any further allocations on the file
	system in question.  For example, if the user has a hard limit of
	500 blocks on a file system and is currently using 490 blocks, the
	user can only allocate an additional 10 blocks.  Attempting to
	allocate an additional 11 blocks will fail.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>soft limit</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Soft limits, on the other hand, can be exceeded for a limited
	amount of time.  This period of time is known as the grace period,
	which is one week by default.  If a user stays over his or her
	soft limit longer than the grace period, the soft limit will
	turn into a hard limit and no further allocations will be allowed.
	When the user drops back below the soft limit, the grace period
	will be reset.</para>

      <para>The following is an example of what you might see when you run
	the &man.edquota.8; command.  When the
	&man.edquota.8; command is invoked, you are placed into
	the editor specified by the <envar>EDITOR</envar> environment
	variable, or in the <application>vi</application> editor if the
	<envar>EDITOR</envar> variable is not set, to allow you to edit
	the quota limits.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>edquota -u test</userinput></screen>

      <programlisting>Quotas for user test:
/usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)
        inodes in use: 7, limits (soft = 50, hard = 60)
/usr/var: blocks in use: 0, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)
        inodes in use: 0, limits (soft = 50, hard = 60)</programlisting>

      <para>You will normally see two lines for each file system that has
	quotas enabled.  One line for the block limits, and one line for
	inode limits.  Simply change the value you want updated to modify
	the quota limit.  For example, to raise this user's block limit
	from a soft limit of 50 and a hard limit of 75 to a soft limit of
	500 and a hard limit of 600, change:</para>

      <programlisting>/usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 50, hard = 75)</programlisting>

      <para>to:</para>

      <programlisting> /usr: blocks in use: 65, limits (soft = 500, hard = 600)</programlisting>

      <para>The new quota limits will be in place when you exit the
	editor.</para>

      <para>Sometimes it is desirable to set quota limits on a range of
	UIDs.  This can be done by use of the <option>-p</option> option
	on the &man.edquota.8; command.  First, assign the
	desired quota limit to a user, and then run
	<command>edquota -p protouser startuid-enduid</command>.  For
	example, if user <username>test</username> has the desired quota
	limits, the following command can be used to duplicate those quota
	limits for UIDs 10,000 through 19,999:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>edquota -p test 10000-19999</userinput></screen>

      </indexterm>

      <para>You can use either the &man.quota.1; or the
	&man.repquota.8; commands to check quota limits and
	disk usage.  The &man.quota.1; command can be used to
	check individual user or group quotas and disk usage.  A user
	may only examine his own quota, and the quota of a group he
	is a member of. Only the super-user may view all user and group
	quotas.  The
	&man.repquota.8; command can be used to get a summary
	of all quotas and disk usage for file systems with quotas
	enabled.</para>

      <para>The following is some sample output from the
	<command>quota -v</command> command for a user that has quota
	limits on two file systems.</para>

      <programlisting>Disk quotas for user test (uid 1002):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
           /usr      65*     50      75   5days       7      50      60
       /usr/var       0      50      75               0      50      60</programlisting>

      <indexterm><primary>grace period</primary></indexterm>
      <para>On the <filename>/usr</filename> file system in the above
	example, this user is currently 15 blocks over the soft limit of
	50 blocks and has 5 days of the grace period left.  Note the
	asterisk <literal>*</literal> which indicates that the user is
	currently over his quota limit.</para>

      <para>Normally file systems that the user is not using any disk
	space on will not show up in the output from the
	&man.quota.1; command, even if he has a quota limit
	assigned for that file system.  The <option>-v</option> option
	will display those file systems, such as the
	<filename>/usr/var</filename> file system in the above
	example.</para>

    <title>Encrypting Disk Partitions</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>disks</primary>
      <secondary>encrypting</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>FreeBSD offers excellent online protections against
      unauthorized data access.  File permissions and Mandatory
      Access Control (MAC) (see <xref linkend="mac">) help prevent
      unauthorized third-parties from accessing data while the operating
      system is active and the computer is powered up. However,
      the permissions enforced by the operating system are irrelevant if an
      attacker has physical access to a computer and can simply move
      the computer's hard drive to another system to copy and analyze
      the sensitive data.</para>

    <para>Regardless of how an attacker may have come into possession of
      a hard drive or powered-down computer, <application>GEOM Based Disk
      Encryption (gbde)</application> can protect the data on the
      computer's file systems against even highly-motivated attackers
      with significant resources. Unlike cumbersome encryption methods
      that encrypt only individual files, <application>gbde</application>
      transparently encrypts entire file systems. No cleartext ever
      touches the hard drive's platter.</para>

      <title>Preparing the Encrypted Hard Drive</title>

      <para>The following example assumes that you are adding a new hard
	drive to your system that will hold a single encrypted partition.
	This partition will be mounted as <filename>/private</filename>.
	<application>gbde</application> can also be used to encrypt
	<filename>/home</filename> and <filename>/var/mail</filename>, but
	this requires more complex instructions which exceed the scope of
	this introduction.</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Add the New Hard Drive</title>

	  <para>Install the new drive to the system as explained in <xref
	    linkend="disks-adding">. For the purposes of this example,
	    a new hard drive partition has been added as
	    <devicename>/dev/ad4s1c</devicename>. The
	    <devicename>/dev/ad0s1<replaceable>*</replaceable></devicename>
	    devices represent existing standard FreeBSD partitions on
	    the example system.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ls /dev/ad*</userinput>
/dev/ad0        /dev/ad0s1b     /dev/ad0s1e     /dev/ad4s1

	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Create a Directory to Hold gbde Lock Files</title>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /etc/gbde</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The <application>gbde</application> lock file contains
	    information that <application>gbde</application> requires to
	    access encrypted partitions. Without access to the lock file,
	    <application>gbde</application> will not be able to decrypt
	    the data contained in the encrypted partition without
	    significant manual intervention which is not supported by the
	    software. Each encrypted partition uses a separate lock
	    file.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Initialize the gbde Partition</title>

	  <para>A <application>gbde</application> partition must be
	    initialized before it can be used. This initialization needs to
	    be performed only once:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gbde init /dev/ad4s1c -i -L /etc/gbde/ad4s1c</userinput></screen>

	  <para>&man.gbde.8; will open your editor, permitting you to set
	    various configuration options in a template. For use with UFS1
	    or UFS2, set the sector_size to 2048:</para>

	  <programlisting>$<!-- This is not the space you are looking
for-->FreeBSD: src/sbin/gbde/template.txt,v 1.1 2002/10/20 11:16:13 phk Exp $
#
# Sector size is the smallest unit of data which can be read or written.
# Making it too small decreases performance and decreases available space.
# Making it too large may prevent filesystems from working.  512 is the
# minimum and always safe.  For UFS, use the fragment size
#
sector_size     =       2048
[...]
</programlisting>

	  <para>&man.gbde.8; will ask you twice to type the passphrase that
	    should be used to secure the data. The passphrase must be the
	    same both times. <application>gbde</application>'s ability to
	    protect your data depends entirely on the quality of the
	    passphrase that you choose.
	  <footnote>
          <para>For tips on how to select a secure passphrase that is easy
	    to remember, see the <ulink
	    url="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware
	    Passphrase</ulink> website.</para></footnote></para>

	  <para>The <command>gbde init</command> command creates a lock
	    file for your <application>gbde</application> partition that in
	    this example is stored as
	    <filename>/etc/gbde/ad4s1c</filename>.</para>

	  <caution>
	    <para><application>gbde</application> lock files
	      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be backed up together with the
	      contents of any encrypted partitions. While deleting a lock
	      file alone cannot prevent a determined attacker from
	      decrypting a <application>gbde</application> partition,
	      without the lock file, the legitimate owner will be unable
	      to access the data on the encrypted partition without a
	      significant amount of work that is totally unsupported by
	      &man.gbde.8; and its designer.</para>
	  </caution>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Attach the Encrypted Partition to the Kernel</title>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gbde attach /dev/ad4s1c -l /etc/gbde/ad4s1c</userinput></screen>

	  <para> You will be asked to provide the passphrase that you
	    selected during the initialization of the encrypted partition.
	    The new encrypted device will show up in
	    <filename>/dev</filename> as
	    <filename>/dev/device_name.bde</filename>:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>ls /dev/ad*</userinput>

	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Create a File System on the Encrypted Device</title>

	  <para>Once the encrypted device has been attached to the kernel,
	    you can create a file system on the device. To create a file
	    system on the encrypted device, use &man.newfs.8;. Since it is
	    much faster to initialize a new UFS2 file system than it is to
	    initialize the old UFS1 file system, using &man.newfs.8; with
	    the <option>-O2</option> option is recommended.</para>

	  <note><para>The <option>-O2</option> option is the default
	  with &os;&nbsp;5.1-RELEASE and later.</para></note>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs -U -O2 /dev/ad4s1c.bde</userinput></screen>

	  <note>
	    <para>The &man.newfs.8; command must be performed on an
	      attached <application>gbde</application> partition which
	      is identified by a
	      <filename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.bde</filename>
	      extension to the device name.</para>

      <title>Mounting Existing Encrypted File Systems</title>

      <para>After each boot, any encrypted file systems must be
	re-attached to the kernel, checked for errors, and mounted, before
	the file systems can be used. The required commands must be
	executed as user <username>root</username>.</para>

	<step>
	  <title>Check the File System for Errors</title>

	  <para>Since encrypted file systems cannot yet be listed in
	    <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> for automatic mounting, the
	    file systems must be checked for errors by running &man.fsck.8;
	    manually before mounting.</para>

	<title>Automatically Mounting Encrypted Partitions</title>

	<para>It is possible to create a script to automatically attach,
	  check, and mount an encrypted partition, but for security reasons
	  the script should not contain the &man.gbde.8; password. Instead,
	  it is recommended that such scripts be run manually while
	  providing the password via the console or &man.ssh.1;.</para>

	<title>Cryptographic Protections Employed by gbde</title>

	<para>&man.gbde.8; encrypts the sector payload using 128-bit AES in

	<title>Compatibility Issues</title>

	<para>&man.sysinstall.8; is incompatible with
	  <application>gbde</application>-encrypted devices. All
	  <devicename><replaceable>*</replaceable>.bde</devicename> devices must be detached from the
	  kernel before starting &man.sysinstall.8; or it will crash during
	  its initial probing for devices. To detach the encrypted device
	  used in our example, use the following command:</para>
	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>gbde detach /dev/ad4s1c</userinput></screen>

      <para>Also note that, as &man.vinum.4; does not use the
