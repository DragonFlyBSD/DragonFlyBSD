This is the top level of the DragonFly source directory.

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some
sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the DragonFly source tree, the most
commonly used being ``buildworld'' and ``installworld'', which rebuild
and install everything in the DragonFly system from the source tree
except the kernel, the kernel-modules and the contents of /etc.  The
``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat involved process.  Documentation
for it can be found at:
   http://www.dragonflybsd.org/docs/newhandbook/
Also see the build(7) and config(8) man pages.

Note: If you want to build and install the kernel with the
``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets, you might need to build
world before.  More information is available in the DragonFly handbook.

The sample kernel configuration files reside in the sys/config
sub-directory (assuming that you've installed the kernel sources), the
file named GENERIC being the one used to build your initial installation
kernel.  The file LINT contains entries for all possible devices, not
just those commonly used, and is meant more as a general reference
than an actual kernel configuration file (a kernel built from it
wouldn't even run).
