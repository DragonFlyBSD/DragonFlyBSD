The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the DragonFly source tree, the most
commonly used one being ``world'', which rebuilds and installs
everything in the DragonFly system from the source tree except the
kernel, the kernel-modules and the contents of /etc.  The
``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat involved process.  Documentation
for it can be found at:
   http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html
Although the above reference is FreeBSD-specific, it is also generally
applicable to DragonFly.  Also see the the config(8) man page.

Note: If you want to build and install the kernel with the
``buildkernel'' and ``installkernel'' targets, you might need to build
world before.  More information is available in the FreeBSD handbook.

The sample kernel configuration files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf
sub-directory (assuming that you've installed the kernel sources), the
file named GENERIC being the one used to build your initial installation
kernel.  The file LINT contains entries for all possible devices, not
just those commonly used, and is meant more as a general reference
than an actual kernel configuration file (a kernel built from it
wouldn't even run).
