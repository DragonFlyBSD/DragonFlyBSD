# /etc/devtab
#
# This file contains label conversions for fstab, mount, fsck, hammer,
# and other commands which expect device paths.  It is typically used
# to translate longer serial numbers (which devfs automatically installs
# as "/dev/serno/<serialnumber>[.suffix]" into short-form names to simplify
# fstab.
#
# For use cases a label is represented up to the last '.' (if any),
# looked up, and then any suffix after and including the leading '.' is
# tacked onto the result.  So in /etc/fstab the label "fubar.s1a"
# would translate to "/dev/serno/L123456.s1a" in our first example below.
#
# Currently the "serno" and "path" types are supported.  Really any generic
# type is supported and will translate into a subdirectory lookup in /dev.
# The "path" type translates to an absolute path with no prepended /dev,
# suitable for files represented by block devices.
#
# label		type		basepath
# -----		------		-------
# fubar		serno		L123456
# fubar		path		/full/path
