# This file, if present, will be read by make (see /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).
# It allows you to override macro definitions to make without changing
# your source tree, or anything the source tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# You have to find the things you can put here in the Makefiles and 
# documentation of the source tree.
#
# The CPUTYPE variable controls which processor should be targeted for
# generated code.  This controls processor-specific optimizations in
# certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value
# of CFLAGS to contain the appropriate optimization directive to gcc.
# The automatic setting of CFLAGS may be overridden using the
# NO_CPU_CFLAGS variable below.
# Currently the following CPU types are recognized:
#   Intel x86 architecture:
#       (AMD CPUs)	k7 k6-2 k6 k5
#       (Intel CPUs)	p4 p3 p2 i686 i586/mmx i586 i486 i386
#
# If you experience any problems after setting this flag, please unset
# it again before submitting a bug report or attempting to modify code.
# It may be that certain types of software will become unstable after being
# compiled with processor-specific (or higher - see below) optimization flags.
# If in doubt, do not set CPUTYPE or CFLAGS to non-default values.
#
#CPUTYPE=i686
#NO_CPU_CFLAGS=	true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to CFLAGS automatically
#NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS=true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to COPTFLAGS automatically
#
# The CCVER variable controls which GCC-version to use by default.  It
# should be set using ?= so as not to interfere with CCVER overrides from
# userland or the buildworld.  We currently recommend that an override NOT
# be set in /etc/make.conf and that gcc 3.4 not yet be used to build the boot
# blocks, boot loader, or the kernel.
#
#CCVER?=gcc34	# (use GCC 3.4, default)
#CCVER?=gcc40	# (use GCC 4.0, experimental, must define WANT_GCC40)
#
# Build gcc40 with world.  This won't make gcc40 the default compiler
#WANT_GCC40=yes
# 
# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimization settings above -O (-O2, ...) are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimization settings to "-O" before submitting bug reports
# to the developers.
#
#CFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.
#
#CXXFLAGS+= -fmemoize-lookups -fsave-memoized
#
# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
# for use in developing FreeBSD and testing changes.  They can be used by
# putting "CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}" in /etc/make.conf.  -Wconversion is not
# included here due to compiler bugs, e.g., mkdir()'s mode_t argument.

#	SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
#	SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl2
#
# Note: If you are using Cyrus SASL with other applications which require

#
#	define(`confDONT_BLAME_SENDMAIL',`GroupReadableSASLDBFile')
#
#SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDADD=

# Setting SENDMAIL_SET_USER_ID will install the sendmail binary as a

# prevent the installation of /etc/mail/submit.cf.
# This is a deprecated mode of operation.  See etc/mail/README for more
