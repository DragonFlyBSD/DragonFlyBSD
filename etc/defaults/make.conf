#
# NOTE:  Please would any committer updating this file also update the
# make.conf(5) manual page, if necessary, which is located in
# src/share/man/man5/make.conf.5.
#
# This file, if present, will be read by make (see /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).
# It allows you to override macro definitions to make without changing
# your source tree, or anything the source tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# You have to find the things you can put here in the Makefiles and 
# documentation of the source tree.
#
# The CPUTYPE variable controls which processor should be targeted for
# generated code.  This controls processor-specific optimizations in
# certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value
# of CFLAGS to contain the appropriate optimization directive to gcc.
# The automatic setting of CFLAGS may be overridden using the
# NO_CPU_CFLAGS variable below.
# Currently the following CPU types are recognized:
#   Intel x86 architecture:
#       (AMD CPUs)	opteron athlon-fx athlon64 k8 k7 k6-3 k6-2 k6 k5
#       (Intel CPUs)	p4 pentium-m p3 p2 i686 i586/mmx i586 i486
#
# If you experience any problems after setting this flag, please unset
# it again before submitting a bug report or attempting to modify code.
# It may be that certain types of software will become unstable after being
# compiled with processor-specific (or higher - see below) optimization flags.
# If in doubt, do not set CPUTYPE or CFLAGS to non-default values.
#
#CPUTYPE=i686
#NO_CPU_CFLAGS=	true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to CFLAGS automatically
#NO_CPU_COPTFLAGS=true	# Don't add -march=<cpu> to COPTFLAGS automatically
#
# The CCVER variable controls which GCC-version to use by default.  It
# should be set using ?= so as not to interfere with CCVER overrides from
# userland or the buildworld.  Note that building world or the kernel using
# an experimental compiler might be broken at any time.  We currently
# recommend that an override NOT be set in /etc/make.conf.
#
#CCVER?=gcc50	# (use GCC 5, default)
#
# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimization settings above -O (-O2, ...) are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimization settings to "-O" before submitting bug reports
# to the developers.
#
#CFLAGS= -O -pipe
#
# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.
#
#CXXFLAGS+= -fmemoize-lookups -fsave-memoized
#
# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
# for use in developing FreeBSD and testing changes.  They can be used by
# putting "CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}" in /etc/make.conf.  -Wconversion is not
# included here due to compiler bugs, e.g., mkdir()'s mode_t argument.
#
BDECFLAGS=	-W -Wall -ansi -pedantic -Wbad-function-cast -Wcast-align \
		-Wcast-qual -Wchar-subscripts -Winline \
		-Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -Wpointer-arith \
		-Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -Wwrite-strings
#
# To compile just the kernel with special optimizations, you should use
# this instead of CFLAGS (which is not applicable to kernel builds anyway).
# There is very little to gain by using higher optimization levels, and doing
# so can cause problems.
