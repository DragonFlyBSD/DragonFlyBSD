# For each custom compiler definition, it is mandatory to define the
# following variables:
#     <CCVER>_CC         (path to C compiler)
#     <CCVER>_CXX        (path to C++ compiler)
#     <CCVER>_CPP        (path to pre-processor)
#     <CCVER>_INCOPT     (include options for cc, c++ and cpp)
#     <CCVER>_INCOPTCXX  (extra include options for c++)
#
# The following variables are optional:
#     <CCVER>_CFLAGS     (extra CFLAGS)
#     <CCVER>_CXXFLAGS   (extra CXXFLAGS)
#     <CCVER>_CPPFLAGS   (extra CPPFLAGS)
#     <CCVER>_GCOV       (path to gcov, /usr/libexec/gcc50/gcov is default)
#
# The following commands call the base compilers by default:
#     gcc, g++, clang, clang++, clang-cpp
#
# However, these can be individually overridden:
#     <CCVER>_GCC        (path executed when /usr/bin/gcc called)
#     <CCVER>_GXX        (path executed when /usr/bin/g++ called)
#     <CCVER>_CLANG      (path executed when /usr/bin/clang called)
#     <CCVER>_CLANGCXX   (path executed when /usr/bin/clang++ called)
#     <CCVER>_CLANGCPP   (path executed when /usr/bin/clang-cpp called)
